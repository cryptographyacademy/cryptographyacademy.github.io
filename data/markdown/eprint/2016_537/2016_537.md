Abstract. In a recent work, Kim and Barbulescu showed how to combine previous polynomial selection methods with the extended tower number field sieve algorithm to obtain improved complexity for the discrete logarithm problem on finite fields Fp<sup>n</sup> for the medium prime case and where n is composite and not a prime-power. A follow up work by Sarkar and Singh presented a general polynomial selection method and showed how to lower the complexity in the medium prime case even when n is composite and a prime-power. This complexity, though, was higher than what was reported for the case of n composite and not a prime-power. By suitably combining the Conjugation method of polynomial selection proposed earlier by Barbulescu et al. with the extended tower number field sieve algorithm, Jeong and Kim showed that the same asymptotic complexity is achieved for any composite n. The present work generalises the polynomial selection method of Jeong and Kim for all composite n. Though the best complexity that can be achieved is not lowered, there is a significant range of finite fields for which the new algorithm achieves complexity which is lower than all previously proposed methods.

#### 1 Introduction

One of the important problems in cryptography is to compute discrete logarithms over the multiplicative group of a finite field. There are two known general approaches to this problem which lead to sub-exponential run-time. These are the function field sieve (FFS) [1, 2, 15, 17] and the number field sieve (NFS) [9, 16, 18] algorithms.

Let p be a prime, n ≥ 1 be an integer and Q = p <sup>n</sup>. Suppose that p = LQ(a, cp) where

$$L_Q(a, c_p) = \exp((c_p + o(1))(\ln Q)^a (\ln \ln Q)^{1-a}).$$

Depending on the value of a, fields F<sup>Q</sup> are classified into the following types: small characteristic, if a ≤ 1/3; medium characteristic, if 1/3 < a < 2/3; boundary, if a = 2/3; and large characteristic, if a > 2/3.

There has been tremendous progress in the FFS algorithm leading to a quasipolynomial time algorithm [5] for the small characteristic case. Using algorithms given in [14, 5], a record computation of discrete log in the binary extension field F2 <sup>9234</sup> was reported by Granger et al [10]. The FFS algorithm also applies to the medium prime case and this has been reported in [17, 13, 23].

The NFS algorithm is generally considered to be the state-of-the-art for medium to large characteristic finite fields. The application of NFS to compute discrete logarithms over finite fields was first proposed by Gordon [9] for prime order fields, i.e., for n = 1. Application to composite order fields, i.e., for n > 1, was shown by Schirokauer [27]. Important improvements to the NFS for prime order fields were given by Joux and Lercier [16]. Joux, Lercier, Smart and Vercauteren [18] showed that the NFS algorithm is applicable to all finite fields. When the prime p is of a special form, Joux and Pierrot [19] showed the application of the special number field sieve algorithm to obtain improved complexity.

The basic structure of the NFS algorithm is to construct two polynomials f(x) and g(x) over the integers which have a common factor ϕ(x) of degree n modulo p. The polynomial ϕ(x) defines the field Fp<sup>n</sup> while the polynomials f(x) and g(x) define two number fields. The efficiency of the NFS algorithm is crucially dependent on the properties of the polynomials f(x) and g(x) used to construct the number fields. Consequently, polynomial selection is an important step in the NFS algorithm and is an active area of research.

Sequence of recent works on NFS: Starting with the work of Barbulescu et al. [4], there have been several recent works which continuously improve polynomial selection algorithms.

- 1. Barbulescu et al. [4] introduced two new methods for polynomial selection, namely, the generalised Joux-Lercier (GJL) and the Conjugation method. For the boundary case, the best complexity obtained was LQ(1/3,(48/9)1/<sup>3</sup> ). The best complexities for the medium and the large prime cases were respectively LQ(1/3,(96/9)1/<sup>3</sup> ) and LQ(1/3,(64/9)1/<sup>3</sup> ).
- 2. Pierrot [22] worked out the asymptotic complexity of the multiple NFS (MNFS) for the GJL and the Conjugation methods and in all cases obtained lower values of the second term in the corresponding sub-exponential expressions.
- 3. Barbulescu et al. [6] provided a detailed analysis of the tower number field sieve (TNFS) variant which had earlier been proposed by Schirokauer [27].
- 4. Sarkar and Singh [25] provided a method (called Algorithm-A) for polynomial selection which both generalised and subsumed the GJL and the Conjugation methods. Asymptotic complexity for NFS and MNFS were worked out. The best reported complexities in [4] and [22] are obtained for one particular value of cp. While the new method of [25] could not lower these complexities, it was shown that there are significant ranges for the values of cp, where in comparison to [4, 22], lower asymptotic complexities are obtained.
- 5. Gaudry et al. [8] discussed practical issues in relation collection and the consequences of polynomial selection to this phase.

- 6. Kim and Barbulescu [21] (which is a merge of [20] and [3]) combined previous polynomial selection methods with the extended TNFS (exTNFS) algorithm to obtain improved complexities for the medium prime case when the extension degree n is composite and not a prime-power. The complexity they achieved is LQ(1/3,(48/9)1/<sup>3</sup> ) using classical NFS. An improvement of the second term of the sub-exponential expression was obtained using MNFS. The paper also reported improved complexities for special number field sieve algorithm.
- 7. Sarkar and Singh [26] provided an extension of Algorithm-A to provide a general method (called Algorithm-B) for polynomial selection for the case considered in [21], i.e., for composite n which is not a prime power. It was shown that in this setting, the GJL and the Conjugation method are special cases of Algorithm-B.
- 8. Sarkar and Singh [24] provided an extension of Algorithm-B called Algorithm-C which covered all composite n. When n is composite and a power of 2, the best complexity in the medium prime case using NFS was obtained to be LQ(1/3,(64/9)1/<sup>3</sup> ). Progressively higher best complexities were reported for other prime-power values of n.
- 9. Guillevic et al. [11] reported a computation of discrete logarithm on an 170 bit MNT curve. They used the Conjugation method for selecting polynomials.
- 10. Jeong and Kim [12] showed how to combine the Conjugation method with exTNFS to cover all composite extension degrees. In particular, they showed that using classical NFS, the best complexity obtained for composite n (irrespective of whether it is a prime-power or not) in the medium prime case is LQ(1/3,(48/9)1/<sup>3</sup> ).

The present paper provides a new general polynomial selection method, called Algorithm-D. This algorithm works for all composite values of n and has the Conjugation method as a special case in the exTNFS setting. The best complexity achieved for the medium prime case is LQ(1/3,(48/9)1/<sup>3</sup> ) for all composite n. This complexity is the same as that reported by Jeong and Kim [12]. On the other hand, for the medium prime case, there is a significant range of finite fields for which lower complexity is achieved. Suppose that n = ηκ and that η can be written as η = cη(ln Q/ln ln Q) <sup>2</sup>/3−<sup>a</sup> and let c<sup>θ</sup> = cpcη. For c<sup>θ</sup> ∈ [3.39, 20.91], the complexity of exTNFS-D is lower than the complexities of all previous algorithms whether classical or MTNFS. For c<sup>θ</sup> ∈ (0, 1.12) ∪ [1.45, 3.15], the complexity of MexTNFS-D is the same as that of MexTNFS-Conj and for c<sup>θ</sup> ∈/ (0, 1.12) ∪ [1.45, 3.15], the complexity of MexTNFS-D is lower than that of all previous methods.

We note that Algorithm-D does not subsume ether Algorithm-B or Algorithm-C. Though the asymptotic complexity obtained by Algorithm-D is lower than that of Algorithm-C, there are certain trade-offs in the norm bound that are achieved using Algorithm-C but, not using Algorithm-D.

There is a mis-conception appearing in several works that the Sarkar-Singh method from [25] (i.e., Algorithm-A) is applicable only when n is composite. We have noted that such comments appear in [21,11]. By extension, there may be a mis-conception that for composite  $n = \eta \kappa$ , Algorithms- $\mathcal{B}$ ,  $\mathcal{C}$  (from [26] and [24]) and  $\mathcal{D}$  appearing here are applicable only when  $\kappa$  is prime. We would like to clear this confusion.

- 1. Algorithm- $\mathcal{A}$  from [25] applies for all values of n. The algorithm has two parameters, namely a divisor d of n and a positive integer r such that  $r \geq n/d$ . For d=1, Algorithm- $\mathcal{A}$  reduces to the GJL method. For d=n, Algorithm- $\mathcal{A}$  provides a generalisation of the Conugation method; the conjugation method is obtained by choosing r=1; for certain ranges of  $c_p$ , it is possible to choose r>1 to obtain asymptotic complexity which is lower than the Conjugation method. The cases of d=1 and d=n apply irrespective of whether n is prime or composite. If further, n is composite, then it is possible to choose 1 < d < n to obtain new trade-offs on the norm bounds. We note that the work [8] correctly describes this set-up.
- 2. For Algorithms- $\mathcal{B}$  and  $\mathcal{C}$  the above statements apply with n replaced by  $\kappa$ . For Algorithm- $\mathcal{B}$ , the condition  $\gcd(\eta, \kappa) = 1$  is required while no such condition is required for Algorithm- $\mathcal{C}$ .
- 3. Algorithm- $\mathcal{D}$  has the parameters r and d with the condition that  $\gcd(\eta, \kappa/d) = 1$ . By suitably choosing d (for example choosing  $d = \kappa$ ), Algorithm- $\mathcal{D}$  can be made to work for all composite n. Choosing  $d = \kappa$  and r = 1 provides the Conjugation method in the exTNFS setting. Choosing r > 1 (or  $d < \kappa$ , if appropriate) provides a generalisation of the Conjugation method.

## 2 The Set-Up of the Tower Number Field Sieve Algorithm

The target is to compute discrete logarithm in the field  $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$  where n is composite. Suppose that  $n = \eta \kappa$  is a non-trivial factorisation of n.

Let h(z) be a monic polynomial of degree  $\eta$  which is irreducible over both  $\mathbb{Z}$  and  $\mathbb{F}_p$ . Let  $R = \mathbb{Z}[z]/(h(z))$ . Also, note that  $\mathbb{F}_{p^{\eta}} = \mathbb{F}_p[z]/(h(z))$ .

Let f(x) and g(x) be polynomials in R[x] whose leading coefficients are from  $\mathbb{Z}$ . The other coefficients of f and g are polynomials in z of degrees at most  $\eta-1$ . In particular, f and g can be viewed as bi-variate polynomials in x and z with coefficients in  $\mathbb{Z}$ . The following properties are required.

- 1. Both f(x) and g(x) are irreducible over R.
- 2. Over  $\mathbb{F}_{p^{\eta}}$ , f(x) and g(x) have a common factor  $\varphi(x)$  of degree  $\kappa$ .

The field  $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$  is realised as  $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}[x]/(\varphi(x)) = (R/pR)[x]/(\varphi(x))$ .

Let  $K_f$  and  $K_g$  be the number fields associated with the polynomials f and g respectively. The above set-up provides two different decompositions of a homomorphism from R[x] to  $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ . One of these goes through R[x]/(f(x)) and the other goes through R[x]/(g(x)).

With this set-up, it is possible to set up a factor base and perform the three main steps (relation collection, linear algebra and descent) of the NFS algorithm. For details we refer to [6, 21]. In this work, we will need only the following facts.

- 1. The factor base consists of B elements for some value B which determines the overall complexity of the algorithm.
- 2. A polynomial  $\phi(x) \in R[x]$  generates a relation if both the norms  $N(\phi, f)$  and  $N(\phi, g)$  are B-smooth, where

$$N(\phi, f) := \operatorname{Res}_{z}(\operatorname{Res}_{x}(\phi(x), f(x)), h(z));$$

$$N(\phi, g) := \operatorname{Res}_{z}(\operatorname{Res}_{x}(\phi(x), g(x)), h(z)).$$

#### 2.1 Bounds on Resultants

Let f(z,x) be a bivariate polynomial with integer coefficients where  $f_{i,j}$  is the coefficient of  $x^iz^j$ . Then

$$||f||_{\infty} = \max|f_{i,j}|.$$

Bounds on resultants of univariate and bivariate polynomials were given in [7]. In the following, we summarise these bounds.

Univariate polynomials: Let a(u) and b(u) be two polynomials with integer coefficients. From [7], we have

$$|\operatorname{Res}_{u}(a(u), b(u))| \le (\deg(a) + 1)^{\deg(b)/2} (\deg(b) + 1)^{\deg(a)/2} ||a||_{\infty}^{\deg(b)} \times ||b||_{\infty}^{\deg(a)}.$$
(1)

**Bivariate polynomials:** Let a(u, v) and b(u, v) be two polynomials with integer coefficients. Let  $c(u) = \text{Res}_v(a(u, v), b(u, v))$ . Then

$$||c||_{\infty}$$

$$\leq (\deg_{v}(a) + \deg_{v}(b))! (\max(\deg_{u}(a), \deg_{u}(b)) + 1)^{\deg_{v}(a) + \deg_{v}(b) + 1}$$

$$\times ||a||_{\infty}^{\deg_{v}(b)} \times ||b||_{\infty}^{\deg_{v}(a)}. \tag{2}$$

The bounds given by (1) and (2) combine to provide bounds on  $N(\phi, f)$ . Let  $\phi(x, z)$  and f(x, z) be two polynomials and

$$\rho(z) = \operatorname{Res}_x(\phi(x,z), f(x,z)).$$

Further, suppose  $\deg_x \phi \leq t-1$  and  $\deg_z \phi \leq \eta-1$ . For  $\|\phi\|_{\infty} = E^{2/(t\eta)}$ , the number of possible  $\phi(x,z)$ 's is  $E^2$ . Assuming that  $t,\eta,\deg_x f$  and  $\deg_z f$  are small in comparison to E, using (2) we have

$$\|\rho\|_{\infty} = O\left(E^{2\deg_x(f)/(t\eta)} \cdot \|f\|_{\infty}^{t-1}\right).$$

Suppose h(z) is a polynomial of degree  $\eta$  with  $||h||_{\infty} = H$ . Let

$$\Gamma = \operatorname{Res}_z \left( \operatorname{Res}_x(\phi(x), f(x)), h(z) \right).$$

Assuming that H is negligible in comparison to E, using (1) we have

$$\begin{split} |\Gamma| &= O\left(\left(\|\rho\|_{\infty}^{\eta} \cdot \|h\|_{\infty}^{\deg(\rho)}\right)\right) \\ &= O\left(E^{2\deg_x f/t} \cdot \|f\|_{\infty}^{\eta(t-1)}\right). \end{split}$$

Note that in the TNFS set-up described above  $N(\phi, f) = \Gamma$ .

Sieving polynomials: Sieving is done using polynomials  $\phi(x) \in R[x]$  of degrees at most t-1 with  $\|\phi\|_{\infty} = E^{2/\eta t}$ . Then the number of sieving polynomials is  $E^2$ .

### 3 A New Polynomial Selection Method for exTNFS

The work [4] provides two methods for selecting polynomials for the classical NFS algorithm. These are called the generalised Joux-Lercier (GJL) and the Conjugation method. The GJL method is based on an earlier method due to Joux and Lercier [16] and uses the LLL algorithm to select polynomials.

The GJL matrix: Given a monic polynomial  $\varphi(x) = \varphi_0 + \varphi_1 x + \dots + \varphi_{k-1} x^{k-1} + x^k$  with integer coefficients and  $r \geq k$ , define an  $(r+1) \times (r+1)$  matrix in the following manner.

$$M_{\varphi,r} = \begin{bmatrix} p & & & & \\ & \ddots & & & \\ & & \ddots & & \\ & & p & & \\ \varphi_0 & \varphi_1 & \cdots & \varphi_{n-1} & 1 & & \\ & & \ddots & \ddots & & \ddots & \\ & & \varphi_0 & \varphi_1 & \cdots & \varphi_{n-1} & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$
(3)

Apply the LLL algorithm to  $M_{\varphi,r}$  and let the first row of the resulting LLL-reduced matrix be  $[\psi_0, \dots, \psi_r]$ . This vector is taken to represent a polynomial  $\psi(x) = \psi_0 + \psi_1 x + \dots + \psi_r x^r$  and we write

$$LLL(M_{\varphi,r}) = \psi(x) = \psi_0 + \psi_1 x + \dots + \psi_r x^r$$
(4)

to denote the polynomial  $\psi(x)$ . The determinant of  $M_{\varphi,r}$  is  $p^k$  and so by the LLL-reduced property,  $\|\varphi\|_{\infty} = O(p^{k/(r+1)})$ . If  $Q = p^n$ , then  $\|\varphi\|_{\infty} = O(Q^{k/(n(r+1))})$ .

Algorithm  $\mathcal{D}$  describes the polynomial selection method for the extended TNFS. It has the condition  $\gcd(\eta,k)=1$ , where  $k=\kappa/d$ . The reason is the following. The polynomial  $A_1(x)$  has integer entries and we wish to factorise  $A_1(x)$  over  $\mathbb{F}_p$  to obtain a factor  $A_2(x)$  of degree k. This  $A_2(x)$  is later used to define the polynomial  $\varphi(x)$  which is required to be irreducible over  $\mathbb{F}_{p^{\eta}}$ . A necessary condition is that  $A_2(x)$  must itself be irreducible over  $\mathbb{F}_{p^{\eta}}$ . Since  $A_2(x)$  is a polynomial of degree k with coefficients from  $\mathbb{F}_p$  which is required to be irreducible over  $\mathbb{F}_{p^{\eta}}$ , it is necessary that  $\gcd(\eta,k)=1$ . This condition, however, does not restrict applicability. One can always choose  $d=\kappa$  to obtain k=1 and so  $\gcd(\eta,k)=1$ . Other values of d may also be appropriate, eg., if  $\eta=3$  and  $\kappa=4$ , then one can choose d=2.

If  $d = \kappa$  and r = 1, then we obtain exactly the polynomial selection method proposed by Jeong and Kim [12] which is essentially the Conjugation method

#### Algorithm: D: Polynomial selection for TNFS. Input: p, n = ηκ, d (such that d|κ and gcd(η, d/κ) = 1) and r ≥ d/κ. Output: h(z), f(x), g(x) and ϕ(x). Choose h(z) to be a monic polynomial of degree η with small integer coefficients such that h(z) is irreducible over Fp; let k = κ/d; let R = Z[z]/(h(z)); let Fp<sup>η</sup> = Fp[z]/(h(z)); repeat randomly choose a monic polynomial A1(x) ∈ Z[x] having the following properties: deg A1(x) = r + 1; A1(x) is irreducible over Z; A1(x) has coefficients of size O(ln(p)); over Fp, A1(x) has a factor A2(x) of degree k such that A2(x) is irreducible over Fp<sup>η</sup> . randomly choose monic polynomials C0(x) and C1(x) in R such that kCik<sup>∞</sup> is small for i = 0, 1; deg C0(x) = d and deg C1(x) < d; define f(x) = Res<sup>y</sup> (A1(y), C0(x) + y C1(x)) ; ϕ(x) = Res<sup>y</sup> (A2(y), C0(x) + y C1(x)) mod p; ψ(x) = LLL(M<sup>A</sup>2,r); g(x) = Res<sup>y</sup> (ψ(y), C0(x) + y C1(x)).

in the exTNFS setting. Allowing r > 1 (or d < κ) provides a generalisation and leads to lower asymptotic complexity for certain ranges of finite fields.

until f(x) and g(x) are irreducible over Q[z]/(h(z)) (and hence over R) and

The following result states the basic properties of Algorithm D. Bounds on the norms are obtained from the bounds on resultants given in [7] (see Section 2.1).

Proposition 1. The outputs f(x), g(x) and ϕ(x) of Algorithm D satisfy the following.

```
1. deg(f) = d(r + 1); deg(g) = rd and deg(ϕ) = κ;
2. over Fpn , both f(x) and g(x) have ϕ(x) as a factor;
3. kfk∞ = O(ln(p)) and kgk∞ = O(Qk/(n(r+1))).
```

ϕ(x) is irreducible over Fp<sup>η</sup> = Fp[z]/(h(z)).

return h(z), f(x), g(x) and ϕ(x).

Consequently, if  $\phi$  is a sieving polynomial, then

$$N(\phi, f) = E^{2d(r+1)/t} \times L_Q(2/3, o(1)); \tag{5}$$

$$N(\phi,g) = E^{2dr/t} \times Q^{\frac{(t-1)k}{\kappa(r+1)}} \times L_Q(2/3,o(1))$$

$$= E^{2\kappa r/t} \times Q^{\frac{t-1}{d(r+1)}} \times L_Q(2/3, o(1)); \tag{6}$$

$$N(\phi, f) \times N(\phi, g) = E^{(2d(2r+1))/t} \times Q^{\frac{t-1}{d(r+1)}} L_Q(2/3, o(1)).$$
 (7)

We explain the main differences between Algorithm- $\mathcal{D}$  and Algorithms- $\mathcal{C}$  and  $\mathcal{B}$  described in [26] and [24] respectively.

**Differences in Algorithm-** $\mathcal{D}$  and Algorithm- $\mathcal{B}$ : Following [21], Algorithm- $\mathcal{B}$  requires the condition  $\gcd(\eta, \kappa) = 1$ . On the other hand, Algorithm- $\mathcal{D}$  has the condition  $\gcd(\eta, k) = 1$ . The two conditions are not equivalent and neither do one follow from the other. Further, in Algorithm- $\mathcal{B}$ , the polynomials  $C_0(x)$  and  $C_1(x)$  are restricted to have integer coefficients, while in Algorithm- $\mathcal{D}$  these polynomials have coefficients from R.

**Differences in Algorithm-** $\mathcal{D}$  and **Algorithm-** $\mathcal{B}$ : In Algorithm- $\mathcal{C}$ , the polynomials  $A_1(x)$  and  $A_2(x)$  were allowed to have coefficients from  $\mathbb{F}_{p^{\eta}}$  while the polynomials  $C_0(x)$  and  $C_1(x)$  were restricted to have coefficients in  $\mathbb{Z}$ . On the other hand, Algorithm- $\mathcal{D}$  restricts  $A_1(x)$  and  $A_2(x)$  to have coefficients in  $\mathbb{Z}$  whereas polynomials  $C_0(x)$  and  $C_1(x)$  are allowed to have coefficients from  $\mathbb{F}_{p^{\eta}}$ .

### 4 Examples

We provide examples of polynomials obtained using Algorithm- $\mathcal{D}$ .

Example 1. Let p be a 201-bit prime given below

$$p = 1606938044258990275541962092341162602522202993782792835301611$$

and n=18. Let  $\eta=3, \ \kappa=6$ . If we take d=3, we have  $k=\kappa/d=2$  and so the condition  $\gcd(\eta,k)=1$  is satisfied. Taking r=k, we get the following polynomials.

$$h(z) = z^3 + 15z^2 + 10z + 11$$

$$f(x) = x^9 + (12z^2 + 18z + 9)x^8 + (8355z^2 + 5364z + 6372)x^7$$

# 5 Asymptotic Run Times for the Medium Prime Case

The norm bounds given by Proposition 1 are the same as those obtained in [25]. Consequently, the calculations for the asymptotic complexity follows almost verbatim from the calculations in [25] and leads to the following result for the classical NFS.

+ (541504527394046900378336978445684610427996920133780742816963z + 315860038460594384818795094368482067510428549060075044498849)x + 479545464544939099588903417708754059417518495058229028032985z + 461243242085699950300079186153386681206871949929904822860464

Theorem 1. Let n = ηκ; d is a divisor of κ such that k = κ/d is co-prime to η; r ≥ k; t ≥ 2; p = LQ(a, cp) with 1/3 < a ≤ 2/3; and η = cη(ln Q/ln ln Q) 2/3−a . It is possible to ensure that the runtime of the exTNFS algorithm with polynomials chosen by Algorithm D is LQ(1/3, 2cb) where

$$c_b = \frac{2r+1}{3c_\theta kt} + \sqrt{\left(\frac{2r+1}{3c_\theta kt}\right)^2 + \frac{(t-1)kc_\theta}{3(r+1)}}$$
 and (10)

$$c_{\theta} = c_p c_{\eta}. \tag{11}$$

The best complexity of LQ(1/3,(48/9)1/<sup>3</sup> ) is achieved for c<sup>θ</sup> = 121/<sup>3</sup> , r = k = 1 and t = 2. The choice of r = k = 1 and t = 2 are not necessarily the best possible choices for other values of cθ.

For the case of multiple NFS we obtain a similar result.

Theorem 2. Let n = ηκ; d is a divisor of κ such that k = κ/d is co-prime to η; r ≥ k; t ≥ 2; p = LQ(a, cp) with 1/3 < a ≤ 2/3; and η = cη(ln Q/ln ln Q) 2/3−a . It is possible to ensure that the runtime of the exTNFS algorithm with polynomials chosen by Algorithm D is LQ(1/3, 2cb) where

$$c_b = \frac{4r+2}{6kc_\theta t} + \sqrt{\frac{r(3r+2)}{(3kc_\theta t)^2} + \frac{(t-1)kc_\theta}{3(r+1)}}$$
 and (12)

$$c_{\theta} = c_p c_{\eta}. \tag{13}$$

From Theorem 2, the entire analysis carried out in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 of [25] apply with the constant c<sup>p</sup> replaced by cθ. This leads to the new asymptotic complexity results for the medium prime case that has been mentioned in the introduction.

#### 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented a new polynomial selection method for the exTNFS algorithm. This method provides a generalisation of the Conjugation method in the setting of exTNFS proposed by Jeong and Kim [12]. For certain ranges of finite fields, the new method provides lower asymptotic complexity than the Conjugation method of Jeong and Kim.

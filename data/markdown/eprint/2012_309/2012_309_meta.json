    "abstract": "&#8233;Elliptic curve cryptosystems have improved greatly in speed over the past few years.  In this paper  we outline a new elliptic curve signature and key agreement implementation which achieves record speeds while remaining relatively compact.  For example, on Intel Sandy Bridge, a curve with about $2^{250}$ points produces a signature in just under 60k clock cycles, verifies in under 169k clock cycles, and computes a Diffie-Hellman shared secret in under 153k clock cycles.  Our implementation has a small footprint: the library is under 55kB.  We also post competitive timings on ARM processors, verifying a signature in under 626k Tegra-2 cycles.  We introduce faster field arithmetic, a new point compression algorithm, an improved fixed-base scalar multiplication algorithm and a new way to verify signatures without inversions or coordinate recovery.  Some of these improvements should be applicable to other systems.",

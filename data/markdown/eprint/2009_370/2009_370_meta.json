    "abstract": "This paper presents the first study of pairing computation on curves with embedding degree $15$. We compute the Ate and the twisted Ate pairing for a family of curves with parameter $\\rho~1.5$ and embedding degree $15$. We use a twist of degree 3 to perform most of the operations in $\\F_p$ or $\\F_{p^5}$. Furthermore, we present a new arithmetic for extension fields of degree $5$. Our computations show that these curves give very efficient implementations for pairing-based cryptography at high security levels.",

    "abstract": "Miyaji, Nakabayashi and Takano (MNT) gave families of group orders of ordinary elliptic curves with embedding degree suitable for pairing applications. In this paper we generalise their results by giving\nfamilies corresponding to non-prime group orders. We also consider the case of ordinary abelian varieties of dimension 2.  We give families of\ngroup orders with embedding degrees 5, 10 and 12.",

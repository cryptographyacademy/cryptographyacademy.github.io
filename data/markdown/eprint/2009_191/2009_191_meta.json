    "abstract": "A new technique for combinational circuit optimization\nis described in the context of S-boxes.\nThe technique is a two-step process. In\nthe first step, the non-linearity of the circuit -- as measured\nby the number of non-linear gates it contains -- is\nreduced. The second step reduces the number of gates in\nthe linear components of the already reduced circuit.\nThe technique can be applied to arbitrary circuits, and seems\nto yield improvements even on circuits that have\nalready been optimized by standard methods. We apply our technique\nto the S-box of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).\nThe result is, as far as we know, the\nsmallest circuit yet constructed for this function.",

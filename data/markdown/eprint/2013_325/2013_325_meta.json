    "abstract": "Censorship-circumvention tools are in an arms race against censors.\nThe censors study all traffic passing into and out of\ntheir controlled sphere,\nand try to disable censorship-circumvention tools\nwithout completely shutting down the Internet.\nTools aim to shape their traffic patterns to match unblocked programs,\nso that simple traffic profiling\ncannot identify the tools within a reasonable number of traces;\nthe censors respond by deploying firewalls\nwith increasingly sophisticated deep-packet inspection.\n\nCryptography hides patterns in user data\nbut does not evade censorship\nif the censor can recognize patterns in the cryptography itself.\nIn particular,\nelliptic-curve cryptography\noften transmits points on known elliptic curves,\nand those points are easily distinguishable from uniform random strings of bits.\n\nThis paper introduces high-security high-speed elliptic-curve systems\nin which elliptic-curve points are encoded so as to be indistinguishable\nfrom uniform random strings.\nAt a lower level,\nthis paper introduces a new bijection\nbetween strings and about half of all curve points;\nthis bijection is applicable to every odd-characteristic\nelliptic curve with a point of order 2,\nexcept for curves of j-invariant 1728.\nThis paper also presents guidelines to construct, and two examples of,\nsecure curves suitable for these encodings.",

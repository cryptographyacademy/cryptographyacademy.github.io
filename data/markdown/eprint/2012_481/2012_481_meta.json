    "abstract": "A $t$-round key alternating cipher can be viewed as an abstraction of AES. It defines a cipher $E$ from $t$ fixed public permutations $P_1, \\ldots, P_t : \\{0,1\\}^n \\ra \\{0,1\\}^n$ and a key $k = k_0\\Vert \\cdots \\Vert k_t \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n(t+1)}$ by setting $E_{k}(x) = k_t \\oplus P_t(k_{t-1} \\oplus P_{t-1}(\\cdots k_1 \\oplus P_1(k_0 \\oplus x) \\cdots))$. The indistinguishability of $E_k$ from a random truly random permutation by an adversary who also has oracle access to the (public) random permutations $P_1, \\ldots, P_t$ was investigated for $t = 2$ by Even and Mansour and, much later, by Bogdanov et al. The former proved indistinguishability up to $2^{n/2}$ queries for $t = 1$ while the latter proved indistinguishability up to $2^{2n/3}$ queries for $t \\geq 2$ (ignoring low-order terms). Our contribution is to improve the analysis of Bogdanov et al$.$ by showing security up to $2^{3n/4}$ queries for $t \\geq 3$.  Given that security cannot exceed $2^{\\frac{t}{t+1}n}$ queries, this is in particular achieves a tight bound for the case $t = 3$, whereas, previously, tight bounds had only been achieved for $t = 1$ (by Even and Mansour) and for $t = 2$ (by Bogdanov et al$.$).  Our main technique is an improved analysis of the elegant \\emph{sample distinguishability} game introduced by Bogdanov et al. More specifically, we succeed in eliminating adaptivity by considering the Hellinger advantage of an adversary, a notion that we introduce here. To our knowledge, our result constitutes the first time Hellinger distance (a standard measure of ``distance'' between random variables, and a cousin of statistical distance) is used in a cryptographic indistinguishability proof.",

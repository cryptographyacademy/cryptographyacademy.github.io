    "abstract": "We describe and analyze new combinations of multi-exponentiation\nalgorithms with  representations of the exponents.  We deal mainly but\nnot exclusively with the case where the inversion of group elements is fast: These methods are most attractive with exponents in the range from 80\nto 256 bits, and can also be used for computing single\nexponentiations in groups which admit an automorphism satisfying\na monic equation of small degree over the integers.\n\nThe choice of suitable exponent representations allows us to match or\nimprove the running time of the best multi-exponentiation techniques\nin the aforementioned range, while keeping the memory\nrequirements as small as possible.  Hence some of the methods\npresented here are particularly attractive for deployment in\nmemory constrained environments such as smart  cards.\nBy construction, such methods provide good resistance\nagainst side channel attacks.\n\nWe also describe some applications of these algorithms.",

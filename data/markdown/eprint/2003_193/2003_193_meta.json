    "abstract": "Universal Designated-Verifier Signature (UDVS) schemes are digital signature schemes with additional\nfunctionality which allows any holder of a signature to designate the signature to any desired\ndesignated-verifier such that the designated-verifier can verify that the message was signed by the\nsigner, but is unable to convince anyone else of this fact.\n\nSince UDVS schemes reduce to standard signatures when no verifier designation is performed, it is natural to ask\nhow to extend the classical Schnorr or RSA signature schemes into UDVS schemes, so that the existing key\ngeneration and signing implementation infrastructure for these schemes can be used without modification. We show\nhow this can be efficiently achieved, and provide proofs of security for our schemes in the random oracle model.",

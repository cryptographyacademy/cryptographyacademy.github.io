    "abstract": "In this short note, we present an extension of Nguyen's bilinear-map\nbased accumulator scheme to support\n\\emph{non-membership witnesses} and corresponding\n\\emph{non-membership proofs}, i.e., cryptographic proofs that an\nelement has not been accumulated to a given set. This complements\nthe non-membership proofs developed by Li \\emph{et\nal.} for the RSA\naccumulator, making the\nfunctionality of the bilinear-map accumulator equivalent to that of\nthe RSA accumulator. Our non-membership extension of Nguyen's\nscheme makes use of the $q$-Strong Diffie-Hellman\nassumption the security of the original scheme is based on.",

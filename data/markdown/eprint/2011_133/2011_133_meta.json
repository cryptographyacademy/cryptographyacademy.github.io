    "abstract": "At PKC 2010 Smart and Vercauteren presented a variant of\nGentry's fully homomorphic public key encryption scheme\nand mentioned that the scheme could support SIMD style\noperations.\nThe slow key generation process of the Smart--Vercauteren\nsystem was then addressed in a paper by Gentry and Halevi,\nbut their key generation method appears to exclude the SIMD\nstyle operation alluded to by Smart and Vercauteren.\nIn this paper, we show how to select parameters to\nenable such SIMD operations, whilst still maintaining\npracticality of the key generation technique of Gentry\nand Halevi.\nAs such, we obtain a somewhat homomorphic scheme supporting\nboth SIMD operations and operations on large finite fields\nof characteristic two.\nThis somewhat homomorphic scheme can be made fully\nhomomorphic in a naive way by recrypting all data elements\nseperately.  However, we show that the SIMD operations can be\nused to perform the recrypt procedure in parallel, resulting\nin a substantial speed-up.\nFinally, we demonstrate how such SIMD operations\ncan be used to perform various tasks by studying two use\ncases: implementing AES homomorphically and encrypted database\nlookup.",

    "abstract": "We provide a construction for a\ngroup signature scheme that is provably secure in a universally composable framework,\nwithin the standard model with trusted parameters.\nOur proposed  scheme is fairly simple and its efficiency falls\nwithin  small  factors of the most efficient group signature schemes\nwith provable security in any model (including random oracles).\nSecurity of our constructions require new\ncryptographic assumptions, namely the Strong LRSW, EDH, and Strong SXDH assumptions.  Evidence for any assumption we introduce is provided by proving hardness in the generic group model.\n\nOur second contribution is the first definition of security for group signatures based on the simulatability\nof real protocol executions in an ideal setting  that captures\nthe basic properties of unforgeability, anonymity, unlinkability, and exculpability for\ngroup signature schemes.",

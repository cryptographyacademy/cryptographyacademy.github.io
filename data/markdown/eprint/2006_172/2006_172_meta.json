    "abstract": "In many pairing-based protocols often the evaluation of the product\nof many pairing evaluations is required. In this paper we consider\nmethods to compute such products efficiently. Focusing on pairing-friendly fields\nin particular, we evaluate methods for the Weil, Tate and Ate pairing algorithms\nfor ordinary elliptic curves at various security levels. Our operation counts\nindicate that the minimal cost of each additional pairing relative to the cost of\none is $\\approx 0.61$, $0.45$, and $0.43$, for each of these pairings\nrespectively at the 128-bit security level.\nFor larger security levels the Ate pairing can have a relative\nadditional cost of as low as $0.13$ for each additional pairing.\n\nThese estimates allow implementors to make optimal algorithm choices for\ngiven scenarios, in which the number of pairings in the product,\nthe security level, and the embedding degree are\nfactors under consideration.",

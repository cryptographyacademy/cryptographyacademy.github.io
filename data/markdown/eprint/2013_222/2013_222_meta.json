    "abstract": "A $t$-round \\emph{key-alternating cipher} (also called \\emph{iterated\nEven-Mansour cipher}) can be viewed as an abstraction of AES.  It\ndefines a cipher $E$ from $t$ fixed public permutations $P_1, \\ldots,\nP_t : \\bits^n \\ra \\bits^n$ and a key $k = k_0\\Vert \\cdots \\Vert k_t\n\\in \\bits^{n(t+1)}$ by setting $E_{k}(x) = k_t \\oplus P_t(k_{t-1}\n\\oplus P_{t-1}(\\cdots k_1 \\oplus P_1(k_0 \\oplus x) \\cdots))$.  The\nindistinguishability of $E_k$ from a truly random permutation by an\nadversary who also has oracle access to the (public) random\npermutations $P_1, \\ldots, P_t$ was investigated in 1997 by Even and\nMansour for $t = 1$ and for higher values of $t$ in a series of recent\npapers.  For $t = 1$, Even and Mansour proved indistinguishability\nsecurity up to $2^{n/2}$ queries, which is tight.  Much later Bogdanov\net al$.$ (2011) conjectured that security should be $2^{\\frac{t}{t+1}n}$\nqueries for general $t$, which matches an easy distinguishing attack\n(so security cannot be more) .  A number of partial results have been\nobtained supporting this conjecture, besides Even and Mansour's\noriginal result for $t = 1$: Bogdanov et al$.$ proved security of\n$2^{\\frac{2}{3}n}$ for $t \\geq 2$, Steinberger (2012) proved security\nof $2^{\\frac{3}{4}n}$ for $t \\geq 3$, and Lampe, Patarin and Seurin\n(2012) proved security of $2^{\\frac{t}{t+2}n}$ for all even values of\n$t$, thus \"barely\" falling short of the desired\n$2^{\\frac{t}{t+1}n}$.\n\nOur contribution in this work is to prove the long-sought-for security\nbound of $2^{\\frac{t}{t+1}n}$, up to a constant multiplicative factor\ndepending on $t$. Our method is essentially an application of\nPatarin's H-coefficient technique.\nThe proof contains some coupling-like and inclusion-exclusion ideas,\nbut the main trick that pushes the computations through is\nto stick with the combinatorics and to\nrefrain from rounding any quantities too early.\nFor the reader's interest, we include a self-contained\ntutorial on the H-coefficient technique.",

    "abstract": "A key wrap algorithm is a secret key algorithm for the authenticated encryption of specialized data such as cryptographic keys.  Four key wrap algorithms have been proposed for the draft ASC X9 standard, ANS X9.102.  NIST is serving as the editor of ANS X9.102, and, on behalf of the X9F1 working group, NIST requests a cryptographic review of the four algorithms.  This document specifies the algorithms and suggests security models for their analysis.  Comments will be accepted until May 21, 2005.",

    "abstract": "We extend the torus-based compression technique for cyclotomic subgroups and show how the elements of certain subgroups in characteristic two and three fields can be compressed by a factor of 4 and 6, respectively. Our compression and decompression functions can be computed at a negligible cost. In particular, our techniques lead to very efficient exponentiation algorithms that work with the compressed representations of elements and can be easily incorporated into pairing-based protocols that require exponentiations or products of pairings.",

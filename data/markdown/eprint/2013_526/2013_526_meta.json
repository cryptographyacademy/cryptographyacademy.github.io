    "abstract": "This paper presents differential attacks of round-reduced versions of Simon with up to 18/32, 19/36, 25/44, 35/54, and 46/72 rounds\nfor the 32-, 48-, 64-, 96-, and 128-bit versions, respectively. Furthermore, we consider in brief related-key rectangle, impossible-differential, and also linear attacks. While all our attacks are completely academic, they demonstrate the drawback of the aggressive optimizations in Simon.",

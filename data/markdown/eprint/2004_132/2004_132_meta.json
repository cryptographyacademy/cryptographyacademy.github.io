    "abstract": "The output of the Tate pairing on an elliptic curve over a finite\nfield may be viewed as an element of an algebraic torus.\nUsing this simple observation, we transfer techniques recently\ndeveloped for torus-based cryptography to pairing-based cryptography,\nresulting in more efficient computations, and lower bandwidth\nrequirements. To illustrate the efficacy of this approach, we\napply the method to pairings on supersingular elliptic curves in\ncharacteristic three.",

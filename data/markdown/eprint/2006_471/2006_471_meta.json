    "abstract": "Pairing-friendly fields are finite fields that are suitable for the implementation of cryptographic bilinear pairings. In this paper we review multiplication and squaring methods for pairing-friendly fields $\\fpk$ with $k \\in \\{2,3,4,6\\}$. For composite $k$, we consider every possible towering construction. We compare the methods to determine which is most efficient based on the number of basic $\\fp$ operations, as well as the best constructions for these finite extension fields. We also present experimental results for every method.",

    "abstract": "Montgomery's trick is a technique which can be used to quickly compute multiple field inversion simultaneously. We extend this technique to simultaneous field divisions (that is, combinations of field multiplications and field inversion). The generalized Montgomery's trick is faster in some fields than a simple inversion with Montgomery's trick followed by a simple field multiplication",

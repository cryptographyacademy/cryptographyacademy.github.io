    "abstract": "Over a period of sixteen years elliptic curve cryptography went from being an approach that many people mistrusted or misunderstood to being a public key technology that enjoys almost unquestioned acceptance. We describe the sometimes surprising twists and turns in this paradigm shift, and compare this story with the commonly accepted Ideal Model\nof how research and development function in cryptography.  We also\ndiscuss to what extent the ideas in the literature on \"social\nconstruction of technology\" can contribute to a better understanding\nof this history.",

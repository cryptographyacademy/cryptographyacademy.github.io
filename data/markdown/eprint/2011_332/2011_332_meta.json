    "abstract": "New techniques for reducing the depth of circuits for cryptographic applications are described and applied to the AES S-box. These techniques also keep the number of gates quite small. The result, when applied to the AES S-box, is a circuit with depth 16 and only 128 gates. For the inverse, it is also depth 16 and has only 127 gates.\nThere is a shared middle part, common to both the S-box and its inverse, consisting of 63 gates.",

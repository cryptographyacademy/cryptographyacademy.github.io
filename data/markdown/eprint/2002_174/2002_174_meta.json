    "abstract": "A generic or KEM-DEM hybrid construction is a formal method of\ncombining a asymmetric and symmetric encryption techniques to give\nan efficient, provably secure public-key encryption scheme. This\nmethod combines an asymmetric KEM with a symmetric DEM, and each\nof these components must satisfy their own security conditions. In\nthis paper we describe generic constructions for provably secure\nKEMs based on lower level primitives such as one-way trapdoor\nfunctions and weak key-agreement protocols.",

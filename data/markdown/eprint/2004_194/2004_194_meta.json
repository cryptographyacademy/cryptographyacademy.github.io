    "abstract": "Recently Kurosawa and Desmedt\npresented a new hybrid encryption scheme which\nis secure against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack. Their scheme is a\nmodification of the Cramer-Shoup encryption scheme. Its major advantage with\nrespect to Cramer-Shoup is that it saves the computation of one exponentiation\nand produces shorter ciphertexts.\nHowever, the proof presented by Kurosawa and Desmedt relies on the use of\ninformation-theoretic key derivation and message authentication functions.\n\nIn this note we present a different proof of security\nwhich shows that the Kurosawa-Desmedt\nscheme can be instantiated with any computationally secure\nkey derivation and message authentication functions, thus extending\nthe applicability of their paradigm, and improving its efficiency.",

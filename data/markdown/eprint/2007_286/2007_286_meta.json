    "abstract": "Edwards recently introduced a new normal form for elliptic curves.\nEvery elliptic curve over a non-binary field\nis birationally equivalent to a curve in Edwards form\nover an extension of the field,\nand in many cases over the original field.\n\nThis paper presents fast\nexplicit formulas (and register allocations)\nfor group operations on an Edwards curve.\nThe algorithm for doubling\nuses only 3M+4S, i.e., 3 field multiplications and 4 field squarings.\n\nIf curve parameters are chosen to be small\nthen the algorithm for mixed addition uses only 9M+1S\nand the algorithm for non-mixed addition uses only 10M+1S\nArbitrary Edwards curves can be handled at the cost of just one extra\nmultiplication by a curve parameter.\n\nFor comparison,\nthe fastest algorithms known for the popular ``a_4=-3 Jacobian'' form\nuse 3M+5S for doubling;\nuse 7M+4S for mixed addition;\nuse 11M+5S for non-mixed addition;\nand use 10M+4S for non-mixed addition when one input has been added\nbefore.\n\nThe explicit formulas for non-mixed addition on an Edwards curve\ncan be used for doublings at no extra cost,\nsimplifying protection against side-channel attacks.\nEven better, many elliptic curves\n(approximately 1/4 of all isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over a non-binary finite field)\nare birationally equivalent---over the original field---to Edwards curves where\nthis addition algorithm works for all pairs of curve points,\nincluding inverses, the neutral element, etc.\n\nThis paper contains an\nextensive comparison of different forms of elliptic curves and\ndifferent coordinate systems for the basic group operations\n(doubling, mixed addition, non-mixed addition, and unified addition)\nas well as higher-level operations such as multi-scalar multiplication.",

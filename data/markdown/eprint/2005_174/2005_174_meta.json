    "abstract": "An increasingly important design constraint for software running on ubiquitous\ncomputing devices is security, particularly against physical methods such as\nside-channel attack.  One well studied methodology for defending against such\nattacks is the concept of indistinguishable functions which leak no\ninformation about program control flow since all execution paths are\ncomputationally identical.  However, the constructing such functions by hand\nis laborious and error prone as their complexity increases.  We investigate\ntechniques for automating this process and find that effective solutions can\nbe constructed with only minor amounts of computational effort.",

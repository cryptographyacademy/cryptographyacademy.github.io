    "abstract": "A common scenario in many pairing-based cryptographic protocols is that one argument in the pairing is &#64257;xed as a long term secret key or a constant parameter in the system. In these situations, the runtime of Miller’s algorithm can be signi&#64257;cantly reduced by storing precomputed values that depend on the &#64257;xed argument, prior to the input or existence of the second argument. In light of recent developments in pairing computation, we show that the computation of the Miller loop can be sped up by up to 37% if precomputation is employed, with our method being up to 19.5% faster than the previous precomputation  techniques.",

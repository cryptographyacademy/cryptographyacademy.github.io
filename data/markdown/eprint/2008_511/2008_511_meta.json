First, we classify all publicly known candidates and,\nsecond, we outline and summarize the performance data as given in the\ncandidates documentation for 64-bit and 32-bit implementations. We\ndefine performance classes and classify the hash algorithms. Note,\nthat this article will be updated as soon as new candidates arrive or\nnew cryptanalytic results get published. Comments to the authors of\nthis article are welcome.",

**Abstract.** In this note we give an overview on the current state of the SHA-3 candidates. First, we classify all publicly known candidates and, second, we outline and summarize the performance data as given in the candidates documentation for 64-bit and 32-bit implementations. We define performance classes and classify the hash algorithms. Note, that this article will be updated as soon as new candidates arrive or new cryptanalytic results get published. Comments to the authors of this article are welcome.

**Keywords:** hash function, SHA-3, classification.

### 1 Introduction

The design of secure and practical hash functions is of great interest since most practical hash functions, like MD5 [82], SHA-0 [78] or SHA-1 [76] have been broken. Due to the SHA-3 competition [75], many new proposals for hash function primitives have been submitted to become the new SHA-3 algorithm.

This article is organized as follows: In Section 2 we define criteria that we will use to classify the SHA-3 candidate algorithms. In Section 3 we give an overview of the software performance claimed by the algorithm's authors.

#### 2 Classification of the SHA-3 Candidates

We have defined in the following some attributes including characteristics that are used in our classification. Tables 1-2 show all SHA-3. The attribute characteristics "X" means that the SHA-3 candidate has the attribute and "-" that the SHA-3 candidate does not have it. The meaning of the other characteristics can be found in the following attribute description.

Feistel Network (FN)[88] A Feistel network is a general method of transforming any function (usually called an F-function) into a permutation. An F-function is always non-linear and almost always irreversible. The Feistel Network was invented by Horst Feistel. The FN attribut can have two characteristics.

#### Balanced Feistel Network (B)

A compression function is called a balanced feistel network, when

- 1. the internal state is divided into a left and right part of equal size n.
- 2. a message depended, nonlinear function F maps those parts to two output parts of the same length.

### Unbalanced feistel network (U)

A compression function is called an unbalanced feistel network is based on a feistel network where the internal state is divided into more resp. less then two parts or into two parts of unequal size.

### Wide Pipe design (WP) [58]

The internal state, i.e. chaining value, of the hash function is larger than the message digest.

#### Key Schedule (KEY)

The hash function has an explicit key schedule or a message expansion algorithm.

## MDS Matrix (MDS) [85]

One or more Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) matrices are used as a building block of the compression function. A MDS matrix has strong diffusion properties that can be exploited in certain cryptographic primitives. The characteristics is the size of the MDS Matrix in bytes. For exmaple, the characteristics "4 × 4" means that a "4 × 4" byte MDS matrix is used as a bulding block.

### Output Transformation (OUT)

Is a function with the"final" chaining value as input and the message digest as output. Trivial output transformation such as the identity or truncation does not count at all.

### S-box (SBOX)

The hash function uses one or more substitution boxes. In general a S-box is a non linear function that maps m input bits to n output bits. Usually, a S-box is implemented as lookup table. The characteristics is the S-bix size in bits.

### Feedback Shift Register (FSR)

The compression functions is/uses a (N)LFSRs. The input bits of a (non-)linear feedback shift register ((N)LFSR) are computed via a (non-)linear function from the previous state.

### Addition Rotation XOR (ARX)

The compression function contains addition, rotation and XOR operations with the purpose to destroy linearity.

### Boolean operations (BOOL)

The compression function contains basic operations of the boolean algebra. Characteristics are the boolean operation of the compression function.

### Collision Attack

The best known collision attack that is better than the birthday attack. The characteristic E means that a practical example for a collision exists.

### (Second) Preimage Attack

The best known (2nd) preimage attack that is better than then long second preimage attack [46]. The characteristic E means that a practical example for a (2nd) preimage exists.

# 3 Software Speed of the SHA-3 Candidates

In this section we give an overview of the claimed software performance of the public known SHA-3 candidates. We compare each candidate for their 32 and 64 bit performance. Therefore, we define five speed classes, which are listed in Table 4.

Tables 5-8 compare the SHA-3 candidates and their speed classes. As a reference algorithm we add SHA-256/ 512 [77]. Since each SHA-2 version is in class C for the 32 bit performance and in class B for the 64 bit performance, we think that this can be seen as a benchmark for all algorithms submitted. Nevertheless, there is a tradeoff between speed and security.

Table 4. Speed classification table.

One can easily design a hash function with a high level of security which is very slow and therefore may be useless in practice. For practical interest algorithms that are in speed class D or E will have a disadvantage for practical purpose, but they could possibly face a strong design. On the other side if an algorithm is very fast, i.e. in speed class AA, this could be a hint that the security margin is not chosen so high. Recent breaks of very fast hash functions, i.e. EnRUPT [79] or Boole [84], have verified this conjecture.

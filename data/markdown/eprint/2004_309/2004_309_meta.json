    "abstract": "This paper points out that, contrary to popular belief,\nallowing a message authentication adversary multiple verification attempts\ntowards forgery is NOT equivalent to allowing it a single one, so that\nthe notion of security that most message authentication schemes are proven to\nmeet does not guarantee their security in practice. We then show, however, that\nthe equivalence does hold for STRONG unforgeability. Based on this we\nrecover security of popular classes of message authentication schemes such as\nMACs (including HMAC and PRF-based MACs) and CW-schemes.  Furthermore, in many\ncases we do so with a TIGHT security reduction, so that in the end\nthe news we bring is surprisingly positive given the initial negative result.\nFinally, we show analogous results for authenticated encryption.",

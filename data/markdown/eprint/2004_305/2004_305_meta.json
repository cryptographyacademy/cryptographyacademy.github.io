    "abstract": "The cost of the folklore algorithm for computing cube roots in $\\F_{3^m}$ in standard polynomial basis is less that one multiplication, but still $O(m^2)$. Here we show that, if $\\F_{3^m}$ is represented in trinomial basis as $\\F_3[x]/(x^m + ax^k + b)$ with $a, b = \\pm 1$, the actual cost of computing cube roots in $\\F_{3^m}$ is only $O(m)$.",

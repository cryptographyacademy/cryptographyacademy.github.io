    "abstract": "In this paper we simplify and extend the Eta pairing, originally\ndiscovered in the setting of supersingular curves by Baretto et al.,\nto ordinary curves.  Furthermore, we show that by swapping the\narguments of the Eta pairing, one obtains a very efficient algorithm\nresulting in a speed-up of a factor of around six\nover the usual Tate pairing, in the case of curves\nwhich have large security parameters, complex multiplication\nby $D=-3$, and when the trace of Frobenius is chosen to be suitably small.\nOther, more minor savings are obtained for more general curves.",

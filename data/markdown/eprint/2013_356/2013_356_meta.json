    "abstract": "When a client outsources a job to a third party (e.g., the cloud), how\ncan the client check the result, without reexecuting the computation?\nRecent work in _proof-based verifiable computation_ has made\nsignificant progress on this problem by incorporating deep results from\ncomplexity theory and cryptography into built systems. However, these\nsystems work within a stateless model: they exclude computations that\ninteract with RAM or a disk, or for which the client does not have the\nfull input.\n\nThis paper describes Pantry, a built system that overcomes these\nlimitations.  Pantry composes proof-based verifiable computation with\nuntrusted storage: the client expresses its computation in terms of\ndigests that attest to state, and verifiably outsources _that_\ncomputation.  Using Pantry, we extend verifiability to MapReduce jobs,\nsimple database queries, and interactions with private state. Thus,\nPantry takes another step toward practical proof-based verifiable\ncomputation for realistic applications.",

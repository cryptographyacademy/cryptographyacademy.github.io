    "abstract": "In this note we consider the Shabal permutation function $\\mathcal{P}$ as a block cipher with input $A_p$,$B_p$ and key $C$,$M$ and describe a distinguisher with a data complexity of $2^{23}$ random inputs with a given difference.  If the attacker can control one chosen bit of $B_p$, only $2^{21}$ inputs with a given difference are required on average.  This distinguisher does not appear to lead directly to an attack on the full Shabal construction.",

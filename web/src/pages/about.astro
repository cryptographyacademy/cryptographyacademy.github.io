      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        cryptography.academy is an open knowledge base for
        cryptographic research literature. We process papers from the
        cryptographic research corpus, extract every definition,
        theorem, lemma, and formula, and cross-reference them across
        the entire body of literature. When Paper A cites a definition
        from Paper B, we link them. When two papers define the same
        concept differently, we surface it. When a proof relies on a
        property established elsewhere, we trace it back to its
        source.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Think of it as a compiler for cryptographic literature: just
        as a compiler checks that every reference in your code
        resolves correctly, cryptography.academy verifies that every
        reference in the research resolves, is consistent, and is
        traceable to its origin.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        The long-term goal is formal verification. Definitions and
        theorems extracted from papers are progressively formalized in
        Lean 4, building a machine-checked foundation for
        cryptographic knowledge &mdash; starting with
        zero-knowledge-proof-optimized primitives like Poseidon and
        the algebraic structures they depend on.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        No other tool operates at this level of granularity. Citation
        graphs link papers to papers. We link definitions to
        definitions, formulas to formulas, and proofs to the precise
        results they depend on &mdash; across the entire cryptographic
        literature.

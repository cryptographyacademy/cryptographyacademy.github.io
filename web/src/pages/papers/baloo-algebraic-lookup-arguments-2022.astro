      <p class="text-gray-300">We present Baloo, a protocol for lookup tables where the prover work is linear on the number of lookups and independent of the table size. Baloo is built over previous lookup arguments, and the framework for SNARKs from R&agrave;fols and Zapico (CRYPTO 21).
Our protocol supports commit-and-prove expansions: the prover selects the subtable containing the elements used in the lookup, that is unknown to the verifier, commits to it and later proves its relation with the committed elements. This feature makes Baloo especially suitable for proving input-output relations on hash functions, and in particular to instantiate the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">1 Introduction</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The rise of succinct proving systems in the recent decade has brought us close to one of the Holy Grails of computer science. Namely, being able to prove a large computation while spending not much more time on the proof than on the computation itself. We know how to make a proof only a handful of bytes large, and how to make the verifier run in a millisecond &ndash; but the prover time remains a bottleneck.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In recent years, there has been increasing focus on improving prover efficiency in cryptographic protocols. A key technique that has gained attention is the use of lookups table arguments, which allow heavy computations to be replaced by retrieving values from pre-defined tables, such as caches or databases.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In lookup table arguments, prover and verifier each have as input some representation of a table  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span>  and a vector  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span> , and the former aims to convince the latter that all elements of  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span>  are also present in  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span> . When this is the case, we say that  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span>  is a lookup on  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span> . In the settings we consider in this work, we have  <span class="math">\\vec{c} \\in \\mathbb{F}^N</span>  and  <span class="math">\\vec{a} \\in \\mathbb{F}^m</span> , with m &lt;&lt; N. We also assume that the table  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span>  is public, and its representation can be precomputed and reused in several prover-verifier interactions. For instance,  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span>  can contain all field elements within a range, or input-output pairs for some heavy public computation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This approach can significantly speed up certain operations, such as efficient regular  <span class="math">(2^n)</span>  integer arithmetic and bit-oriented algorithms, like modern hash functions. Until recently, the most efficient construction for proving lookups was Plookup [GW20], which constrained prover time to be linear in the size of the lookup table, N, limiting its use with</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">large tables. However, in 2022, a second breakthrough lead by Caulk <a href="#page-28-0">[ZBK</a><sup>+</sup>22, <a href="#page-27-0">PK22]</a> appears as the first method to prove <em>m</em> lookups in more reasonable <em>O</em>(<em>m</em><sup>2</sup> ) time, i.e. independent of <em>N</em>, after a pre-processing step of size <em>O</em>(<em>N</em> log <em>N</em>).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">At the same time, a number of computationally powerful blockchains, with Ethereum being the most prominent example, barely withstand the demand for a higher transaction rate and computational bandwidth. One bold attempt to get consensus on the computation without every node repeating work is to use a SNARK as a certificate of correctness. However, efforts to build a prover for Ethereum's virtual machine <a href="#page-23-0">[BBCCL21,</a> <a href="#page-25-0">Eth22,</a> <a href="#page-27-1">Pol22,</a> <a href="#page-28-1">Sta22,</a> <a href="#page-29-0">Zha22,</a> <a href="#page-29-1">zks22]</a> have been hindered by the cost of proving the Keccak hash function, even if a prover is lookup-enhanced. As Keccak is used in the Merkle tree of the blockchain state, a proof for all state transitions in one block results in tens of millions of lookups &mdash; an amount insurmountable by Caulk.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Baloo is the first lookup argument to prove <em>m</em> lookups in quasi-linear time. It is tailored to prime fields suitable for KZG commitments and opening proofs <a href="#page-27-2">[KZG10]</a>, which are around 256-bit large, and thus to computations defined on such domains. The prover complexity is quasi-linear in the field and linear in the group. This is thanks to a number of new techniques designed around proving statements over sets that are not multiplicative subgroups (where we cannot use Fast Fourier Transforms).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Fig. <a href="#page-2-0">1</a> we compare the concrete costs of the closest schemes to this work (that is, use univariate polynomials and are pairing-based), when compiled using the KZG polynomial commitment scheme <a href="#page-27-2">[KZG10]</a>. Plookup <a href="#page-26-0">[GW20]</a> and Halo2 <a href="#page-24-0">[BGH19]</a> require no preprocessing but the prover work in the group is quasi-linear in the size of the table. They can be compiled using any polynomial commitment scheme including solutions that do not require pairings. Caulk <a href="#page-28-0">[ZBK</a><sup>+</sup>22] introduced the first solution with prover work that is sublinear in the size of the table by using preprocessing, but they incur a quadratic cost in the number of lookups. Posen and Kattis introduced Caulk+<a href="#page-27-0">[PK22]</a>, an improvement over Caulk that leads to a table-independent prover, still quadratic on number of lookups. Flookup <a href="#page-26-1">[GK22]</a> reduced the prover complexity to quasi-linear on the lookups while retaining a table-independent prover. However, their techniques rely on committing to a table as roots of a polynomial instead of coefficients. This means their commitments are not homomorphic, which limits the applicability of their solution to stand-alone set membership proofs and makes it challenging to use their lookup to speed up SNARK provers (see Section <a href="#page-34-0">C)</a>. We discuss concurrent and follow-up work at the end of this section.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We provide an implementation of Ba<em>loo</em> and compare its performance with those protocols that have publicly available implementations in Appendix <a href="#page-36-0">D.</a></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Other approaches, such as discrete-log based <a href="#page-24-1">[BG13,</a> <a href="#page-26-2">GK15,</a> <a href="#page-23-1">BCC</a><sup>+</sup>15, <a href="#page-24-2">BCG</a><sup>+</sup>18] require no trusted setup but incur a linear verifier. Bootle et al. <a href="#page-24-2">[BCG</a><sup>+</sup>18] initially suggested the use of lookup arguments to improve the prover time in proving machine computations. Their solution targetted the TinyRAM virtual machine <a href="#page-23-2">[BCG</a><sup>+</sup>13]. Campanelli et al. <a href="#page-25-1">[CFH</a><sup>+</sup>22] present also a scheme for position-hiding linkability of RSA accumulators for large prime numbers and Pedersen commitments. Concretely they achieve good efficiency: their proof size is constant and their proving times do not depend on the size of the accumulator. Further, they can support larger lookup tables than Ba<em>loo</em> because they are not constrained by the size of their setup. However, their scheme crucially relies on groups of hidden order such as a trusted RSA modulus or class groups.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Lookup arguments are often used in the context of key-value lookups in verifiable registries <a href="#page-24-3">[CDGM19]</a>. Multiple works <a href="#page-28-2">[TBP</a><sup>+</sup>19, <a href="#page-27-3">MKL</a><sup>+</sup>20, <a href="#page-27-4">HHK</a><sup>+</sup>21, <a href="#page-28-3">TFBT21]</a> explore how to ensure the correctness of the table that is used in verifiable registries.

    <p class="text-gray-300">al. [CEO22] demonstrate how homomorphic commitments can be used to build key-value lookups. Their solution is zero-knowledge, does not require a trusted setup or pairings, and uses techniques similar to Section C. However, their prover work is linear on the size of the table. Agrawal and Raghuraman [AR20] build key-value lookups using hidden order groups. Campanelli et al. [CFG <span class="math">^+</span> 20] use lookup arguments to construct <em>verifiable decentralized storage</em> and achieve a sublinear prover assuming preprocessing. Benarroch et al. [BCF <span class="math">^+</span> 21] discuss commit-and-prove set membership proofs, which is a useful primitive for constructing modular zero-knowledge proofs.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Concurrent and follow-up work. Eagen et al. [EFG22] introduce cq, a lookup argument where prover work is O(m) in the group and  <span class="math">O(m\\log m)</span>  in the field, for m lookups on tables of any size N. To prove that for a table  <span class="math">\\vec{c} \\in \\mathbb{F}^N</span>  and vector  <span class="math">\\vec{a} \\in \\mathbb{F}^m</span> , it is true that all the elements in  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span>  are also in  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span> , Baloo creates an intermediate shorter table  <span class="math">\\vec{t} \\in \\mathbb{F}^k</span>  with  <span class="math">k \\leq N</span>  such that  <span class="math">\\vec{t}</span>  has all the elements in  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span>  that are used in  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span> . That is, our first step is to get rid of the unused elements in  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span> . The main novelty in [EFG22], and follow-up work [PH23, CFF<sup>+</sup>24], is to use a property of logarithmic derivatives exploited in [Hab22] that allows to link directly the initial table  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span>  with the lookup  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span> , with prover work independent of  <span class="math">|\\vec{c}|</span> . On the downside, the commitments to vectors  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span> , and  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span>  are not homomorphic. Baloo is, to the best of our knowledge, the most efficient lookup argument with homomorphic commitments that uses a univariate setup.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Roughly speaking, the techniques of cq are related to the ones used to prove the permutation argument in Plonk [GWC19]. In contrast, the ones of this work are based on a novel analysis of an argument for simple linear relations of [RZ21], which was designed as a plug-in for the Marlin proof system [CHM<sup>+</sup>20]. The core technical part of this work is to use techniques developed in the context of the Marlin proof system, namely, Checkable Subspace Sampling (CSS) arguments, to show that a vector  <span class="math">\\vec{d}</span>  is in the row space of some public matrix  <span class="math">\\mathbf{M}</span>  and use them in another context where  <span class="math">\\mathbf{M}</span>  is unknown. Therefore, our work presents a new technique, a stronger analysis of Marlin-like sparse polynomial commitments.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The essence of Baloo is the observation that, to prove the lookup relation between  <span class="math">\\vec{t}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span>  it is enough to prove the existence of a matrix  <span class="math">\\mathbf{M} \\in \\mathbb{F}^{m \\times k}</span>  such that (i)  <span class="math">\\mathbf{M}\\vec{t} = \\vec{a}</span> , and (ii) the rows of  <span class="math">\\mathbf{M}</span>  are unit vectors and so,  <span class="math">\\mathbf{M}</span>  is what we define as a lookup matrix. Proving matrix-vector products is a problem that arises in the design of SNARKs for R1CS arithmetization [BCR<sup>+</sup>19, CHM<sup>+</sup>20, CFF<sup>+</sup>21, Set20, RZ21]. Baloo's characterization of a lookup argument has opened a line of research where SNARK techniques can be exploited. Setty et al. proposed in Lasso [STW24] the first completely linear-time lookup building on multivariate polynomial commitments. The authors follow the same approach of committing to the (secret) matrix that relates  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\vec{t}</span>  proposed in this work, but upholding</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">_{\\rm Ba}</span> loo</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">the techniques in Spartan [Set20]. A significant contribution of Lasso [STW24] and the companion paper [AST24] is the observation that many tables in practice are structured tables. Roughly speaking, this means that the lookup operation can be reconstructed by different lookups in smaller tables. This allows to handle much bigger tables than previous works. As pointed out in [STW24], to use proof systems that use KZG commitments [KZG10], Lasso needs an additional argument to link them with multivariate commitments, whereas Baloo natively supports them. Recently, Garreta and Manzur [GM24] introduced FLI, a folding scheme for lookup instances built over Baloo and the folding scheme for R1CS presented in [KST22].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is natural to ask how Baloo can be used for lookup arguments over witnesses defined on smaller domains. Natural examples include 64-bit proof systems such as Plonky2 [PZ22] and a family of hash functions [GKL<sup>+</sup>22, SLST23, Sal23] recently introduced to speed up such proof systems. This question was addressed for the multivariate case, building on Lasso, in a recent work [DP25], and we leave the extension to the univariate case for future work.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-3.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.2 Lagrange Polynomials</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Given a vector  <span class="math">\\vec{v} \\in \\mathbb{F}^d</span>  and a basis  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B} = \\{B_i(X)\\}_{i=1}^d</span>  of the polynomials of degree d-1, we can represent vector v as a polynomial  <span class="math">v(X) = \\sum_{i=1}^d v_i B_i(X)</span> . We call such a representation an <em>encoding</em> of  <span class="math">\\vec{v}</span> , and omit reference to the basis when possible.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Along this work, we will set  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}</span>  to be the basis of Lagrange interpolation polynomials for some set S of size d. We recall the Lagrange basis with respect to a set  <span class="math">S=(s_1,\\ldots,s_d)</span>  consists of d polynomials  <span class="math">p_i(X)</span>  of degree d-1 such that  <span class="math">p_i(s_i)=1</span>  and  <span class="math">p_i(s_j)=0</span>  when  <span class="math">i\\neq j</span> . The vanishing polynomial  <span class="math">z_S(X)</span>  is the polynomial that takes value 0 in all the elements of S, i.e.,  <span class="math">z_S(X)=\\prod_{s_i\\in S}(X-s_i)</span> . For any set of Lagrange interpolation polynomials  <span class="math">\\{p_i(X)\\}_{i=1}^d</span>  it is true that  <span class="math">\\sum_{i=1}^d p_i(X)=1</span> ,  <span class="math">z_S(X)|p_i(X)p_j(X)</span>  for  <span class="math">i\\neq j</span> , and since  <span class="math">p_i^2(X)=p_i(X)(1-\\sum_{j\\neq i}p_j(X))</span> , it always hold that  <span class="math">p_i^2(X)\\equiv p_i(X)\\mod z_S(X)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We will work with three different sets and their corresponding Lagrange interpolation basis in order to encode vectors of three different sizes:  <span class="math">\\mathbb{H}</span>  of size N,  <span class="math">\\mathbb{V}</span>  of size m, and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{H}_I</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">of size k. If possible, we choose the set S to be a set of roots of unity in the field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span> , as this choice leads to sparse representations for both Lagrange and vanishing polynomials. For a vector of size N, we assume without loss of generality that there exists a primitive Nth root of unity  <span class="math">\\omega^1</span> . We define the subgroup  <span class="math">\\mathbb{H} = \\{\\omega, \\omega^2, \\dots, \\omega^{N-1}, 1\\} \\subset \\mathbb{F}</span> . The Lagrange interpolation polynomials for this set are denoted as  <span class="math">\\{\\lambda_s(X)\\}_{s=1}^N</span> , and the vanishing polynomial is  <span class="math">z_H(X)</span> . Since  <span class="math">\\mathbb{H}</span>  is a subgroup, the Lagrange polynomial  <span class="math">\\lambda_s(X)</span>  can be expressed as  <span class="math">\\lambda_s(X) = \\frac{\\omega^s}{N} \\frac{X^N - 1}{X - \\omega^s}</span> , and the vanishing polynomial is  <span class="math">z_H(X) = X^N - 1</span> . For vectors of size m ( <span class="math">m \\neq N</span> ) we assume  <span class="math">\\nu</span>  is a primitive mth root of unity, and we define the set  <span class="math">\\mathbb{V} = \\{\\nu, \\nu^2, \\dots, \\nu^m\\}</span> . The Lagrange interpolation polynomials for this set are denoted as  <span class="math">\\{\\mu_j(X)\\}_{j=1}^m</span> , and the vanishing polynomial is  <span class="math">z_V(X)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, we consider vectors of size k, which are constructed as subvectors of a vector of size N. To do this, we define  <span class="math">I \\subset [N]</span>  with |I| = k, and we set  <span class="math">\\mathbb{H}_I \\subset \\mathbb{H}</span>  such that  <span class="math">\\mathbb{H}_I = \\{\\omega^s \\mid s \\in I\\}</span> , maintaining the same order as in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{H}</span> . For simplicity, we rename the elements in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{H}_I</span>  and denote them as  <span class="math">\\mathbb{H}_I = \\{\\xi_i\\}_{i=1}^k</span> , where  <span class="math">\\xi_i = \\omega^s</span>  for the ith index  <span class="math">s \\in I</span> . The Lagrange polynomials for this set are denoted as  <span class="math">\\{\\tau_i(X)\\}_{i=1}^k</span> , and the vanishing polynomial is  <span class="math">z_I(X)</span> . Note that  <span class="math">\\mathbb{H}_I</span>  is generally not a subgroup and thus  <span class="math">z_I(X)</span>  and the  <span class="math">\\tau_i(X)</span> 's are not sparse.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The security of our protocols holds in the Algebraic Group Model (AGM) of Fuchsbauer et al. [FKL18], using the bilinear version of the q-dlog and q-sfrac assumptions [GG17, BB04] defined below. In the AGM, adversaries are restricted to be algebraic algorithms, namely, whenever  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span>  outputs a group element [y] in a cyclic group  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}</span>  of order p, it also outputs its representation as a linear combination of all previously received group elements. In other words, if  <span class="math">[y] \\leftarrow \\mathcal{A}([x_1], \\ldots, [x_m])</span> ,  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span>  must also provide  <span class="math">\\vec{z}</span>  such that  <span class="math">[y] = \\sum_{j=1}^m z_j[x_j]</span> . This definition generalizes naturally in asymmetric bilinear groups with a pairing  <span class="math">e: \\mathbb{G}_1 \\times \\mathbb{G}_2 \\to \\mathbb{G}_T</span> , where for  <span class="math">i \\in 1, 2</span> , the adversary must construct  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_i</span>  elements as linear combinations of received  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_i</span>  elements.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">4 Overview</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we provide a technical overview of the Baloo protocol, which proves a committed lookup relation, informally:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Given element  <span class="math">\\mathsf{cm}_{\\mathsf{a}} \\in \\mathbb{G}_1</span>  and a public set represented as vector  <span class="math">\\vec{c} \\in \\mathbb{F}^N</span> , there exists  <span class="math">\\vec{a} \\in \\mathbb{F}^m</span>  such that all elements of  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span>  are elements of  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathsf{cm}_{\\mathsf{a}}</span>  is a KZG commitment to  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To give an intuition of our protocol, we will first analyze the relation above in algebraic terms: given a public table represented in vector  <span class="math">\\vec{c} \\in \\mathbb{F}^N</span>  and a vector  <span class="math">\\vec{a} \\in \\mathbb{F}^m</span> , prove that for all  <span class="math">j \\in [m]</span> , there exists  <span class="math">s \\in [N]</span>  such that  <span class="math">a_j = c_s</span> . The first observation made also in previous work ([ZBK+22], [PK22]) is that as not all elements of  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span>  are used in  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span> , we can create a new, shorter table  <span class="math">\\vec{t}</span>  by selecting from  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span>  only those elements that are also in  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span> . This step is to prevent the prover from an unnecessary dependency on N.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Secondly, we prove that  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span>  is a result of some expansion of  <span class="math">\\vec{t}</span> , i.e., we design a lookup argument for  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span>  in the new table  <span class="math">\\vec{t}</span> . The hurdle of this step is that  <span class="math">\\vec{t}</span>  is unknown to the verifier and is encoded as a polynomial with an unknown Lagrange basis  <span class="math">\\{\\tau_i(X)\\}_{i=1}^k</span> . Designing an efficient lookup argument for such a table is our main contribution. To do so, we note that the relation above has a simple algebraic representation: as  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span>  is a vector generated using elements of  <span class="math">\\vec{t}</span> , there exists a matrix  <span class="math">\\mathbf{M} \\in \\mathbb{F}^{m \\times k}</span>  whose rows are unit vectors such that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">
<span class="math">$\\mathbf{M}\\vec{t} = \\vec{a}.\\tag{1}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Concretely, all elements in <strong>M</strong> are zero except for one element per row  <span class="math">1 = m_{j,i}</span>  when j, i are such that  <span class="math">a_i = t_i</span> . Recall we call such a matrix a <em>lookup matrix</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Figure 1, we depict the relations we aim to prove:  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span>  is the original table.  <span class="math">\\vec{t}</span>  is a subvector of it: it keeps the ordering of the elements in  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span> , and takes some of them only</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">once. On the other hand,  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span>  is itself a lookup on  <span class="math">\\vec{t}</span> : all elements of  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span>  are taken from  <span class="math">\\vec{t}</span> , in no strict order and with potential repetitions.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">    <img src="_page_8_Figure_2.jpeg" alt="" class="my-4 max-w-full" />
</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Relation between  <span class="math">\\vec{t}</span> ,  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span> , and  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To prove equation (1) and that <strong>M</strong> is a lookup matrix, we leverage SNARK techniques where proving linear relations is done via a lincheck argument, e.g. [BCR<sup>+</sup>19]. In particular, we use the framework of R&agrave;fols and Zapico [RZ21], that separates the lincheck into two parts: a Checkable Subspace Sampling (CSS) argument, and an inner product.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The CSS is a PHP that deals with the problem of committing to a matrix of size  <span class="math">m \\times k</span>  in a succinct way. The solution, adopted in other works ([CHM+20], [CFF+21]), is to sample a vector in the row-space of matrix  <span class="math">\\mathbf{M}</span>  and then commit to such vector. If the new vector is sampled using random coins chosen by the verifier, the linear relation can be reduced to proving the following inner product (with overwhelming probability):</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(\\vec{r}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{M}) \\cdot \\vec{t} = \\vec{r}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\vec{a}. \\tag{2}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, to prove M is of the correct form, we adapt the construction of [RZ21] to prove that a matrix has one non-zero element per column, so it works for lookup matrices.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Overall, to build Baloo and prove the committed relation defined at the beginning of this section, we first use a succinct argument from [PK22] to prove an element  <span class="math">\\mathsf{cm}_t</span>  is the commitment to a subvector of the vector committed in  <span class="math">\\mathsf{cm}_c</span> , introduced in Section 5.1. Then, we design a PHP for proving  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span>  is an expansion of vector  <span class="math">\\vec{t}</span> , in Section 5.2 and compile it into a succinct argument in Section 6.1. Finally, we put all the building blocks together and present the full Baloo construction with optimizations in 6.2.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-4.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.1 Select a subvector</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We denote by  <span class="math">\\mathsf{cm}_\\mathsf{c}</span>  the commitment to  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span> . Then we create a commitment  <span class="math">\\mathsf{cm}_\\mathsf{t}</span>  to a subvector  <span class="math">\\vec{t} \\in \\mathbb{F}^k</span>  defined by  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span>  through the set of index  <span class="math">I = \\{s \\in [N] \\text{ s.t. } \\exists a_j \\text{ with } c_s = a_j\\}</span> . That is,  <span class="math">\\vec{t}</span>  is the subvector of  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span>  that contains only the elements of  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span>  that are also in  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span> , i.e.,  <span class="math">\\vec{t} = (c_s)_{s \\in I}</span> . Recall that Since I is unknown to the verifier, we cannot use directly the subvector protocol in Section 3.5.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Instead, to prove that  <span class="math">\\mathsf{cm}_t</span>  commits to a subvector of  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span> , the prover provides  <span class="math">W_1 \\in \\mathbb{G}_1, [z_I]_2</span>  such that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$e(\\mathsf{cm}_{\\mathsf{c}} - \\mathsf{cm}_{\\mathsf{t}}, [1]_2) = e(W_1, [z_I]_2),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">along with a proof of well-formedness of  <span class="math">[z_I]_2</span> . That is, a proof that  <span class="math">[z_I]_2</span>  is a commitment to the vanishing polynomial of <em>some</em> subset of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{H}</span> . For proving the latter, we use the Caulk+ core protocol by [PK22] described in Section 5.1. If the prover has access to precomputed KZG proofs  <span class="math">\\{[Q_s]_1\\}_{s=1}^N</span>  of opening for all the elements  <span class="math">c_s \\in \\vec{c}</span>  and individual proofs  <span class="math">\\{[H_s]_1\\}_{s=1}^N</span>  of statements &quot; <span class="math">(X-\\omega^s)|z_H(X)</span> &quot;, it performs only  <span class="math">O(|\\vec{t}|)</span>  group operations to convince the verifier that  <span class="math">cm_t</span>  is a commitment to some subvector of  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span> .</p>

      <h3 id="sec-4.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.2 PHP for expansion</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our Checkable Subspace Sampling, that is a PHP for a special sampling relation, can be seen as a partial evaluation problem: given matrix  <span class="math">\\mathbf{M} \\in \\mathbb{F}^{m \\times k}</span> , sets  <span class="math">\\mathbb{H}_I</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{V}</span>  of size k</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and m with Lagrange interpolation polynomials  <span class="math">\\{\\tau_i(X)\\}_{i=1}^k</span>  and  <span class="math">\\{\\mu_j(X)\\}_{j=1}^m</span>  respectively, we can construct a bivariate polynomial encoding matrix  <span class="math">\\mathbf{M}</span>  as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">
<span class="math">$M(X,Y) = (\\mu_1(Y), \\dots, \\mu_m(Y)) \\mathbf{M} (\\tau_1(X) \\dots \\tau_k(X))^{\\top}</span>$
(3)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Then, the goal of a CSS argument is to show that for some  <span class="math">\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{F}</span>  sent by the verifier,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$D(X) = M(X, \\alpha) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} M_{ji} \\tau_i(X) \\mu_j(\\alpha).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">That is, D(X) is an encoding for  <span class="math">\\vec{d} = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\mu_j(\\alpha) \\vec{m}_j</span> , where  <span class="math">\\vec{m}_j</span>  are the row vectors of  <span class="math">\\mathbf{M}</span> . Performing a CSS argument allows to reduce the statement in eq. (1) to a single inner product relation  <span class="math">\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{t} = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} a_j \\mu_j(\\alpha)</span> , that can be proven with the univariate sumcheck [BCR<sup>+</sup>19].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We solve many challenges when using the framework in [RZ21]:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>The indexer. The framework is built to work for a public matrix  <span class="math">\\mathbf{M}</span>  and secret  <span class="math">\\vec{t}, \\vec{a}</span> . Because in our case matrix  <span class="math">\\mathbf{M}</span>  is only known by the prover, we replace the offline phase performed by the indexer in the CSS with a commitment phase performed by the prover itself. To support our protocol, we give a new definition of Commitand-Prove CSS which works for matrices that are chosen in a commit-and-prove fashion [CFQ19], that is, the prover selects matrix  <span class="math">\\mathbf{M}</span> , communicates it to the verifier in a succinct manner and then convinces them that  <span class="math">\\mathbf{M}\\vec{t} = \\vec{a}</span> .</li>
      <li>Matrix M. To prove the lookup relation between  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\vec{t}</span> , the prover must convince the verifier that matrix M is a lookup matrix, i.e., that its rows are unit vectors. For this, we adapt a construction of CSS given in [RZ21] for so-called <em>basic matrices</em> to work for lookup matrices. A basic matrix is a matrix with one non-zero element per column, while a lookup matrix has only one non-zero element per row.</li>
      <li>Inner Product. To complete the proof for the linear relation, in Section 5.2.4 we present a scheme for proving the inner product relation between  <span class="math">\\vec{d}</span>  as described above and table  <span class="math">\\vec{t}</span> , from its encodings D(X) and T(X). Both T(X) and D(X) can be naturally written in the Lagrange basis  <span class="math">\\{\\tau_i(X)\\}_{i=1}^k</span>  corresponding to set  <span class="math">\\mathbb{H}_I</span> , and we build the argument from the encoding using the generalized univariate sumcheck in Section 3.7.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We summarize the statement to be proven and challenges of building an argument for it in Fig. 2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we present the building blocks of Baloo. In Section 5.1, we describe the Caulk+ core protocol that lets the prover convince the verifier that a group element  <span class="math">\\mathsf{cm}_\\mathsf{t}</span>  is a commitment to a subvector of a public table  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span> , by performing  <span class="math">O(|\\vec{t}|)</span>  operations. In Section 5.2 we introduce the expansion argument that proves the committed lookup relation between  <span class="math">\\mathsf{cm}_\\mathsf{t}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathsf{cm}_\\mathsf{a}</span> . This expansion argument consists of a CSS scheme introduced in Section 5.2.3 and the inner product described in Section 5.2.4.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we introduce the building blocks of a PHP (Definition 4) that proves vector  <span class="math">\\vec{a}</span>  encoded in a polynomial A(X) is an expansion of the vector  <span class="math">\\vec{t}</span>  encoded in a polynomial T(X), which means that for all  <span class="math">j \\in [m]</span>  there exists  <span class="math">i \\in [k]</span>  such that  <span class="math">a_j = t_i</span> . Our PHP uses two main components: (i) a checkable subspace sampling argument and (ii) an inner product argument.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Designing (i) is the main technical contribution of this work, and there are several challenges sorted in order to achieve a CSS for a lookup matrix. We divide the presentation of such protocol in three parts: In Section 5.2.1 we introduce the definition of a Commitand-Prove CSS, after discussing its need. In section 5.2.2, we introduce the relation prover and verifier will run the proving phase for, and introduce the final CSS for it in 5.2.3. In Section 5.2.4 we describe the PHP for inner product relations we will use. All these schemes are compiled into a succinct argument in Section 6.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;3</sup>In previous works, these commitments were sent by the indexer. Our analysis shows that the technique works when these commitments are potentially adversarially chosen.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-5.2.1" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>5.2.1 Commit-and-Prove Checkable Subspace Sampling</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The first step for proving the relation between <em>&#8407;t</em> and <em>&#8407;a</em> through polynomial encodings is that the prover and the verifier agree on a polynomial <em>D</em>(<em>X</em>) encoding a uniformly sampled element in the row space of matrix <strong>M</strong> such that <strong>M***&#8407;t* = <em>&#8407;a</em>. That is, that <em>D</em>(<em>X</em>) is a random linear combination of polynomials <em>M&#8407;</em> (<em>X</em>) = (<em>M</em>1(<em>X</em>)<em>, . . . , Mm</em>(<em>X</em>))<sup>&#8868;</sup> that are encodings of the rows <em>&#8407;m<sup>i</sup></em> of **M</strong>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Naturally, we do not want the verifier to have to read <strong>M</strong> and thus they need to receive a succinct representation of it. In many SNARK constructions (<a href="#page-25-5">[CHM</a><sup>+</sup>20], <a href="#page-24-6">[CFF</a><sup>+</sup>21], <a href="#page-27-6">[RZ21]</a>) where matrix <strong>M</strong> is public before the interaction, such a representation is given during an offline phase of the CSS by a trusted party, called the indexer. We take a similar approach but, since matrix <strong>M</strong> is not part of the instance, we present a variant of CSS schemes where we ask the prover to provide the succinct representation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We call this variant a commit-and-prove CSS, where instead of having an indexer that in an offline phase computes polynomials describing the matrix, we have that the prover commits to a matrix and then proves attributes of it. More concretely, <em>&#8407;a</em> is an <em>expansion</em> of <em>&#8407;t</em> if and only if <strong>M</strong> is a matrix that has unit vectors in its rows, that is, there exists only one non-zero element in each row of <strong>M</strong> and it equals 1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In our commit-and-prove CSS, the prover and verifier first engage in a commit and sampling phase, during which they jointly agree on the statement being proven. This statement is described in Section <a href="#page-13-1">5.2.2.</a> Afterwards the prover and verifier engage in a proving phase where the prover demonstrates that the statement is correct (Section <a href="#page-13-0">5.2.3)</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 8</strong> (Commit-and-Prove CSS)<strong>.</strong> A commit-and-prove checkable subspace sampling argument over a field F, is a tuple of PPT algorithms (PCSS<em>,</em> VCSS) that defines <em>k, m</em> &isin; N, a set of allowed vectors of polynomials M(<em>X</em>), a coinspace C, a sampling function Smp : C &rarr; F <em><sup>m</sup></em> and runs in four different stages:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The commit and prove lookup takes as input commitments  <span class="math">\\mathsf{cm}_\\mathsf{t}</span> ,  <span class="math">\\mathsf{cm}_\\mathsf{a}</span>  to vectors  <span class="math">\\vec{t} \\in \\mathbb{F}^k</span> ,  <span class="math">\\vec{a} \\in \\mathbb{F}^m</span>  encoded as polynomials T(X), A(X). It also takes as input  <span class="math">[z_I]_2</span>  a commitment to the vanishing polynomial respect to a set  <span class="math">\\mathbb{H}_I = \\{\\xi_1, \\dots, \\xi_k\\}</span> . The polynomial T(X) is computed using the Lagrange interpolation basis  <span class="math">\\{\\tau_i(X)\\}_{i=1}^k</span>  corresponding to set  <span class="math">\\mathbb{H}_I</span> . The polynomial A(X) is computed using the Lagrange interpolation basis  <span class="math">\\{\\mu_j(X)\\}_{j=1}^m</span>  corresponding to subgroup  <span class="math">\\mathbb{V} = \\{\\nu, \\dots, \\nu^m = 1\\}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The prover aims to convince the verifier that there exists some mapping col:  <span class="math">[m] \\mapsto [k]</span>  such that  <span class="math">a_j = t_{\\mathsf{col}(j)}</span>  for all  <span class="math">j \\in [m]</span> . The prover and verifier use as subroutine the CSS from Fig. 4 to agree on an encoding D(X) such that for  <span class="math">\\hat{\\tau}_i(X) = (\\tau_i(X))/(\\tau_i(0))</span> ,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$D(X) = \\sum\\nolimits_{j=1}^m \\mu_j(\\alpha) \\hat{\\tau}_{\\mathsf{col}(j)}(X)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">at a random point  <span class="math">\\alpha</span> . Then the prover and verifier engage in the generalised inner product argument from Fig. 5 so show that, if  <span class="math">d_i = D(\\xi_i)\\tau_i(0)</span> , and  <span class="math">T(\\xi_i) = t_i</span> , then  <span class="math">\\sum_{i=1}^k d_i t_i = A(\\alpha)</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$A(\\alpha) = \\sum_{i=1}^k d_i t_i = \\sum_{i=1}^k t_i \\sum_{j \\in \\mathsf{col}^{-1}(i)} \\mu_j(\\alpha) = \\sum_{j=1}^m \\mu_j(\\alpha) t_{\\mathsf{col}(j)}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">we thus have that  <span class="math">a_j = A(\\nu_j) = t_{\\mathsf{col}(j)}</span>  with overwhelming probability, as required.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Recall that this protocol is a subroutine of Baloo in Fig. 7 and thus the common inputs to the systems are the KZG commitments to  <span class="math">z_I(X)</span> , C(X) and T(X). The srs of the full scheme is  <span class="math">(\\{[x^s]_{1,2}\\}_{s=1}^N)</span> , where N is the maximum degree among all polynomials and  <span class="math">x \\leftarrow \\mathbb{F}</span> . Prover and Verifier instantiate  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathsf{IP}}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathsf{IP}}</span>  for the PHP of Fig. 5. All oracle polynomials sent by  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathsf{IP}}</span>  are translated into polynomials evaluated (in the source groups) at x. Polynomial equations are checked by the verifier from group elements using pairings. For quadratic checks, the prover must send the commitments to the polynomials in different source groups.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">All the openings at any point, as well as the degrees of the opened polynomials, are proven using the KZG polynomial commitment. For degree checks with  <span class="math">\\deg(p) = d &lt; N</span>  and p(X) a polynomial that is never opened, the prover sends a single extra polynomial  <span class="math">\\hat{p}(X) = X^{N-d}p(X)</span> , and the verifier checks one extra pairing equation as explained in Section 3.5.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 6.</strong> The protocol in Fig. 6 is a non-interactive argument of knowledge for the relation  <span class="math">R_{cp-expansion}</span>  satisfying knowledge soundness and completeness as in Definition 3.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof.</em> Let  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span>  be an algebraic adversary attempting to break knowledge soundness. We design an extractor  <span class="math">\\mathcal{E}</span>  that behaves as follows.

    <p class="text-gray-300">We show that either  <span class="math">\\mathcal{E}</span>  succeeds with overwhelming probability or we can construct a reductions  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_1</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_2</span>  such that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\underline{\\mathsf{Game}^1 \\mapsto \\mathsf{Game}^2}</span>  We second transition to a game  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Game}^2</span>  that behaves identically to  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Game}^1</span>  except that, when  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span>  outputs the representation  <span class="math">w_3(X)</span> , if  <span class="math">z_I(X) = w_3(X)X^{-(N-k+1)} + X^k</span>  does not divide  <span class="math">z_H(X)</span> , then  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Game}^2</span>  aborts.

    <p class="text-gray-300">See that if  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Game}^2</span>  does not abort, then  <span class="math">z_I = [f(X)]</span>  for some f(X) of degree k that divides  <span class="math">z_H(X)</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">The reduction  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_2</span>  gets as input srs and forwards this reference string to run  <span class="math">(C(X), \\mathsf{cm_t}, [z_I]_2, \\pi) \\leftarrow \\mathcal{A}(\\mathsf{srs})</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">Then  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_2</span>  computes the degree N polynomial  <span class="math">g(X) = Z_H(X) - z_I(X)w_2(X)</span>  and solves to find the N roots.

    <p class="text-gray-300">By the second verification equation we have that  <span class="math">Z_H(x) - g(x)w_2(x) = 0</span>  whenever  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span>  convinces the verifier. See that if g(X) does not divide  <span class="math">Z_H(X)</span> , then  <span class="math">Z_H(X) - g(X)w_2(X) \\neq 0</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">Indeed, when  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span>  also outputs the representation  <span class="math">w_3(X)</span> , we have that either  <span class="math">[z_I]_2 = [z_I(x)]_2</span>  for  <span class="math">z_I(X) = w_3(X)X^{-(N-k+1)} + X^k</span>  a degree N polynomial dividing  <span class="math">z_H(X)</span> , or  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Game}^2</span>  aborts.

Further  <span class="math">T(\\xi_i) = C(\\xi_i) + 0</span>  for all  <span class="math">i \\in [k]</span> , making  <span class="math">z_I(X)</span>  and T(X) a correct witness.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">B Baloo Prover Cost</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we elaborate on the Prover's computational costs while showing that those are quasi-linear in m.</p>

      <h3 id="app-b.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8"><strong>B.1 Optimizations for</strong> cp<strong>-</strong>expansion</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we describe some optimizations that can be applied to the protocol in Fig. <a href="#page-20-0">6</a> in order to achieve a construction with smaller proof size and that requires less work from the verifier.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Opening</strong> <em>t</em> <strong>polynomials in one point.</strong> As noted in <a href="#page-26-4">[GWC19]</a>,<a href="#page-25-5">[CHM</a><sup>+</sup>20], whenever we have many openings of different polynomials at the same point, the prover can provide a joint proof after receiving a random element <em>&gamma;</em> &isin; F from the verifier, i.e., if</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(u_1, [w_1]_1) \\leftarrow \\mathsf{KZG.Open}(\\mathsf{srs}_{\\mathsf{KZG}}, f_1(X), \\deg = d, \\alpha)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">(u_2, [w_2]_1) \\leftarrow \\mathsf{KZG.Open}(\\mathsf{srs}_{\\mathsf{KZG}}, f_2(X), \\deg = d, \\alpha)</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">then [<em>w</em>]<sup>1</sup> = [<em>w</em>1]<sup>1</sup> + <em>&gamma;</em>[<em>w</em>2]<sup>2</sup> is a proof that <em>f</em>1(<em>X</em>) + <em>&gamma;f</em>2(<em>X</em>) opens to <em>u</em><sup>1</sup> + <em>&gamma;u</em><sup>2</sup> at <em>&alpha;</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Openings for Pairings.</strong> To save the verifier some work, we use a technique introduced in <a href="#page-26-4">[GWC19]</a> and attributed to M. Maller. In order to verify that <em>a</em>(<em>X</em>)<em>b</em>(<em>X</em>) = <em>c</em>(<em>X</em>)<em>d</em>(<em>X</em>) for <em>a</em>(<em>X</em>)<em>, b</em>(<em>X</em>)<em>, c</em>(<em>X</em>)<em>, d</em>(<em>X</em>) the algebraic representations of [<em>a</em>]1<em>,</em> [<em>b</em>]2<em>,</em> [<em>c</em>]1<em>,</em> [<em>d</em>]2, instead of asking the verifier to check that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$e([a]_1, [b]_2) = e([c]_1, [d]_2),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">we ask the prover to show that [<em>b</em>]2<em>,</em> [<em>d</em>]<sup>2</sup> open to <em>u</em>1<em>, u</em><sup>2</sup> at <em>&beta;</em> and that <em>u</em>1[<em>a</em>]<sup>1</sup> &minus; <em>u</em>2[<em>c</em>]<sup>1</sup> opens to zero at <em>&beta;</em>. Note that now the prover can also commit to <em>b</em>(<em>X</em>) and <em>d</em>(<em>X</em>) in G<sup>1</sup> instead of G2. We apply this technique to the equations that verify the inner product relation and the well-formedness of [<em>E</em>]1; that is, equations (<em>i</em>) and (<em>ii</em>). Note that we can open this equations together with other elements. Indeed, we will check equation (<em>i</em>) by opening a polynomial [<em>P</em>1]<sup>1</sup> at <em>&beta;</em>, and batch that KZG opening together with the one for [<em>D</em>]1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Degree checks.</strong> Degree checks as deg(<em>f</em>) &le; <em>k &lt; d</em> can be included in a KZG proof that <em>f</em>(<em>&alpha;</em>) = <em>u</em> if the prover sets <em>w</em>&circ;(<em>X</em>) = <em><sup>f</sup></em>(<em>X</em>)&minus;<em>f</em>(<em>&alpha;</em>) <em>X</em>&minus;<em>&alpha;</em> , outputs (<em>u,</em> [<em>w</em>]<sup>1</sup> = [ &circ;<em>w</em>(<em>x</em>)<em>x <sup>d</sup></em>&minus;<em>k</em>+1]) and the verifier checks</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$e([f]_1 - [u]_1, [x^{d-k+1}]_2) = e([w]_1, [x - \\alpha]_2),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">as explained in Section <a href="#page-5-0">3.5.</a> This is conditional on <em>&alpha;</em> being randomly chosen after <em>f</em>(<em>X</em>).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Throughout Ba<em>loo</em> we require 3 degree checks: (<em>i</em>) that deg(<em>E</em>(<em>X</em>)) <em>&lt; m</em>&minus;1, (<em>ii</em>) that deg(<em>z<sup>I</sup></em> (<em>X</em>)) = <em>m</em>, and (<em>iii</em>) that deg(<em>R</em>(<em>X</em>)) = <em>m</em> &minus; 2. For (<em>i</em>) we check via a KZG opening that <em>E</em>(<em>X</em>) has bounded degree. For (<em>ii</em>) we check that <em>z<sup>I</sup></em> (<em>X</em>) &minus; <em>X<sup>m</sup></em> has degree bounded by <em>m</em> &minus; 1 during our opening check that <em>z<sup>I</sup></em> (0) is correct. Degree bounding <em>f</em>(<em>X</em>) <em>&lt; k</em> via an opening at 0 checks that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$e([f]_1 - [u]_1, [1]_2) = e([w]_1, [x]_2),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and
<span class="math">$e([f]_1, [x^{d-k+2}]_2) = e([w]_2, [x]_2),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">because 0 is not a random point.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For (iii) we recall that the polynomial R(X) is sent for the inner product relation to show that  <span class="math">a(X)b(X)-\\sigma=XR(X)+z_I(X)Q(X)</span> . In our optimised protocol we instead send  <span class="math">\\bar{R}(X)=XR(X)</span>  and show that  <span class="math">\\bar{R}(0)=0</span>  and that  <span class="math">\\bar{R}(X)</span>  has degree bounded by m-1. We then show that  <span class="math">a(X)b(X)-\\sigma=\\bar{R}(X)+z_I(X)Q(X)</span> . This is equivalent because  <span class="math">\\bar{R}(0)=0</span>  if and only if  <span class="math">\\bar{R}(X)=XR(X)</span> . Where we can batch this check with opening and degree bounding  <span class="math">z_I(X)</span>  at the same point (namely 0) and with the same degree (m-1), this check is essentially free.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Batching Pairings. We also apply standard techniques to batch pairings that share the same elements in one of the two groups. Namely, upon sampling a uniform  <span class="math">\\gamma_2 \\in \\mathbb{F}</span> , the verifier can aggregate the equations</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$e([a]_1, [b_1]_2) = e([c_1]_1, [d]_2)</span>$
and  <span class="math">e([a]_1, [b_2]_2) = e([c_2]_1, [d]_2),</span>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that we can adapt KZG openings equations so they can be batched further, namely if we parse the verification pairing as  <span class="math">e([f]_1-u+[w]_1\\alpha,[1]_2)=e([w]_1,[x]_2)</span> , then two openings of different polynomials at different points can be verified by two pairings.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, note that in order to check  <span class="math">E(\\alpha) = D(\\beta)</span> , the proves needs to provide proof of both openings but can only send  <span class="math">u_2 = E(\\alpha)</span>  and the verifier checks  <span class="math">D(\\beta)</span>  opens to  <span class="math">u_2</span>  as well.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Table 2:</strong> Comparison table for lookups</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Commit-and-prove lookup tables are especially suitable for the Ethereum Foundation's zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM), which nowadays uses Halo2 with KZG commitments as a backend. In this section we describe an overview of how lookups are currently used in the Halo2 proving system [BGH19] and claim Baloo can be used as a drop-in replacement to</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">the Halo2 lookup argument with better prover efficiency. In other words Ba<em>loo</em> is backwards-compatible with instantiations of Halo2 that use KZG commitments.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Baloo is a proving system for the relation that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathsf{R}_{\\mathsf{lookup}} = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{c|c} \\mathsf{cm_a}; \\ A(X) &amp; \\mathsf{cm_a} = \\mathsf{Commit}(\\mathsf{srs}, A(X)) \\\\ \\forall \\nu \\in \\mathbb{V}, \\ A(\\nu) \\in \\{c_s\\}_{s=1}^N \\end{array} \\right\\}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">\\mathbb{V}</span>  is a set of roots of unity that is <em>independent</em> from N (the size of the lookup table  <span class="math">\\mathsf{cm}_{\\mathsf{c}}</span> ) and Commit is the KZG commitment algorithm [KZG10]. This lookup argument only handles a single column. Suppose instead that we want to prove f(x) = y by precomputing all possible values  <span class="math">T = \\{(x_s, f(x_s))\\}_{s=1}^N</span>  and looking up whether  <span class="math">(x, y) \\in T</span> . To achieve this we require more functionality from our lookup argument. In particular we need to be able to prove a lookup argument over <em>multicolumned</em> tables.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Multi-column Baloo We build on the Halo2 approach <sup>5</sup>. Given a lookup with input column polynomials  <span class="math">[A_0(X), \\ldots, A_{k-1}(X)]</span>  and a multi-columned table of the form  <span class="math">C = \\{c_{i,s}\\}_{i,s=1}^{k,N}</span> , their prover shows that for all  <span class="math">\\nu \\in \\mathbb{V}</span> , there exists some s such that  <span class="math">(A_0(\\nu), \\ldots, A_{k-1}(\\nu)) = (c_{0,s}, \\ldots, c_{k-1,s})</span> . It does this by taking a random linear combination of the input column polynomials and the table columns and then running a lookup argument over the compressed values. We present a similar compression for Baloo such that we can run lookups over multi-columned tables.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Similarly than in Caulk+, described in Section 5.1, the pre-processing phase commits to the table  <span class="math">\\{c_{i,s}\\}_{i,s=1}^{k,N}</span>  by committing to the column polynomials</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$C_s(X) = \\sum_{s=1}^{N} c_s \\lambda_s(X)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">for  <span class="math">\\{\\lambda_s(X)\\}_{s=1}^N</span>  the Lagrange interpolation polynomials of a set of roots of unity  <span class="math">H = \\{\\omega^s\\}_{s=1}^N</span>  of size N. The pre-processing phase also computes auxiliary information for the prover, namely it computes commitments to the polynomials</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\{Q_{i,s}(X) = (C_s(X) - C_s(\\omega_j))/(X - \\omega^s)\\}_{i,s=1}^{k,N},</span>$</p>

The auxiliary information that the prover requires for efficiency, namely commitments to  <span class="math">\\{H_s(X), Q_{\\mathsf{comp},s}(X)\\}_{s \\in I}</span> , can be computed in km time where  <span class="math">m = |\\mathbb{V}|</span>  is the number of lookups.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Thus for  <span class="math">\\mathsf{cm}_{\\mathsf{comp}}</span>  a commitment to  <span class="math">A_{\\mathsf{comp}}(X)</span> , the prover demonstrates that  <span class="math">\\mathsf{cm}_{\\mathsf{comp}} \\in R_{\\mathsf{lookup}}</span>  with respect to the table  <span class="math">C_{\\mathsf{comp}}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we compare Baloo's performance with its most direct competitors: Caulk, Harisa and Merkle Trees with Poseidon Hases. Baloo has been implemented<sup>6</sup> in Rust using the arkworks library [ac22]. We use Caulk's implementation<sup>7</sup> to measure its performance and run Harisa and Merkle Trees using the Legosnark code<sup>8</sup>. We instantiate Baloo, Caulk and Merkle Trees for tables of size  <span class="math">2^{20}</span>  (recall that in RSA based systems performance is independent of table size), and consider  <span class="math">m = 10, 16, 20, 50^9</span> . Benchmarks were obtained by running the respective codes in a laptop with CPU i7-8565U and 8GB of RAM.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We highlight prover work in Fig. 9, where y axis represent prover time, and x axis represent the value of m. We specify running numbers of the provers, as well as verifiers and proof size in Table 2.</p>

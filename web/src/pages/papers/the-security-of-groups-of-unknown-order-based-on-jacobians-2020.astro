    <h6 id="sec-2" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Abstract</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Recent work using groups of unknown order to construct verifiable delay functions, polynomial commitment schemes and non interactive zero knowledge proofs have provoked fresh interest in the construction of efficient cryptographic groups of unknown order. It has been suggested that the Jacobian of hyperelliptic curves of genus 3 could be suitable for this purpose. Regrettably, efficient algorithms to compute the order of the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve are known. Concretely, it is unclear whether these groups are competitive with RSA groups or class groups at or above the 128 bit security level.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-3" class="text-2xl font-bold">1 Background</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">There has been recent burst of interest in cryptographic groups of unknown order, stemming in part from their use in the construction of accumulators, verifiable delay functions, integer and polynomial commitments <em>[8, 9, 11, 16, 17, 22]</em>. Long standing examples of groups of unknown order are RSA groups <span class="math">\\left(\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times}</span> for <span class="math">N=pq</span> semiprime, and the ideal class group of the imaginary quadratic fields <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-D})</span> for <span class="math">D&amp;gt;0</span>. We refer the reader to <em>[6, 7, 10, 14]</em> for details of these groups. In both cases there are index-calculus methods <em>[7, 20, 21]</em> which permit the computation of the order <span class="math">n\\sim N,\\sqrt{D}</span> of these groups in time <span class="math">L_{n}(a,b)=\\exp((b+o(1))\\log^{a}n(\\log\\log n)^{1-a})</span> for <span class="math">a=1/3,1/2</span> respectively and <span class="math">b=O(1)</span>. As a result, current estimates <em>[5, 7]</em> suggest <span class="math">\\log N\\sim 3072</span> or <span class="math">\\log D\\sim 1827</span> for the 128 bit security level.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Recently, Dobson and Galbraith <em>[17]</em> suggest that Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves, particularly of genus 3 over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span>, may be candidate groups of this form. In particular, they note that solving the DLP in these groups is not known to be solvable in less that <span class="math">O(q^{4/3}\\log^{O(1)}q)</span> time, and conjecture that it is conservative to assume computing the group order requires <span class="math">O(q\\log^{O(1)}q)</span> operations. Concretely, they suggest <span class="math">\\log q\\sim 100</span> might be sufficient in practice.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-4" class="text-2xl font-bold">2 Jacobians of curves</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">k</span> be a field with <span class="math">\\mathrm{char}(k)\\neq 2</span>. Then a hyperelliptic curve <span class="math">C</span> of genus <span class="math">g</span> is the smooth completion of the affine curve given by <span class="math">y^{2}=f(x)</span> with <span class="math">f</span> monic, square-free, <span class="math">\\deg(f)=2g+1</span>. Concretely the smooth completion adds a point at infinity. Let <span class="math">\\overline{k}</span> be the algebraic closure of <span class="math">k</span>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">It remains to compute the action of  <span class="math">\\pi</span>  on the basis of  <span class="math">J[\\ell]</span> , without computing dense polynomials of linear degree. To do this one uses a iterative square-and-multiply modulo  <span class="math">\\ell J</span> . This is done by finding some set of functions vanishing on  <span class="math">J[\\ell]</span> , and reducing all intermediate results modulo these functions. For the  <span class="math">g = 1</span>  case, these are the multivariate division polynomials  <span class="math">\\psi_{\\ell}</span> , with  <span class="math">d = \\deg(\\psi_{\\ell}) = O(\\ell^2)</span> . Following Elkies, for  <span class="math">\\sim 1/2</span>  of all primes one can instead work modulo a polynomial of degree  <span class="math">d = O(\\ell)</span>  which reduces the asymptotic complexity substantially. For  <span class="math">g &amp;gt; 1</span> , Cantor gives analogous polynomials for the Mumford form [13], and Abelard [1] proves that these polynomials have degree  <span class="math">d = O_g(\\ell^3)</span>  in general, and  <span class="math">d = O(\\ell^2)</span>  for  <span class="math">g = 3</span> . This allows the complexity to be effectively bounded. Abelard also shows that for curves with real multiplication, the degree is reduced to  <span class="math">d = O(\\ell^{3/g})</span> .</p>

It should be noted that to prove these results, one uses resultant-based techniques [1]. In practice, Gröbner basis reduction is likely to be more efficient, but it is difficult to rigorously prove polynomial-time bounds on these algorithms.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, Abelard [1] provides algorithms to compute the order of this group that are polynomial in  <span class="math">\\log q \\sim 100</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, these naive estimates neglect large constant factors. In [1], a computation with real multiplication with  <span class="math">q = 2^{64} - 19</span> ,  <span class="math">\\ell = 13</span> ,  <span class="math">g = 3</span>  is reported, taking  <span class="math">\\sim 9</span>  days on a 14 core 2.20GHz machine. An additional computation without use of the real multiplication for  <span class="math">q = 2^{64} - 19</span> ,  <span class="math">\\ell = 3</span> ,  <span class="math">g = 3</span>  is reported, taking  <span class="math">\\sim 14</span>  days on the same machine. In both cases the number of field operations is  <span class="math">\\tilde{O}(d^{4g})</span> , where  <span class="math">d = O(\\ell^{2/3})</span>  with real multiplication and  <span class="math">d = O(\\ell^2)</span>  without. These results suggest an estimate for the number of cycles to compute  <span class="math">\\chi \\mod \\ell</span>  for each  <span class="math">\\log q \\sim \\ell &amp;lt; 60</span>  of  <span class="math">\\sim 2^{108-112}</span>  cycles on one core. This would reduce the set of candidate group orders from an interval of size  <span class="math">\\sim 2^{250}</span>  Hasse-Weil interval to a collection of arithmetic progressions of size  <span class="math">\\sim 2^{180}</span> , which is amenable to a  <span class="math">O(2^{90})</span>  square root attack. This suggests that direct computation of the group order may be at least competitive with finding discrete logs.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It should also be noted that this naive estimate assumes no future advances. In the case of Schoof's algorithm, improvements of Elkies and Atkin allowed for the replacement of division polynomials of degree  <span class="math">O(\\ell^2)</span>  by polynomials of degree  <span class="math">O(\\ell)</span>  for some primes. For curves with real multiplication, this splitting can be proved generically for all  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  and all genera, leading to the improved complexities of  <span class="math">\\tilde{O}(\\log q^6)</span>  in the genus 3 case [3]. Any development extending this kind of splitting to a non-trivial fraction of primes for generic curves of genus 3 would immediately reduce the complexity of order finding substantially.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Broadly, this suggests that for the setup phase of hyperelliptic curves to be trustless, either the setup must be rigid or the group must be large enough to protect against these subexponential attacks. Matching <span class="math">L_{q^{3}}(1/2,\\sqrt{2})</span> to the <span class="math">L_{D}(1/2,3/2\\sqrt{2})</span> attacks on the class group suggests that for non-rigid Jacobians <span class="math">\\log(q^{3})\\sim 1100</span> is required for 128 bit security.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-9" class="text-2xl font-bold">7 Conclusions</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The existence of polynomial time algorithms to compute the order of Jacobians on curves of fixed genus may pose a substantial challenge to the use of these groups as groups of unknown order in a cryptographic setting. The largest computations of this form are of only a few core-days, whilst the largest public factorization and discrete log computations are <span class="math">\\sim 1000</span> core-year computations. It is unclear whether practical improvements to the current algorithms will be forthcoming, as has happened with index calculus or with the Elkies-Atkin improvements to Schoof’s algorithm <em>[26, 24]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Choosing parameters to be conservative on paper at the 128 bit level causes genus 3 curves to be of comparable size to RSA or Class groups. More work is needed before the Jacobian groups of genus 3 curves can be recommended as efficient, secure groups of unknown order.</p>

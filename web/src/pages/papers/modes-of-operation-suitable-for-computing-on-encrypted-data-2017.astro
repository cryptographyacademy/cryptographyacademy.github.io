    <p class="text-gray-300">Abstract. We examine how two parallel modes of operation for Authenticated Encryption (namely CTR+PMAC and OTR mode) work when evaluated in a multi-party computation engine. These two modes are selected because they suit the PRFs examined in previous works. In particular the modes are highly parallel, and do not require evaluation of the inverse of the underlying PRF. In order to use these modes one needs to convert them from their original instantiation of being defined on binary blocks of data, to working on elements in a large prime finite field. The latter fitting the use case of many secret-sharing based MPC engines. In doing this conversion we examine the associated security proofs of PMAC and OTR, and show that they carry over to this new setting.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The development of low complexity blockciphers and pseudorandom functions (PRFs) has attracted considerable interest lately. The initial motivation was their suitability to low power devices, as used in IoT applications [LK06, DPAR00, BCG+12]. Recently, these ciphers found a second application for use in systems which compute on encrypted data, such as Multi-Party Computation (MPC) systems and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) mechanisms. In these latter contexts, evaluating the AES function has long been a standard benchmark [PSSW09, DK10, DKL+12, NNOB12, LR15], however we contend that AES is unsuitable for many secure computation applications.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Grassi et al. [GRR+16] already make the case for using blockciphers and PRFs over finite fields of large prime characteristic in MPC applications, as especially MPC systems based on secret sharing typically provide efficient arithmetic operations over such prime fields¹. A key application of blockciphers and PRFs is to authenticate and encrypt data. In an MPC context, the symmetric key and the data would typically reside in the MPC system, where encryption and decryption would take place to create ciphertexts for storage or transmission of sensitive information outside the MPC system. The trivial solution would be to encrypt parties shares separately in such applications, producing a linear (in the number of players) increase in the communication and/or storage of such encrypted data. The next (slightly less) trivial solution would be to use a standard mode-of-operation based on a standard PRF such as AES. But, continual conversion to and from a binary</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">¹In this work we focus exclusively on secret-sharing based MPC over large prime fields. It would be an interesting extension to examine what happens for binary field based secret-sharing based MPC, or garbled-circuit based MPC.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">field as required for say AES would be prohibitively expensive in this context. Thus, a mode of operation based on a PRF over the underlying finite field of the MPC system would seem to offer advantages.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The usual modes of operation for authenticated encryption have a strong binary focus, moreover due to the different cost metrics for secret sharing based MPC, conventional wisdom on what makes for an efficient mode of operation no longer applies. Hence authenticated encryption (AE) suitable for MPC should be benchmarked directly; as the different environment is likely to produce different cost considerations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">When benchmarking AE for MPC, the two main metrics of interest are the overall throughput and latency of what is called the online phase. Both metrics are driven primarily by communication between the various parties and much less by the local computation (which traditionally plays a dominant role). Our focus will be on the paradigm of secret sharing based MPC, as typified by the BDOZ <em>[x1]</em>, SPDZ <em>[x10, DKL^{+}13]</em>, or VIFF <em>[x7]</em> systems. In these systems, the data to be kept secure is secret shared amongst the parties. The computation itself is typically expressed as algebraic operations over a large finite field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p}</span> where, loosely speaking, the secret shared values behave a little like vectors with any open values being treated as scalars. Consequently, additions of secret shared data and scalar multiplications are both cheap (can be performed locally), yet multiplication of secret shared data is expensive. Indeed, this last step requires communication and is often performed by consuming a so-called “Beaver triple,” which has been precomputed in an offline phase.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As a crude estimate, the latency of an overall computation is then dominated by the multiplicative depth (of secret shared values), whereas the throughput is a function of the total number of such multiplications. However, the physical limitations of the network’s bandwidth and latency also play a major part in determining overall throughput and latency. The differences in the computational model affect the design of PRFs and blockciphers in the MPC arena, as exemplified by the blockcipher MiMC <em>[AGR^{+}16]</em> and pseudorandom function Leg <em>[GRR^{+}16]</em>. However, the effect on possible modes of operation, to transform these primitives in practically more relevant authenticated encryption, has thus far not been explored in detail.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-3" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Our Contribution</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We examine how the currently best PRFs for secret shared MPC over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p}</span>, namely MiMC and Leg, can be used to enable nonce-based authenticated encryption, where we benchmark a number of orthogonal options. As alluded to before, we are assuming that the key and the plaintext message are held in secret shared form, but that the nonce and the resulting ciphertext are in the clear. This assumption crucially informs our study.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our first step is to select potential modes of operation for secret-sharing based MPC-driven, nonce-based AE. In making such a selection there are a number of design desiderata to take into account the somewhat unusual computational model. Firstly, the underlying PRF is only ever evaluated in the forward direction, both during encryption and decryption (even though MiMC as a blockcipher does have an inverse, it is rather inefficient). Secondly, the mode should allow a high degree of parallelism of the PRF calls to take full advantage of the ability of secret-sharing based MPC engines to evaluate many operations in parallel. Finally, the further computational overhead (beyond PRF calls) may be complicated, provided it can be performed locally. To enable local computation, it can be worth opening secret shared elements, provided this opening does not negatively affect security.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">When examining various possible modes for authenticated encryption, we found two candidates that best met our overall design criteria: on the one hand, a single combined mode based on OTR <em>[x16]</em>, and on the other an Encrypt-then-MAC methodology using either CTR-Mode plus PMAC <em>[x3]</em>, or CTR-Mode plus Hash-then-Encrypt (where in both cases the CTR-Mode is nonce-based by exploiting a tweakable PRF). We converted the original PMAC and OTR algorithms (which use finite fields of characteristic two) into</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">variants that process blocks consisting of finite field elements in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p}</span>, where <span class="math">p</span> is a large prime (say <span class="math">p&gt;2^{128}</span>). The resulting algorithms we dub pPMAC and pOTR. Here we took care to ensure that the modifications made do not invalidate any of the original security proofs.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Modern modes of operation, including PMAC and OTR, are usually cleanest described based on a tweakable primitive, and we follow suit. This obviously does necessitate the investigation of tweakable PRFs in our MPC context. Luckily, creating tweakable PRFs turns out much easier than in the traditional, binary field setting. In that latter setting, Rogaway’s XE transform <em>[x18]</em> takes a PRF <span class="math">\\mathsf{E}_{\\mathsf{k}}(m)</span> and turns it into a tweakable PRF <span class="math">\\widetilde{\\mathsf{E}}_{\\mathsf{k}}^{i,N}(m)</span> with a tweak <span class="math">(i,N)</span> using a sequence of constants <span class="math">M_{i}</span> in the following manner:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\widetilde{\\mathsf{E}}_{\\mathsf{k}}^{i,N}(m)=\\mathsf{E}_{\\mathsf{k}}(m\\oplus(M_{i}\\cdot\\mathsf{E}_{\\mathsf{k}}(N)))\\ .</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is important that the constants <span class="math">M_{i}</span> do not repeat, and be easy to compute. This led many authors to select <span class="math">M_{i}=2^{T_{1}}\\cdot 3^{T_{2}}</span> for two functions <span class="math">T_{1},T_{2}</span> depending on <span class="math">i</span>. This choice is prompted by the characteristic two field, with the exact tweak applied depending on the field order. In our setting of large prime characteristic, we obtain a trivial schedule by using a standard integer representation of the field:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\widetilde{\\mathsf{E}}_{\\mathsf{k}}^{i,N}(m)=\\mathsf{E}_{\\mathsf{k}}(m+(i\\cdot\\mathsf{E}_{\\mathsf{k}}(N)))\\ .</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With CTR-then-pPMAC as an encryption methodology on a message consisting of <span class="math">\\ell</span> finite field elements (i.e. <span class="math">\\ell</span> blocks in this context), we apply one round of <span class="math">\\ell</span> tweakable-PRF evaluations to encrypt the <span class="math">\\ell</span> message blocks, then another round of <span class="math">\\ell-1</span> tweakable-PRF evaluations to produce a final MAC block, to which a final tweakable-PRF evaluation is performed. Ignoring non-message dependent PRF evaluations this means we need to evaluate <span class="math">2\\cdot\\ell</span> PRF evaluations in a total of three parallel rounds. For the CTR+Hash-then-MAC mode we apply one round of <span class="math">\\ell</span> tweakable-PRF evaluations to encrypt the <span class="math">\\ell</span> message blocks, then a hash function in the clear to produce an intermediate open value, to which a final tweakable-PRF evaluation is performed. This means we need to evaluate <span class="math">\\ell+1</span> PRF evaluations in a total of two parallel rounds. For the OTR mode we evaluate first a PRF on a nonce block, then apply <span class="math">\\ell</span> PRF calls in two rounds (essentially performing a two round Feistel network). A final PRF evaluation produces the tag. Overall, we require <span class="math">\\ell+2</span> PRF evaluations over four parallel rounds to evaluate OTR mode. Not surprisingly, we find that CTR+Hash-then-MAC turns out to be the most efficient of these modes of operation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In a second step we implemented the modes using the above two PRFs to see which performed better in practice. Our experiments are carried out using the publicly available SPDZ engine <em>[x5, DKL^{+}13]</em>, though any classical protocol based on Shamir secret sharing could also be used. Previously, Grassi et al. <em>[GRR^{+}16]</em> conducted experiments under the assumptions that the input and the output to the PRF need to be kept in secret shared form. However, when used within one of the above modes of operation this may no longer true, enabling further optimizations to be made into precisely how the PRFs are evaluated within the MPC system. A topic which we explore in this paper.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Grassi et al. furthermore imply that the Leg PRF is to be preferred over the MiMC PRF, as the Leg PRF (based on the Legendre symbol) had both a lower online round cost and lower offline pre-processing costs. Their experiments seemed to confirm this preference. Interestingly, when used within a mode of operation supporting parallel processing of the blocks, we find that the MiMC PRF performs much better. Though the Leg PRF has low round complexity and low computational cost (when computational cost is measured in an MPC environment), its per-round communication cost is high. Thus for each round of communication the number of bits sent between the MPC servers is much larger than that for MiMC. When many PRF applications are done in parallel this high per round communication cost causes network bottlenecks, resulting in a linear scaling in the runtime</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">as the number of blocks processed increases. For MiMC, reaching network saturation takes longer and so, as the number of blocks processed is increased, the runtime only degrades sub-linearly. Hence, MiMC will often significantly outperform Leg.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-4" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Related Work</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Several recent papers have examined new low complexity blockciphers and PRFs in the context of both MPC and FHE applications. For example, a blockcipher called LowMC <em>[ARS+15]</em> is suitable for both MPC and FHE applications, whereas a a stream cipher called Kreyvium <em>[CCF+16]</em>, based on the Trivium stream cipher, is targeted at FHE applications. Another stream cipher, FLIP, was cryptanalysed shortly after it was presented <em>[MJS+16, DLR+16]</em>. The blockcipher MiMC <em>[AGR+16]</em> was originally targeted at SNARK applications, but later found to have potential for MPC style applications: Grassi et al. <em>[GRR+16]</em> discuss the MiMC blockcipher and a new PRF based on the Legendre symbol in the context of the SPDZ MPC engine.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As well as examining the basic PRF primitives, Grassi et al. <em>[GRR+16]</em> also touched upon basic techniques to provide domain extension, concentrating on the established CBC-MAC construction and the Merkle–Damgård construction. However, both of these methods are sequential in nature, and hence are significantly less efficient in an MPC context than the highly parallel modes examined by us. Moreover, Grassi et al. <em>[GRR+16]</em> neither address codomain extension (notwithstanding one of their section headings) nor authenticated encryption, even though both are crucial for encryption applications.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we recall the basic notions of authenticated encryption (AE) and its constituent building block pseudorandom function (PRF), as well as generic design considerations in the context of multiparty computation (MPC), including details on the two existing PRFs designed for MPC that we will build upon.

    <h3 id="sec-8" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2.3 MPC Model</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">MPC systems ideally support an arbitrary number of players and various collusions of dishonest parties. The most efficient MPC systems of this type, such as BDOZ <em>[x1]</em>, SPDZ <em>[x12, DKL^{+}13]</em>, and VIFF <em>[x10]</em>, are based on secret sharing and are typified by a number of shared properties and constraints.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The inputs to the computation are elements of a finite field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p}</span>. Those elements <span class="math">x</span> that have to be kept secret are held in secret shared form. To denote that a variable is held in secret shared form we shall write <span class="math">[x]</span>. A variable which is not secret shared will be said to be in the <em>clear</em>. A secret shared value can be turned into a clear value at any point in the computation; such an operation is called an <em>opening</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Computation itself is split between a relatively inefficient pre-processing phase followed by a more efficient online phase. The pre-processing phase is often called the offline phase and is mostly independent of any inputs from the parties; it is mainly tasked with producing shared Beaver triples <span class="math">([x],[y],[x\\cdot y])</span>. However, the offline phase can also produce other shared data that may depend on persistent user inputs, for instance we will assume that the sharing <span class="math">[\\mathbf{k}]</span> of some symmetric primitive’s key will be available during the offline phase. Consequently, by producing more complex pre-processed data one can perform more complex operations in the online phase more cheaply. At a minimum, we also assume the pre-processing produces shared random bits <span class="math">[b]</span> where <span class="math">b\\in\\{0,1\\}</span> and shared random squares <span class="math">([r],[r^{2}])</span> where <span class="math">r\\in\\mathbb{F}_{p}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To measure the MPC complexity of a function we concentrate on the online phase. The function evaluation will require parties to both perform local computations and to communicate with one another (this holds both for the offline and online phase by the way). The local computation is usually mostly ignored when considering MPC complexity, instead the focus is strongly on the communication. This communication is performed in <em>rounds</em>, where all parties can send as much data to any other party as they wish, based on the information they have received in previous rounds. The two main metrics for the communication are the round complexity and the number of openings (how many</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">secret shared elements are opened to elements in the clear). Unless the amount of data communicated in a single round floods the network capacity, the round complexity strongly determines the latency required to compute the desired function securely. The number of openings is a strong indicator of throughput as it indicates how much data the network has to accommodate. Openings themselves take one round, but in one round many openings could potentially be performed in parallel.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The main operations over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p}</span> are addition and multiplication. Both addition of secret shared values and scalar multiplication by clear values can be performed locally (i.e. without interaction) and are deemed efficient: neither contributes to the number of rounds or openings of the overall computation. On the other hand, multiplication of secret shared values does require a round of interaction between the players: it requires two openings, which can be done in parallel thus consuming one round. Additionally, the multiplication will consume one of the pre-processed Beaver Triples. A value can also be squared by consuming a shared random square; this only requires one opening, yet still takes one round of interaction.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To reduce the number of online rounds when optimizing MPC, the main techniques are moving input-independent computation to the pre-processing stage, parallelizing computations during the online stage, and performing early openings to allow cheaper, subsequent operations on clear instead of shared elements. We will see examples of all three techniques in what follows.</p>

The cipher is a classical iterated Even–Mansour cipher using a simple algebraic round permutation inspired by a cipher by Nyberg and Knudsen <em>[x20]</em>. When incorporating the key addition prior to applying the permutation, the round function is defined by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">F_{i}(x)=(x+\\mathbf{k}+c_{i})^{3}\\ ,</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where the <span class="math">c_{i}\\in\\mathbb{F}_{p}</span> are randomly chosen round constants that “are fixed once and can be hard-coded into the implementation” <em>[AGR^{+}16]</em>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Originally, <span class="math">r=\\lceil\\log_{3}p\\rceil</span> rounds were suggested for security <em>[AGR^{+}16, Section 5]</em>. For a prime <span class="math">p</span> of 128 bits this would lead to <span class="math">r=82</span> rounds for full keyed-permutation security. However, if the attacker only has access to a limited number <span class="math">n\\leq 2^{115}</span> of plaintext/ciphertext pairs then the number of rounds can be reduced to <span class="math">r=73</span> <em>[AGR^{+}16, Section 4.3]</em>.</p>

Although at that time there was no security proof that the resulting PRF is secure, several reductions were made later to the decision shifted Legendre symbol (DSLS) problem <em>[x22, x13]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The PRF <span class="math">\\mathsf{Leg}_{\\mathsf{bit}}:\\mathbb{F}_{p}\\times\\mathbb{F}_{p}^{*}\\longrightarrow\\{0,1\\}</span> is initialized with a random key <span class="math">k\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle\\mathsf{k}}}{{\\leftarrow}}\\mathbb{F}_{p}</span>. To evaluate it on input <span class="math">x</span>, we simply call the Legendre symbol on <span class="math">k+x</span> and normalise the output to be in <span class="math">\\{0,1\\}</span> as opposed to <span class="math">\\{-1,1\\}</span>. It is known that <span class="math">\\mathsf{Leg}_{\\mathsf{bit}}</span> is a pseudorandom</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This function can be extended to produce a field element by selecting a vector of keys  <span class="math">\\mathsf{k} = (k_i) \\in \\mathbb{F}_p^L</span>  and by computing  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Leg}(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{L-1} 2^i \\cdot \\operatorname{Leg}_{\\mathrm{bit}}(k_i, x) \\pmod{p}</span> , for some value  <span class="math">L</span> . Assuming  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Leg}</span>  outputs an unbiased random bit, for general  <span class="math">p</span>  one still needs to select  <span class="math">L = \\lceil 2 \\cdot \\log_2 p \\rceil</span>  to ensure statistical closeness to the uniform distribution over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> , however if  <span class="math">p</span>  is chosen sufficiently close to a power of two then one can relax to  <span class="math">L = \\lceil \\log_2 p \\rceil</span>  [GRR+16].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">When evaluating a tweakable PRF in an MPC setting, the key will always be secret and the tweak will always be in the clear, but whether the main input and output are held in the clear or are secret shared will depend on the application. Consequently, when optimizing MiMC and Leg we need to make a distinction between four cases, depending on whether the input and/or output is held in the clear or is secret shared. These four variants we will denote by the notation in Figure 4 in subsequent diagrams, with an opening operation denoted by a coloured circle (red denoting a shared data item, and blue a data item held in the clear).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In prior work on the MPC evaluation of MiMC and Leg, only the fourth and, for Leg only, the third variant were discussed  <span class="math">\\left[\\mathrm{GRR}^{+}16\\right]</span> . As we will see, the other variants are more useful when defining modes of operation, and they can have a remarkably reduced MPC complexity. Another major consideration is whether one is interested in online times subject to standard pre-processing (in which multiplication triples, random squares and random bits are prepared ahead of time), or whether one is interested in key dependent pre-processing for the specific PRF in question, or even tweak (and key) dependent pre-processing for the specific tweakable PRF in question.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the tweakable context, we can express the design in a similar pictorial way as in Figure 5. However, the distinction as to whether the actual message is in the clear disappears, as even in this case the input to the second PRF call is made on shared data due to the need to keep the output of the first PRF shared. Thus we really only have two cases to consider for general PRFs, although specific PRFs may have additional optimizations (see below for one such optimization in the case of the Leg PRF).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Grassi et al.  <span class="math">\\left[\\mathrm{GRR}^{+}16\\right]</span>  consider two methods for computing MiMC in an MPC setting:  <span class="math">\\mathsf{MiMC}^{\\mathrm{basic}}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathsf{MiMC}^{\\mathrm{cube}}</span> . Given our focus on online times for latency and throughput, only  <span class="math">\\mathsf{MiMC}^{\\mathrm{cube}}</span>  is of interest to us; henceforth we'll simply call it MiMC.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using Standard Pre-Processing The computation of  <span class="math">[y] \\gets [x] + [k] + c_i</span>  can always be performed locally, so of interest is the cubing  <span class="math">[y^3]</span> . The standard MPC method to compute MiMC uses a special pre-processed tuple  <span class="math">([v], [v^2], [v^3])</span>  for which  <span class="math">v \\stackrel{\\S}{\\leftarrow} \\mathbb{F}_p</span> . This pre-processed tuple itself could be computed using squaring and multiplication during the offline phase, or it can be done in the online phase. Given this tuple, to obtain  <span class="math">[y^3]</span>  from  <span class="math">[y]</span>  we open  <span class="math">z = y - v</span>  to all parties and then compute locally:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">[ y ^ {3} ] = 3 \\cdot z \\cdot [ v ^ {2} ] + 3 \\cdot z ^ {2} \\cdot [ v ] + z ^ {3} + [ v ^ {3} ].</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Assuming the required  <span class="math">r</span>  tuples  <span class="math">([v], [v^2], [v^3])</span>  have been computed during the offline phase, the online phase reduces to one opening and one communication round per cipher round, for a total of  <span class="math">r</span>  openings and  <span class="math">r</span>  communication rounds for full evaluation of the cipher. If the tuple is produced in the online phase then we require  <span class="math">3 \\cdot r</span>  openings and  <span class="math">r + 1</span>  rounds of communication (as all  <span class="math">r</span>  tuples can be processed simultaneously). In the case where the output is in the clear we require an additional opening and round.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using Key Dependent Pre-Processing If the input to MiMC is in the clear then a marginal improvement in performance results from the local evaluation of the first round function  <span class="math">F_{0}([k],x) = (x + [k] + c_{0})^{3}</span> , where we need the values  <span class="math">([k],[k^2],[k^3])</span>  to be precomputed. As the improvement is only minor over the general method above, we ignore this optimization in what follows.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using Tweak Dependent Pre-Processing When evaluating the tweakable-PRF on a fixed nonce  <span class="math">N</span>  known at pre-processing time, say  <span class="math">N = 0</span>  or  <span class="math">N = 1</span> , we could precompute the value of  <span class="math">[M] = \\mathsf{E}_{[k]}(N)</span> . We treat this case as tweak dependent pre-processing, as opposed to key dependent pre-processing, as it assumes knowledge of the application usage of the PRF at pre-processing time.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Recall the Leg PRF is defined by</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\mathsf {E} _ {\\mathsf {k}} (x) = \\mathsf {L e g} (x) = \\sum_ {i = 0} ^ {L - 1} 2 ^ {i} \\cdot \\mathsf {L e g} _ {\\mathsf {b i t}} (k _ {i}, x) \\quad (\\mathrm {m o d} p)</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Modes of Operation Suitable for Computing on Encrypted Data</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">\\mathsf{k} = \\{k_i\\}_{i = 0}^{L - 1}</span> . When evaluating Leg it suffices to compute the  <span class="math">L</span>  invocations of  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Leg}_{\\mathsf{bit}}</span>  in parallel, followed by local computations for the linear combination of the  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Leg}_{\\mathsf{bit}}</span>  outputs into  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Leg}(x)</span>  (after all, multiplications by public constants and additions can be done locally without any interaction between parties). If the final output of Leg should be in the clear, then the  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Leg}_{\\mathsf{bit}}</span>  already may be in the clear (implicitly this observation uses that the indistinguishability of Leg follows from that of  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Leg}_{\\mathsf{bit}}</span> ). Thus the MPC complexity of Leg is equivalent to that of computing  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Leg}_{\\mathsf{bit}}</span>  in parallel.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note, we could use a tweak to also define the extra keys needed in the extension of  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Leg}_{\\mathsf{bit}}</span>  to  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Leg}</span> , thus saving storage at the expense of the evaluation of the tweak. Thus the tweakable  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Leg}</span> , would be built out of a tweakable  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Leg}_{\\mathsf{bit}}</span>  with two tweak inputs (one for the domain extension to  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Leg}</span>  and one for the actual tweak on the  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Leg}</span>  function itself).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using Standard Pre-Processing Grassi et al.  <span class="math">\\left[\\mathrm{GRR}^{+}16\\right]</span>  present an efficient method to compute  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Leg}_{\\mathsf{bit}}</span>  (reproduced in Figure 6) when the input  <span class="math">[x]</span>  and output  <span class="math">[y]</span>  are both secret shared. Grassi et al. already observe that the two steps leading up to the computation of  <span class="math">u</span>  can be pre-processed and that the step following the computation of  <span class="math">u</span>  can be performed locally. The computation of  <span class="math">u</span>  itself takes one round (containing two openings) to compute  <span class="math">[t] \\cdot ([k] + [x])</span>  and one to open the result. Thus if a fixed quadratic non-residue  <span class="math">\\alpha</span>  and the data tuples  <span class="math">([b], [t])</span>  are produced during the offline phase, then the online computation of the PRF  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Leg}_{\\mathsf{bit}}([x])</span>  will require two rounds of communication and three openings. Without the special pre-processed tuples we would require an extra round and two extra openings.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Grassi et al. additionally suggest an alternative, conceptually easier evaluation when the input is shared but the output should be in the clear: on input  <span class="math">[x]</span>  take a preprocessed square  <span class="math">[s^2]</span> , evaluate  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Open}([s^2] \\cdot ([k] + [x]))</span>  and output the Legendre symbol of the result. This version still requires two rounds of interaction and three openings, but it only consumes standard pre-processed data.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using Key Dependent Pre-Processing However, the implementation suggestions by Grassi et al. are not the end of the story. We first investigate what happens when the input  <span class="math">x</span>  is provided in the clear, and we allow key dependent pre-processing.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our key observation is that if the input  <span class="math">x</span>  is in the clear, then we can store  <span class="math">([b], [t], [t \\cdot k])</span>  in the offline phase. This allows simplification of Step 3 from Figure 6 to  <span class="math">u \\gets \\mathsf{Open}([t \\cdot k] + x \\cdot [t])</span> , which requires only one round of interaction as multiplication by clear values is free. Step 4 proceeds (locally) as before, leading to a shared output.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If both input and output are in the clear, the product  <span class="math">[s^2 \\cdot k]</span>  can be preprocessed and the only online communication remaining is for  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Open}([s^2 \\cdot k] + x \\cdot [s^2])</span> , namely one round and one opening.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 7 presents a method to compute Leg as a whole for key dependent pre-processing of the tweakable cipher when presented with a fresh value  <span class="math">N</span> . The method presented works for a shared input  <span class="math">[x]</span> , requiring multiplications in Step 2b. These can be done in parallel with the openings of Step 2a, thus for a shared input, the online costs amounts to two rounds of interaction and  <span class="math">3L + 1</span>  openings. If  <span class="math">x</span>  is clear, then Step 2b can be performed locally, reducing the total number of openings to  <span class="math">L + 1</span> ; the number of rounds remains 2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For more complicated calculations, such as re-use of the same  <span class="math">N</span>  in a future sequential call to the tweakable PRF, some pipelining might be feasible. For instance, the respective Steps 2a can still be performed in parallel. However, the gains over a straightforward approach—treating the sequential composition of two tweakable PRF calls as three sequential PRF calls—are not worth the significant increase in consumption of pre-processed data. Whereas standard pre-processing only precomputes  <span class="math">O(L)</span>  elements, for Figure 7 we need to pre-process  <span class="math">O(L^2)</span>  elements instead.

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is clear the design choices for implementation depend very much on how much specialised pre-processing one wants to perform. In the rest of this paper we restrict ourselves to the case where we allow key-dependent, but not tweak dependent pre-processing. In this context our tweakable PRF this is then produced via our non-tweakable PRF via the methodology given in Figure 5. Note, when the message in this diagram is given in the clear, this makes no difference to the execution of the second PRF call, as the input is already in shared form.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Dragos Rotaru, Nigel P. Smart and Martijn Stam</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In addition, any second call to the tweakable PRF with the same value  <span class="math">N</span>  in the tweak can be done without the need to call the first PRF again. When the output of the tweakable PRF is to be returned in an open form, the second PRF call can be performed more efficiently in the case of Leg by using the key-dependent pre-processing variant. This leads to the online costs given in Table 1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 1: Summary of costs for our PRFs MiMC and Leg. The first line for each PRF is the cost of the first such tweakable PRF call, and the second is the cost of subsequent PRF tweakable calls with the same  <span class="math">N</span>  component in the tweak (clearly their is no second line when we use tweakable pre-processing). The values SP, KP, and TP stand for standard pre-processing, key dependent pre-processing and tweak dependent pre-processing. Note the costs when the input message is in the clear are identical to when the input message is in shared form. The pre-processing costs are given in the number of data items needed to be produced by the pre-preprocessing.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we examine an Encrypt-then-MAC paradigm to obtain AE for messages/ciphertexts consisting of vectors in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> . To enable the efficient computation we select a nonce-based IND-CPA encryption mode which is highly parallel (specifically a modification of CTR mode). For the MAC algorithm we present two possibilities, a Hash-then-MAC method (which is suitable as we always MAC clear data), as well as a new MAC algorithm which we call pPMAC. Here pPMAC is the obvious port of PMAC from binary fields to the field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> , where we examine the PMAC proof to ensure that the scheme is still secure.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The encrypt-then-MAC paradigm originally applied probabilistic encryption followed by authentication of the resulting ciphertext [BN08]. The probabilistic encryption itself only needs to be PRIV or IND-CPA secure. Moving to a nonce-setting is relatively straightforward [NRS14]: assuming one has a MAC function, one simply needs to combine a nonce based encryption (E, D) scheme which is just PRIV (i.e. IND-CPA) secure, and then authenticate the nonce and the obtained ciphertext with a tag generated from a secure MAC function MacGen. This composition corresponds to scheme 'N2' as studied by Namprempre et al. [NRS14]. This scheme is the only one of the four secure schemes (N1 up to N4) that feeds the ciphertext as opposed to the message to the MAC function. As in our context ciphertext is in the clear whereas messages is shared—and we do not</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Modes of Operation Suitable for Computing on Encrypted Data</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">believe that the slightly increased parallelism allowed by N1's encrypt-and-MAC approach outweighs this advantage—we opted for this N2 mode.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To obtain a nonce based scheme two variants of CTR mode are possible, either</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">c _ {i} \\leftarrow m _ {i} + \\widetilde {\\mathsf {E}} _ {\\mathbf {k}} ^ {1, N} (i) = m _ {i} + \\mathsf {E} _ {\\mathbf {k}} (i + \\mathsf {E} _ {\\mathbf {k}} (N)),</span></div>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">c _ {i} \\leftarrow m _ {i} + \\widetilde {\\mathsf {E}} _ {\\mathbf {k}} ^ {i, 1} (N) = m _ {i} + \\mathsf {E} _ {\\mathbf {k}} (N + i \\cdot \\mathsf {E} _ {\\mathbf {k}} (1)).</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The latter variants is preferred as  <span class="math">\\mathsf{E_k}(1)</span>  can be precomputed when allowing key dependent pre-processing; it corresponds to a simplified variant of CTR-in-Tweak [PS16].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To this CTR mode nonce-based IND-CPA encryption we then add authentication via a MAC function. See Figure 9, where we use this CTR mode as the underlying encryption scheme and an arbitrary MAC function. In this figure we present the algorithm, making specific reference to what data is shared and what is open. The reader should note that in decryption we need to perform a secure comparison between the input tag (in the clear), and the computed tag (in shared form). This is easily accomplished, by opening the value  <span class="math">[r] \\cdot ([\\mathsf{Tag}&#x27;] - \\mathsf{Tag})</span> , for a random value  <span class="math">r</span>  from the pre-processing, and comparing the value to zero.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The original PMAC algorithm [BR02] operates (after suitable padding) on elements in the finite field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}</span> . The algorithm makes use of various constants, which in the original PMAC are taken to be from a Gray code to enable efficient computation. In addition a "large" constant called Huge is defined, which is equal to  <span class="math">1 / x</span>  for  <span class="math">x</span>  being the formal root of the defining polynomial for the field. The tag is produced by utilizing an encryption function defined by  <span class="math">\\mathsf{E_k}(m):\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{2^n}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">PMAC1 [Rog04] is a conceptually simpler version of PMAC that recasts the masked blockcipher calls as direct, tweakable blockcipher ones instead. This abstraction is especially potent when moving to  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  and using a tweakable PRF. As we will be using  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p^\\times</span>  as tweak space, we can set  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Huge} = p - 1</span>  (to be used by the final  <span class="math">\\widetilde{\\mathsf{E}}</span>  call) and use tweak  <span class="math">i</span>  to process message block  <span class="math">m_i</span> , for  <span class="math">i \\in \\{1, \\dots, p - 2\\}</span> . Hence our  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  variant of PMAC1, henceforth referred to as pPMAC, takes in a message which is at most  <span class="math">p - 2</span>  finite field elements long and produces an element of the finite field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  as final tag; the precise pPMAC algorithm is given in Figure 10.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">While the security of PMAC over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}</span>  has achieved ample attention [MM07, DY15, LPSY16], the security for our pPMAC version doesn't seem to follow directly from prior work. Hence we present Theorem 2 to bound an adversary's distinguishing advantage.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Theorem 2. Let  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span>  be a PRF-adversary against pPMAC making  <span class="math">q</span>  queries having a total message length of  <span class="math">\\sigma</span>  finite field elements.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof. Let  <span class="math">G_0</span>  be the original pPMAC game and let  <span class="math">G_1</span>  be the game with the keyed  <span class="math">\\widetilde{\\mathsf{E}}</span>  replaced by an ideal tweakable random function. Let  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}</span>  be the adversary against  <span class="math">\\widetilde{\\mathsf{E}}</span>  that runs  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span>  and uses its  <span class="math">\\widetilde{\\mathsf{E}}</span>  oracle to evaluate pPMAC for  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span> , then</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where the number of  <span class="math">\\widetilde{\\mathsf{E}}</span>  calls induced by  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span> 's queries is at most  <span class="math">\\sigma + q</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}</span> 's overhead otherwise is minimal.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">G_{2}</span>  be the game where bad is set if two inputs cause colliding final  <span class="math">\\widetilde{\\mathsf{E}}</span>  calls (with tweak Huge). As the tweak Huge cannot be used for any other  <span class="math">\\widetilde{\\mathsf{E}}</span>  calls, if no such collisions appear we can replace the tag output by a freshly drawn  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  elements in  <span class="math">G_{2}</span> . Then  <span class="math">G_{1}</span>  and  <span class="math">G_{2}</span>  are identical until bad. Moreover, to analyse the probability that  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span>  sets bad in  <span class="math">G_{2}</span>  we may restrict without loss of generality to non-adaptive adversaries.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For any given pair of distinct queries, there has to be at least one  <span class="math">\\widetilde{\\mathsf{E}}</span>  call that is made with distinct inputs (if the messages are identical until the final message block, no collision is possible). For a collision to occur, fix the outputs for all the other message blocks (of this query pair) and one of the distinct message blocks of the colliding pair, then the  <span class="math">\\widetilde{\\mathsf{E}}</span>  value (for the corresponding distinct input) has to hit a specific value, which happens only with probability  <span class="math">1 / p</span> . A union bound over all  <span class="math">\\binom{q}{2}</span>  pairs results in the stated bound.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In an MPC context, we are primarily interested in an implementation where both the message and the tag are available in the clear, as our use case concentrates on the Encrypt-then-MAC setting where pPMAC will be applied on an already opened ciphertext. Figure 11 shows the implications for the underlying tweakable PRF calls, in the key dependent pre-processing setting. Note that the  <span class="math">N</span> -tweak is fixed to  <span class="math">N = 0</span>  which allows preprocessing of  <span class="math">[M] = \\mathsf{E}_{[\\mathsf{k}]}(0)</span>  as required in each call to  <span class="math">\\widetilde{\\mathsf{E}}_{[\\mathsf{k}]}^{i,\\mathsf{0}}(m)</span> . Also, notice that a naive implementation of the tweakable PRF will result that the remaining PRF applications will be on shared inputs even if  <span class="math">m</span>  itself is clear, courtesy of  <span class="math">[M]</span>  being shared. When combined with our CTR mode encryption we obtain an AE method given in Figure 12.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Whilst having pPMAC as a general MAC function might be useful in some other contexts, in terms of creating a MAC for use in an Encrypt-then-MAC AE scheme the pPMAC function is overkill. A simpler alternative, described in Figure 13 is to simply hash the clear ciphertext values  <span class="math">c_{i}</span>  and then apply a single invocation of the PRF to the output Note, the tweak  <span class="math">N</span>  value can be the same for this PRF call, as for the PRF calls in the CTR mode.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One has to convert the output of the hash function function  <span class="math">H</span>  into an element modulo  <span class="math">p</span> , so it can be passed into our PRF. We require that the value passed to the PRF satisfies the collision resistance property. If  <span class="math">H</span>  is chosen to be a standard hash function such as SHA-256 or SHA-3, then simply truncating the hash value to  <span class="math">\\log_2 p</span>  bits and treating the result as an integer modulo  <span class="math">p</span>  will suffice.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">OTR is a nonce-based AE mode of operation for blockciphers [Min14]. It has a number of advantages that make it eminently suitable for adaptation to an MPC context, in particular its use of the forward direction of the blockcipher only (even for decryption) and its high level of parallelization for both encryption and decryption. The original OTR mode allows the encryption of arbitrary length bitstrings using arbitrary length bitstrings of associated data. In this section we will adapt Minematsu's OTR to encrypt arbitrary vectors of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  elements based on a tweakable pseudorandom function, where we discard any associated data. Consequently, much of the complexity of the original OTR, for instance related to padding to some multiple of the blocklength, disappears. Although OTR strictly speaking is a blockcipher mode of operation, Minematsu already presents OTR as a tweakable blockcipher mode of operation instantiated with a specific tweakable blockcipher. Our version of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  will be based on this perspective, making use of an  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  tweakable PRF  <span class="math">\\widetilde{\\mathbf{E}}</span>  (which need not need be invertible). The tweaks needed in our  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  variant are fairly straightforward. This contrasts with a relatively complex tweak schedule in the original OTR to avoid colliding masks over the finite field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}</span>  (cf. [BS16]). Finally, in order to present a cleaner implementation we removed the final block switch.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our modified construction is presented in Figure 14 and Figure 15: encryption takes the key  <span class="math">\\mathsf{k}</span>  as well as a nonce  <span class="math">N\\in \\mathbb{F}_p</span>  and a message  <span class="math">\\mathbf{m}\\in \\mathbb{F}_p^<em></span> , producing a ciphertext  <span class="math">\\mathbf{c}\\in \\mathbb{F}_p^</em></span>  and a tag  <span class="math">\\mathrm{Tag}\\in \\mathbb{F}_p</span> , whereas decryption takes the key  <span class="math">\\mathsf{k}</span>  as well as  <span class="math">N\\in \\mathbb{F}_p</span> , a ciphertext  <span class="math">\\mathbf{c}</span> , and a tag  <span class="math">\\mathrm{Tag}</span>  to produce a message  <span class="math">\\mathbf{m}</span>  (or an invalid ciphertext symbol  <span class="math">\\bot</span> ). Encryption only works for messages with fewer than  <span class="math">p / 2</span>  elements, with longer messages (and ciphertexts) rejected out of hand.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A diagramatic representation of encryption is given in Figure 16, where we additionally highlight some MPC implementation details. OTR's core encryption component is a two-round Feistel structure. Here one cannot use an output in the clear for the PRF—which would potentially be faster, especially for Leg—as this would be tantamount to using a public string as one-time pad and hence woefully insecure.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Decryption follows in a similar manner, see Figure 17. Note that, as for our previous MAC-then-Encrypt constructions, a secure comparison is needed to process the computed tag in the decryption algorithm.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Minematsu proved that the original (bit-oriented) OTR is a secure AEAD scheme against nonce-respecting adversaries. Our modified  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  largely inherits the original properties, but for completeness we provide the relevant theorems and proofs below, where we of course draw heavily on Minematsu's work. For OTR's security analysis Minematsu uses an alternative and conceptually cleaner mode, dubbed OTR [Min14, Fig. 5], that is based on a tweakable  <span class="math">n</span> -bit URF. This mode already matches ours a lot closer, as we use a tweakable PRF and the switch from a tweakable PRF to a tweakable URF is standard (incurring precisely the tweakable PRF advantage). We will ignore the parameter  <span class="math">\\tau</span>  (in OTR[τ]) for the length of tags, as it becomes moot in our  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  setting. Minematsu additionally introduces OTR', but in the absence of associated data this mode collapses to OTR. Thus we can safely refer to the security result for OTR' [Min14, Theorem 3] and its proof [Min14, Appendix A]. The proof for privacy is essentially unchanged (and still straightforward),</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">whereas for authenticity we can simplify the proof considerably as there are fewer cases to consider due to our switch from bitstrings to elements of <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The first, standard step is to substitute the tweakable PRF with its ideal cousin, the tweakable URF, throughout. An adversary <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span> that could distinguish between these two worlds can be turned into a reduction <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}</span> that wins the PRF’s security game by explicitly evaluating the <span class="math">\\mathsf{OTR}</span> construction using a tweakable PRF/URF oracle. A counting exercise will show that <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span>’s queries to the construction induce exactly <span class="math">\\sigma+q</span> queries to the underlying tweakable primitive.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With the tweakable URF in place, the key observation is that <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span> is nonce-respecting and that, for the encryption of a single message, the tweaks count from <span class="math">1,\\ldots,\\ell</span> and, as we enforce <span class="math">\\ell&lt;p/2</span>, the tweak <span class="math">-\\ell</span> used for authentication will be distinct from these tweaks (modulo <span class="math">p</span>). Consequently, each tweak <span class="math">(i,N)</span> is used at most once and we can replace the outputs of the tweakable URF with independently and uniformly drawn <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p}</span> elements, ignoring the input. These random <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p}</span> elements act as a one-time pad; inspection shows that all ciphertext elements <span class="math">c_{i}</span> as well as the <span class="math">\\mathsf{Tag}</span> are thus affected, making them perfectly indistinguishable from independently and uniformly drawn <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p}</span> elements as desired. ∎</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Again, the first, standard step is to substitute the tweakable PRF with its ideal cousin, the tweakable URF <span class="math">\\widetilde{\\mathsf{R}}</span>, throughout, incurring the same term as in the bound above.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With the tweakable URF in place, Minematsu’s original security proof consists of a number of steps. Firstly, we only need to consider an adversary making a single forgery attempt using the decryption oracle, so <span class="math">q_{v}=1</span>, and then extend it to an arbitrary number of decryptions using a standard guessing argument <em>[x10]</em>. Furthermore, without loss of generality, we may assume that <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span> makes all its encryption queries before the final decryption query.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We denote the adversary’s forgery attempt by <span class="math">(N^{\\prime},\\mathbf{c}^{\\prime},\\mathsf{Tag}^{\\prime})</span>. For the forgery to be counted, it needs to be fresh, that is <span class="math">(N^{\\prime},\\mathbf{c}^{\\prime},\\mathsf{Tag}^{\\prime})\\neq(N_{j},\\mathbf{c}_{j},\\mathsf{Tag}_{j})</span> for all encryption queries <span class="math">j\\in[1,\\ldots,q]</span>. As for each nonce and ciphertext vector there is one unique valid tag (by inspection of the decryption algorithm), we in fact need that <span class="math">(N^{\\prime},\\mathbf{c}^{\\prime})\\neq(N_{j}\\mathbf{c}_{j})</span> for all <span class="math">j</span>. For the forgery attempt <span class="math">(N^{\\prime},\\mathbf{c}^{\\prime})</span>, we will use <span class="math">\\mathsf{Tag}^{<em>}</span> to denote the unique valid tag corresponding to it, whereas for all internal variables related to <span class="math">(N^{\\prime},\\mathbf{c}^{\\prime})</span> we will use a prime, for instance <span class="math">m_{1}^{\\prime}</span> for the first tentative message block and <span class="math">\\Sigma^{\\prime}</span> for the unique input (used by decryption) to the tweakable URF that produces <span class="math">\\mathsf{Tag}^{</em>}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The adversary’s advantage is upper bounded by the maximum probability it can find a forgery <span class="math">(N^{\\prime},\\mathbf{c}^{\\prime},\\mathsf{Tag}^{\\prime})</span> given an transcript of encryption queries <span class="math">\\{(N_{j},\\mathbf{m}_{j},\\mathbf{c}_{j},T_{j})\\},j\\in[1,\\ldots,q]</span>. Here the maximum is over all possible transcript and the probability is over the ‘residual’ randomness of the tweakable URF, that is to sample the tweakable URF on values that are needed to evaluate <span class="math">\\mathsf{Tag}^{*}</span> and have not yet been sampled during the encryption queries. As is customary, at this stage we can restrict to deterministic, computationally unbounded adversaries.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Dragos Rotaru, Nigel P. Smart and Martijn Stam</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To upper bound this maximum probability <span class="math">\\mathsf{FP}_{\\mathbf{z}}</span>, we will consider four cases (down from the original's 13): the forgery uses a fresh nonce; the forgery uses a nonce for an encryption query and matches the even message length; the forgery uses a past nonce and matches the odd message length; and finally the forgery uses a past nonce, but using a different message length.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Case 1: <span class="math">N&#x27; \\neq N_j</span> for all <span class="math">j \\in [1, \\ldots, q]</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this case, during decryption the tweak is fresh and hence the <span class="math">\\mathsf{Tag}^*</span> will be an independent, uniformly random value, so the probability that <span class="math">\\mathsf{Tag}&#x27;</span> is correct satisfies <span class="math">\\mathsf{FP}_{\\mathbf{z}} = 1 / p</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Dragos Rotaru, Nigel P. Smart and Martijn Stam</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">whereas throughput gives the maximum number of executions which can be done in parallel. The experiments were ran between two machines each with Intel i7-4790 CPUs running at 3.60GHz, 16GB of RAM connected through a LAN network of 1Gbps with an average ping of 0.3ms (roundtrip) and implemented using the SPDZ software <span class="math">^2</span> . WAN experiments were simulated using Linux tc tool with an average ping latency of 100ms (roundtrip). To give precise timings, each experiment was averaged with at least 5 executions where each execution authenticated at least 1000 messages. We choose to exclude the times in the online phase for computing the key dependent pre-processing such as  <span class="math">\\mathsf{E_k}(0)</span>  or  <span class="math">\\mathsf{E_k}(1)</span>  since this is done just once before the start of authentication.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 2 contains the preprocessing costs for encryption (similar costs apply for decryption). For this we counted the number of triples and bits required to evaluate each mode of operation instantiated with different PRF's, these costs are given in terms of the message length  <span class="math">\\ell</span> ; i.e. the number of finite field elements being encrypted. For Leg we assume a finite field size of  <span class="math">p \\approx 2^{128}</span> , where  <span class="math">p</span>  is chosen such that we can select  <span class="math">L = 128</span>  in the construction of the Leg PRF. The amount of data sent per party and computational cost is estimated, in the table, using the currently best-known method for producing triples and bits in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  with active security [KOS16]. According to [KOS16] bits and triples have the same cost in arithmetic circuits  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  so we merge the costs into one column which is called Triples. As expected, OTR has a lower preprocessing cost, than using CTR+pPMAC, since the number of PRF calls is reduced by half compared to pPMAC. Whilst CTR+HtMAC is slightly better than OTR in terms of pre-processing costs.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Table 5 we present the online costs, as a function of  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  for our various constructions. For each variant we give the number of rounds and the number of openings. As we have selected highly parallel modes of operation, the round complexity does not depend on the message length. Intuitively, the online round complexity should define the latency of a protocol and the online opening complexity should define the throughput. However, due to the nature of actual physical networks we expect that as soon as we reach the maximum capacity of the network, in terms of data sent (i.e. openings) per round, the latency will drop off rapidly. Thus as  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  increases we expect to see an increase in latency, despite latency "theoretically" being a constant. The key question is then how big does  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  need to be before the latency for a specific PRF and mode decreases linearly in  <span class="math">\\ell</span> ?</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To investigate this potential drop off in latency we carried out experiments in the LAN setting, the results of which are detailed in Figure 18 (for small messages) and Figure 19 (for long messages for the MiMC PRF). We see that despite ciphers based on the Leg PRF having lower round complexity, this does not translate into low latency as soon as the size of  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  increases. For small values of  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  we do benefit from using Leg, but not for larger values. This is because we reach network capacity for only a few parallel calls to Leg; as evaluating the PRF itself takes up a lot of network capacity. On the other hand</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Dragos Rotaru, Nigel P. Smart and Martijn Stam</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">with MiMC we require more rounds, but in each round we need to send much less data, so even as  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  increases the latency does not increase that much. Eventually we see that for large messages MiMC ends up having the same growth as we experience with Leg for smaller messages.</p>

In this and in other figures in this section: OTR is marked in blue, CTR+pMAC is marked in red, and CTR+Hash-then-MAC is marked in Green. Use of the Leg PRF is marked with a dot on the line, and use of the MiMC PRF is marked with a cross.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Figure 20 and Figure 21 we examine throughput for both Leg and MiMC in the LAN setting. Not surprisingly for all options throughput decreases as  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  increases, and we get a better throughput if we select MiMC and use the CTR+HtMAC cipher. Indeed contrary to the conclusion in  <span class="math">[\\mathrm{GRR}^{+}16]</span>  we conclude that MiMC is better than Leg for both throughput and latency. The primary reason for this conclusion is that, unlike the</p>

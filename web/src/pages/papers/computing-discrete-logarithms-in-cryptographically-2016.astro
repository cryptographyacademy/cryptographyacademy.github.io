    <p class="text-gray-300">ABSTRACT. Since 2013 there have been several developments in algorithms for computing discrete logarithms in small-characteristic finite fields, culminating in a quasi-polynomial algorithm. In this paper, we report on our successful computation of discrete logarithms in the cryptographically-interesting characteristic-three finite field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6.509}}</span>  using these new algorithms; prior to 2013, it was believed that this field enjoyed a security level of 128 bits. We also show that a recent idea of Guillevic can be used to compute discrete logarithms in the cryptographically-interesting finite field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6.709}}</span>  using essentially the same resources as we expended on the  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6.509}}</span>  computation. Finally, we argue that discrete logarithms in the finite field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6.1429}}</span>  can feasibly be computed today; this is significant because this cryptographically-interesting field was previously believed to enjoy a security level of 192 bits.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-1" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">1. Introduction</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  denote a finite field of order q. The discrete logarithm problem (DLP) in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  is the following: given an element  <span class="math">g \\in \\mathbb{F}_q^*</span>  of order r, and  <span class="math">h \\in \\langle g \\rangle</span> , find the integer  <span class="math">x \\in [0, r-1]</span>  such that  <span class="math">h = g^x</span> . The integer x is called the discrete logarithm of h to the base g and is denoted by  <span class="math">\\log_g h</span> . Before 2013, the fastest general-purpose algorithm known for solving the DLP in the case where q is a prime was the Number Field Sieve [21, 35] with running time  <span class="math">L_q[\\frac{1}{3}, 1.923]</span> , and the fastest general-purpose algorithm known for solving the DLP in the case where q is a power of 2 or 3 was Coppersmith's algorithm [13] with running time  <span class="math">L_q[\\frac{1}{3}, 1.526]</span> . Here,  <span class="math">L_q[\\alpha, c]</span>  with  <span class="math">0 &lt; \\alpha &lt; 1</span>  and c &gt; 0 denotes the expression</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\exp\\left((c+o(1))(\\log q)^{\\alpha}(\\log\\log q)^{1-\\alpha}\\right)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">that is subexponential in  <span class="math">\\log q</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since the DLP in small-characteristic fields was a little easier than the DLP in prime-order fields, the vast majority of early research and development of discrete-logarithm cryptographic protocols used prime-order fields. This situation changed at the beginning of the present century with the introduction of pairing-based cryptography (see [10]), which employs non-degenerate bilinear pairings derived from elliptic curves and genus-2 hyperelliptic curves. In particular, some influential early papers [11, 17, 8, 18, 7] considered symmetric pairings  <span class="math">e: \\mathbb{G} \\times \\mathbb{G} \\to \\mathbb{G}_T</span>  derived from supersingular elliptic curves E and genus-2 hyperelliptic curves C defined over finite fields  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  of characteristic 2 or 3. Here,  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}</span>  is a subgroup of prime-order r of  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span> , the group of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> -rational points on E, or of  <span class="math">\\mathrm{Jac}_C(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span> , the jacobian of C over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> ;  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_T</span>  is the order-r subgroup of the multiplicative group of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}</span> ;</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Date: September 20, 2016.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and the embedding degree k is the smallest positive integer such that  <span class="math">r \\mid (q^k - 1)</span> . Three symmetric pairings that were widely studied and implemented are:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>(1) the k=6 pairings derived from supersingular elliptic curves  <span class="math">Y^2=X^3-X+1</span>  and  <span class="math">Y^2=X^3-X-1</span>  over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  with  <span class="math">q=3^n</span> ;</li>
      <li>(2) the k=4 pairings derived from supersingular elliptic curves  <span class="math">Y^2+Y=X^3+X</span>  and  <span class="math">Y^2+Y=X^3+X+1</span>  over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  with  <span class="math">q=2^n</span> ;</li>
      <li>(3) the k=12 pairings derived from supersingular genus-2 curves  <span class="math">Y^2+Y=X^5+X^3</span>  and  <span class="math">Y^2+Y=X^5+X^3+1</span>  over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  with  <span class="math">q=2^n</span> .</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In all cases, n is chosen to be a prime such that  <span class="math">\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span>  or  <span class="math">\\#Jac_C(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span>  is divisible by a large prime r. A necessary condition for the security of these pairings is the intractability of the DLP in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_T</span> , and thus also in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}</span>  [34, 16]. Consequently, the DLP in such finite fields  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6n}}</span> ,  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{4n}}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{12n}}</span>  became especially important from a cryptographic point of view; we will henceforth say that these fields are 'cryptographically interesting'.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In 2013, there were several spectacular developments in algorithms for computing discrete logarithms in small-characteristic finite fields, culminating in a quasi-polynomial time algorithm [26, 19, 6]. These developments were accompanied by some striking computational results such as the computation of discrete logarithms in the 6120-bit field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{8\\cdot 3\\cdot 255}}</span>  in only 550 CPU hours [20]; see [29] for a complete list. In 2014, Granger, Kleinjung and Zumbrägel [22] reported the first computation of discrete logarithms in one of the cryptographically-interesting finite fields  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6n}}</span> ,  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{4n}}</span> ,  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{12n}}</span>  that was believed to offer 128 bits of security against Coppersmith's attack, namely the 4404-bit field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{12\\cdot 367}}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">q=3^6</span> . In this paper, we shall focus on the DLP in cryptographically-interesting fields  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^n}=\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6n}}</span> . In [3] and [4], Adj et al. showed that the new algorithms can in principle be used to compute logarithms in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot509}}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot1429}}</span>  in  <span class="math">2^{81\\cdot7}M_{q^2}</span>  and  <span class="math">2^{95\\cdot8}M_{q^2}</span>  time, respectively, where  <span class="math">M_{q^2}</span>  denotes the time to perform one multiplication in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}</span> . These results were cryptographically significant because the fields  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot509}}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot1429}}</span>  were believed to offer 128 and 192 bits of security against Coppersmith's attack (see [31]). However, the computations were still infeasible using existing computer technology. Then, in [5], Adj et al. used ideas from [28] and [22] to improve their estimates for discrete logarithm computations in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot509}}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot1429}}</span>  to  <span class="math">2^{58.9}M_q</span>  and  <span class="math">2^{78.8}M_{q^2}</span> , respectively, where  <span class="math">M_q</span>  denotes the time to perform one multiplication in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In §3, we describe our computation of discrete logarithms in the 4841-bit field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot509}}</span> . This is the second computation of discrete logarithms in a cryptographically-interesting finite field that was purported to provide 128 bits of security against Coppersmith's attack. Then, in §4, we show that a recent idea of Guillevic [25] can be used to compute discrete logarithms in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot709}}</span>  using essentially the same resources as we expended on the  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot509}}</span>  computation. Furthermore, in §5 we lower the estimates for discrete logarithm computations in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot1429}}</span>  to  <span class="math">2^{63\\cdot4}M_q</span> . We argue that this computation is feasible today, even though it is just beyond the reach of the computer resources available to the authors of this paper. This is the first demonstration that pairing-based cryptosystems originally believed to offer 192 bits of security can be broken in practice today.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We begin in §2 by providing an overview of the key ingredients in the DLP algorithm.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2. Overview of the DLP algorithm</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the sake of concreteness, we focus on DLP instances in cryptographically-interesting finite fields  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6n}}</span> . Let  <span class="math">q=3^6</span>  and let n be prime. Let r be a large prime divisor of  <span class="math">3^n \\pm \\sqrt{3^{n+1}} + 1</span> , whence  <span class="math">r \\mid (q^n - 1)</span> . Let g be a generator of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^n}^*</span> , and let h be an element of the order-r subgroup of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^n}^*</span> . We wish to determine  <span class="math">x = \\log_q h \\mod r</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The elements of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^n}</span>  are represented as polynomials of degree at most n-1 over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> . The algorithm begins by building a factor base of logarithms of all degree-one, degree-two and degree-three polynomials over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> , and a proportion of degree-four polynomials. Then, in the descent stage, various techniques are used to recursively express  <span class="math">\\log_g h</span>  as a linear combination of logarithms of smaller-degree polynomials until all these polynomials belong to the factor base.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Notation.</strong>  <span class="math">N_q(m,n)</span>  denotes the number of monic m-smooth degree-n polynomials in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q[X]</span> , and  <span class="math">S_q(m,d)</span>  denotes the cost of testing m-smoothness of a degree-d polynomial in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q[X]</span> . Formulas for  <span class="math">N_q(m,n)</span>  and  <span class="math">S_q(m,n)</span>  are given in [3] and [23], respectively.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">2.1. <strong>Frobenius representation.</strong> Let  <span class="math">h_0, h_1 \\in \\mathbb{F}_q[X]</span>  be polynomials such that  <span class="math">h_1X^q - h_0</span>  has a degree-n irreducible factor  <span class="math">I_X</span>  in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q[X]</span>  and  <span class="math">\\max(\\deg h_0, \\deg h_1) = 2</span> . The field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^n}</span>  is represented as  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q[X]/(I_X)</span> .

      <li>2.2. <strong>Small degrees.</strong> We use the Joux-Pierrot [28] method for computing logarithms of small-degree polynomials. The main idea is to partition the set of irreducible cubics and quartics into smaller families, and to exploit the special form of  <span class="math">h_0</span>  and  <span class="math">h_1</span>  to find relations of logarithms of elements within a family. The Joux-Pierrot method requires that  <span class="math">h_0</span>  and  <span class="math">h_1</span>  have the form  <span class="math">h_0(X) = \\alpha_0 X + \\alpha_1</span>  and  <span class="math">h_1(X) = X^2 + \\alpha_2 X</span> .</li>
      <li>2.2.1. Linear and quadratic polynomials. The dominant cost of finding logarithms of elements in  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_2</span> , the set of all linear and irreducible quadratic polynomials over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> , is the solution of a linear system of size  <span class="math">\\approx q^2/2 \\times q^2/2</span>  and row density  <span class="math">\\approx 3q/2</span> . The linear system can be solved using Wiedemann's algorithm [36] at a cost of approximately  <span class="math">9q^5/8A_r</span> , where  <span class="math">A_r</span>  denotes the cost of an addition modulo the integer r.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;</li>
      <li>2.2.2. Cubic polynomials. The set  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_3</span>  of irreducible cubics over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  is partitioned into q-1 families  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{3,\\gamma} = \\{X^3 + aX^2 + bX + \\gamma\\}</span> , each of size exactly  <span class="math">(q^2 + q)/3</span> . The dominant cost of finding logarithms of polynomials in a family  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{3,\\gamma}</span>  is the solution of a linear system of size  <span class="math">\\approx q^2/3 \\times q^2/3</span>  and row density  <span class="math">\\approx q/3</span> ; the total cost of solving the q-1 linear systems is  <span class="math">\\approx q^6/9A_r</span> . Note that the q-1 linear systems can be generated and solved independently of each other.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&lt;sup&gt;&amp;&lt;/sup&gt;lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;The dominant cost of Wiedemann's algorithm for solving an  <span class="math">N \\times N</span>  system of linear equations with row density  <span class="math">\\lambda</span>  and where the nonzero entries are small (e.g.,  <span class="math">0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2</span> ) is  <span class="math">3\\lambda N^2 A_r</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">2.2.3. Quartic polynomials. The irreducible quartics over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  are partitioned into q-1 families  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{4,\\gamma} = \\{X^4 + aX^3 + bX^2 + \\delta X + \\gamma\\}</span> , each of size approximately  <span class="math">q^3/4</span> . Each family  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{4,\\gamma}</span>  is further partitioned into q subfamilies  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{4,\\gamma,\\delta}</span>  according to the coefficient  <span class="math">\\delta</span>  of the linear term in a polynomial; we have  <span class="math">|\\mathcal{B}_{4,\\gamma,\\delta}| \\approx q^2/4</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To compute logarithms of all quartics Q in a subfamily  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{4,\\gamma,\\delta}</span> , one first attempts a 4-to-3 Gröbner bases descent on Q (see §2.5). This is expected to be successful about 50% of the time. If unsuccessful, then the 'Frobenius strategy' described in [5] is employed. Namely, one has</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\tilde{Q}(X) = h_1^4 Q(X^q) = h_1^4 Q(h_0/h_1) = h_0^4 + ah_0^3 h_1 + bh_0^2 h_1^2 + \\delta h_0 h_1^3 + \\gamma h_1^4.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The polynomial  <span class="math">\\tilde{Q}</span>  is either irreducible or a product of two irreducible quartics, the latter occurring with probability&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; approximately  <span class="math">\\frac{1}{2}</span>  (see Lemma 2 in [28]). In the latter case, a 4-to-3 Gröbner bases/Frobenius descent is recursively attempted on each of the two quartic factors of  <span class="math">\\tilde{Q}</span> . If both are successful, then we have succeeded in descending Q.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">About 58.6% of all quartics Q can be descended in this way [28]. Thus, one expects there to be  <span class="math">(1-0.586) \\cdot q^2/4 \\leq 0.11q^2</span>  quartics in  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{4,\\gamma,\\delta}</span>  whose logarithms are yet to be determined. The Joux-Pierrot technique is then used to generate relations of logarithms of these quartics, yielding a linear system of size  <span class="math">\\approx 0.11q^2 \\times 0.11q^2</span>  and row density  <span class="math">\\approx 0.11q</span> . The  <span class="math">0.00399q^5A_r</span>  cost of solving this linear system dominates the cost of computing logarithms of all polynomials in a subfamily. Thus, the cost of computing logarithms of all polynomials in a family is  <span class="math">0.00399q^6A_r</span> , and the cost of computing logarithms of all quartics is  <span class="math">0.00399q^7A_r</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that the q(q-1) linear systems can be generated and solved independently of each other. While sacrificing some parallelizability, Joux and Pierrot [28] described how the linear systems associated with families can be recursively halved in dimension using the family-based Gröbner bases descent method described in §2.2.4. With this modification, the dominant cost of computing logarithms of irreducible quartics is the cost of the linear algebra for the first few of the q-1 families.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">2.2.4. Family-based Gröbner bases descent for quartics. To avoid the high storage and lookup costs for the factor base of logarithms of all  <span class="math">(q^4 - q^2)/4</span>  irreducible quartics, one can instead compute and store the logarithms of quartics in a relatively small number of families, say  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{4,\\gamma_i}</span>  for  <span class="math">i=1,2,\\ldots,s</span> . Suppose that  <span class="math">Q\\in\\mathbb{F}_q[X]</span>  is an irreducible quartic that is not in one of these s families. Then  <span class="math">\\log_q Q</span>  can be computed on-the-fly as follows.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We first attempt a 4-to-3 Gröbner bases descent and the Frobenius strategy on Q. If this fails, we consider the first family  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{4,\\gamma_1}</span> . Our goal is to find polynomials  <span class="math">k_1(X) = X^4 + a_2X^2 + a_1X + \\gamma_1</span>  and  <span class="math">k_2(X) = X^3 + b_2X^2 + b_1X \\in \\mathbb{F}_q[X]</span>  such that  <span class="math">Q \\mid G</span> , where</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$G = h_1^4(k_1^q k_2 - k_1 k_2^q) \\bmod I_X.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this case, we have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&lt;sup&gt;&amp;&lt;/sup&gt;lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;All statements in this paper about probability are heuristic, and assume that polynomials generated in the course of the algorithm are distributed uniformly at random from a certain set of polynomials.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">as can be seen by making the substitution  <span class="math">Y \\mapsto k_1/k_2</span>  into the systematic equation</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$Y^q - Y = \\prod_{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{F}_q} (Y - \\alpha)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and clearing denominators. It is clear that all the irreducible quartics appearing in the right side of (1) are  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{4,\\gamma_1}</span> -elements. Note that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">which is a degree-11 polynomial divisible by  <span class="math">X(h_1X - h_0)</span>  and Q. The cofactor of  <span class="math">X \\cdot (h_1X - h_0) \\cdot Q</span>  in G is a degree-3 polynomial. Thus, equation (1) yields an expression for  <span class="math">\\log_g Q</span>  in terms of logarithms of polynomials of degree  <span class="math">\\leq 3</span>  and polynomials in  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{4,\\gamma_1}</span> . Since these logarithms are all known, we can determine  <span class="math">\\log_g Q</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To find polynomials  <span class="math">(k_1, k_2)</span>  such that  <span class="math">Q \\mid G</span> , one proceeds as in the classical Gröbner bases descent (see §2.5), with the same computational cost, whereby a system of multivariate bilinear equations is solved using a Gröbner basis finding algorithm.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As discussed in §2.2.3, this descent method, together with the Frobenius strategy, is successful for only about 58.6% of all irreducible quadratics Q not in  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{4,\\gamma_1}</span> . If the descent fails, then the procedure is iterated with the other families  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{4,\\gamma_i}</span>  for  <span class="math">i=2,\\ldots,s</span> . The probability that the descent fails after s iterations is  <span class="math">(1-0.586)^{s+1}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">2.3. Continued-fractions descent. Suppose that  <span class="math">\\deg h = n-1</span> . The descent begins by multiplying h by a random power of g. The extended Euclidean algorithm is used to express the resulting field element h' in the form  <span class="math">h&#x27; = w_1/w_2</span>  where  <span class="math">\\deg w_1, \\deg w_2 \\approx n/2</span>  [9]. This process is repeated until both  <span class="math">w_1</span>  and  <span class="math">w_2</span>  are m-smooth for some chosen m &lt; (n-1)/2, thus giving  <span class="math">\\log_h h</span>  as a linear combination of logarithms of polynomials of degree at most m. The expected cost of this continued-fractions descent is approximately</p>

The total execution time was 379, 142 CPU hours.

We elected not to used the technique of iteratively decreasing the size of the corresponding linear systems. Consequently, each subfamily of quartics yielded a linear system of dimension approximately 55,050. The total relation generation running time was 35,118 CPU hours using Magma on Intel Xeon E5-2650 v2 2.60GHz CPU cores.

Each linear system was solved in parallel on 2 cores. We used approximately 5000 cores to solve all 21,141 linear systems. The logarithms of a family were stored in files whose total size is 20.4 gigabytes. The total size of the files of factor base logarithms is 618 gigabytes.

Using this result, we computed the expected number of degree-4 elements obtained after a descent of a polynomial of degree in the interval [5,15]. We then used Table 4 to estimate the expected number of irreducible quartics that result from all the descent steps. These estimates are shown in Table 2; the total number of irreducible quartics is  <span class="math">2^{31.15}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To compute the logarithm of a polynomial in  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{4,u^i}</span> , i &gt; 28, we used the family-based descent method described in §2.2.4. The descent considered the families in the order  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_3</span> ,  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{4,u^0}</span> ,  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{4,u^1}</span> ,..., <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{4,u^{28}}</span> . Table 3 shows, for each  <span class="math">i \\in [0,28]</span> , the inverse of the probability that a randomly-selected irreducible quartic descends based on that family. In particular, note that the probability that a quartic fails to descend is less than  <span class="math">2^{-38.2}</span> . Since the reciprocal of the failure probability is  <span class="math">\\gg 2^{31.15}</span> , the number of quartics encountered that fail to descend is expected to be very small. In the event that a quartic fails to descent, the computation that yielded that quartic is repeated (with different parameters).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The computers available to us had at most 256 gigabytes of RAM. Thus, only the logarithms of the cubics and the logarithms of the first 10 quartics families  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{4,u^0}</span> ,  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{4,u^1}</span> , ...,  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{4,u^9}</span>  were placed in RAM, and the logarithms of the remaining quartic families were stored in hard disk (HD), which is much slower to access than virtual memory (VM). Since many copies of the Magma code will be executed in parallel, each of which will be accessing the same logarithm files, the memory accesses have to be carefully scheduled to avoid traffic congestion. In addition, we had to deal with some restrictions on Magma's file reading capabilities (for example, whether the files are stored in hexadecimal encoding or binary</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 4. Number of polynomials of each degree in the interval [5, 15] obtained after the continued-fractions and classical descents. The total number of polynomials is 1409.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">3.2.6. Small-degree descent. In the last descent stage, the 1409 polynomials of degrees in [5, 15] that resulted from the continued-fractions and classical descents should have their logarithms expressed in terms of logarithms of elements in the factor base, namely, in B2, B&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and B4,u&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; , i ∈ [0, 28].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The Gröbner bases descent expresses the logarithm of a degree-D element,  <span class="math">D \\in [5, 15]</span> , as a linear combination of logarithms of polynomials of degree  <span class="math">\\leq d</span>  where  <span class="math">d = \\lfloor D/2 \\rfloor + 2</span> . This is the best that can be done because of condition (5).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Gröbner bases descent was used on polynomials of odd degree. For those of even degree the zigzag descent was employed (except for degree-14 polynomials, see below) because of its more aggressive descent character. Indeed, a polynomial of degree 2d, d &gt; 2, is related with polynomials of degree d using the zigzag descent instead of polynomials of degree d+2 when using the Gröbner bases descent. The degree-4 polynomials which are not in the factor base are descended using the classical or family-based Gröbner bases descent combined with the Frobenius strategy.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As mentioned in §2.6, the zigzag descent is successful for only 50% of degree-6 polynomials. For the remainder, we used a hybrid Gröbner bases-zigzag descent. In this hybrid descent, a degree-6 polynomial is lifted to the quadratic extension of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{36}</span> , where it splits into two cubics. Over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{12}}</span> , we adapted the Gröbner bases descent in §2.5 and used it to perform a 3-to-2 descent on one of the two degree-3 polynomials. Then, using the polynomial norm as in §2.6, we obtained the logarithm of the degree-6 polynomial expressed in term of logarithms of polynomials of degree (at most) 4. This strategy allowed us to avoid the more costly 6-to-5 and then 5-to-4 Gröbner bases descent steps (recall that each of these descents has a branching factor of q).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We also employed the hybrid descent on the degree-14 polynomials to perform 14-to-8 descents instead of zigzag 14-to-7 descents. In fact, a complete descent is more costly on a degree-7 polynomial than on a degree-8 polynomial since in the former two Gröbner bases descent stages, 7-to-5 then 5-to-4, are needed whereas only one zigzag 8-to-4 descent stage is needed in the latter.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">TABLE 5. Total and average CPU times in seconds to obtain the logarithms of all the polynomials of degrees in [5, 15] that resulted from the continued-fractions and classical descents. The times assume that an Intel Xeon E5-2658 v2 2.40 GHz machine with 256 gigabytes of RAM is used.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 1. In hindsight, the total running time for computing logarithms in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot509}}</span>  can be reduced substantially with two modifications to the algorithm. First, as mentioned at the end of §2.2.3, the linear systems associated with families of quartics can be reduced after discrete logarithms of a few families have been computed. Second, a 508-to-32 Guillevic descent (see §4.1) could be used instead of the 508-to-40 continued-fractions descent. The estimated cost of the 508-to-32 Guillevic descent is only 0.05 CPU years as compared to the estimated cost of 31.8 CPU years for the 508-to-40 continued-fractions descent. Moreover, the estimated costs of the subsequent 32-to-19 and 19-to-15 classical descents</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and the 15-to-4 small-degree descents are also substantially lower — 0.93, 0.99 and 2.13 CPU years, respectively (cf. Table 1).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Recall that the Frobenius representation of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6n}}</span>  requires a degree-n irreducible factor of  <span class="math">h_1(X) \\cdot X^q - h_0(X)</span>  over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  where  <span class="math">\\max(\\deg h_0, \\deg h_1) = 2</span> . Now, n = 709 is the largest prime  <span class="math">\\leq 731</span>  for which there is a supersingular elliptic curve E over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^n}</span>  with  <span class="math">r = \\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{3^n})</span>  a prime. More precisely, we have  <span class="math">r = 3^{709} - 3^{355} + 1 = \\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{3^{709}})</span>  where E is the supersingular elliptic curve  <span class="math">Y^2 = X^3 - X - 1</span>  defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_3</span> . The Weil and Tate pairings can be used to embed  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_{3^{709}})</span>  in the multiplicative group of the 6743-bit field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot709}}</span> . Thus, we are interested in computing  <span class="math">x = \\log_g h \\mod r</span> , where g is a generator of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot709}}^*</span>  and h is an element of the order-r subgroup of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot709}}^*</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In §4.1 we describe a slight modification of a descent method proposed by Guillevic [25] that is considerably more effective than the continued-fractions descent. Then, in §4.2, we demonstrate that Guillevic's descent method can be utilized to compute discrete logarithms in the cryptographically-interesting field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot709}}</span>  with essentially the same resources as we expended on the  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot509}}</span>  discrete logarithm computation. Thus, we conclude that discrete logarithms in the cryptographically-interesting field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot709}}</span>  can be feasibly computed today.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">4.1. <strong>Guillevic descent.</strong> Let  <span class="math">q=3^6</span>  and let r be a prime divisor of  <span class="math">\\Phi_6(3^n)</span> , where  <span class="math">\\Phi_6(X)</span>  denotes the 6th cyclotomic polynomial. Suppose that elements of the finite field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^n}</span>  are represented as polynomials of degree at most n-1 over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> , with multiplication performed modulo a degree-n irreducible polynomial. Let g be a generator of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^n}^*</span> , and let  <span class="math">h \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q^n}^*</span> . We wish to determine  <span class="math">x = \\log_q h \\mod r</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since h is an arbitrary element of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^n}^*</span> , its degree can be as high as n-1. Without loss of generality, we can suppose that h has degree exactly n-1. Guillevic observed that if h' = hv, where v is an element of the proper subfield  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{3n}}</span>  of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^n}</span> , then</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\log_g h&#x27; \\equiv \\log_g h \\pmod{r}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Her descent method consists of searching for v until h' has degree  <span class="math">n&#x27; \\approx n/2</span>  and is smooth with respect to some smoothness bound m.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">n&#x27; = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor + c</span> , where c is chosen so that  <span class="math">3^{6n&#x27;-3n} \\gg q^{n&#x27;}/N_q(m,n&#x27;)</span> , the right hand side of the inequality being the reciprocal of the proportion of degree-n' polynomials over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  that are m-smooth. Let  <span class="math">\\{1, w, w^2, ..., w^{3n-1}\\}</span>  be a basis for  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{3n}}</span>  over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_3</span> . Thus, we can write  <span class="math">v = v_0 + v_1w + \\cdots + v_{3n-1}w^{3n-1}</span> , where  <span class="math">v_i \\in \\mathbb{F}_3</span> . Let H be the  <span class="math">6n \\times 3n</span>  matrix over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_3</span>  whose columns are the coefficients of  <span class="math">h, wh, w^2h, ..., w^{3n-1}h</span> . Here, if  <span class="math">w^ih = h_0 + h_1X + \\cdots + h_{n-1}X^{n-1}</span>  with  <span class="math">h_j \\in \\mathbb{F}_q</span> , then the column vector corresponding to  <span class="math">w^ih</span>  is  <span class="math">(h_0, h_1, ..., h_{n-1})</span>  where each  <span class="math">h_j</span>  is written as a length-6 vector over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_3</span> . Thus, we wish to find vectors v such that h' = Hv is an  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_3</span> -vector corresponding to a monic polynomial of degree n' over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Now, let H' be the  <span class="math">6(n-n&#x27;) \\times 3n</span>  matrix consisting of the last 6(n-n') rows of H. We expect that H' has full row rank (otherwise we can randomize h and repeat). Thus, each of the  <span class="math">3^{6n&#x27;-3n}</span>  solutions v to the matrix equation H'v = e, with e being the unit vector having a 1 in it first position, yields a monic polynomial h' = Hv of degree n' over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> . These polynomials are tested for m-smoothness until an m-smooth polynomial is found.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The expected running time is  <span class="math">S_q(m, n&#x27;) \\cdot q^{n&#x27;}/N_q(m, n&#x27;)</span> , the cost of the linear algebra being negligible.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As proof-of-concept, we used the new descent method to write a degree-708 polynomial  <span class="math">h \\in \\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot709}}</span>  in terms of a 52-smooth degree-358 monic polynomial h' (so n=709, c=4, n'=358, and m=52). The estimated cost of finding such an h' is only  <span class="math">2^{43\\cdot8}M_q</span> . We found a 52-smooth h' in about 245 CPU hours, after testing about  <span class="math">2^{19.6}</span>  candidates h' (the search was implemented in Magma using a sub-optimal procedure for smoothness testing). In contrast, the expected cost of continued-fractions descent to write h as  <span class="math">w_1/w_2</span>  where each  <span class="math">w_i</span>  is 52-smooth and has degree approximately 354 is  <span class="math">2^{62\\cdot5}M_q</span> ; this computation is feasible but only with a considerable effort.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">4.2. <strong>Estimates.</strong> Let  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^6} = \\mathbb{F}_3[u]/(u^6 + 2u^4 + u^2 + 2u + 2)</span> ,  <span class="math">h_0(X) = u^{10}X + 1</span> , and  <span class="math">h_1(X) = X^2 + u^{110}X</span> . Then  <span class="math">h_1(X) \\cdot X^q - h_0(X)</span>  has a degree-709 irreducible factor  <span class="math">I_X</span> , and the cofactor is an irreducible polynomial of degree 22. The field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot709}}</span>  can be represented as  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^6}[X]/(I_X)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To find  <span class="math">x = \\log_g h \\mod r</span> , we first use Guillevic's descent to find a degree-358 monic polynomial h' that is 40-smooth. The expected cost of this step is  <span class="math">2^{53.3}M_q</span> . (In contrast, the expected cost of continued-fractions descent to express h as the ratio of two 40-smooth degree-354 polynomials is  <span class="math">2^{81.3}M_q</span> .) Thus, the expected cost of the 708-to-40 Guillevic descent is less than the expected cost of the 508-to-40 continued-fractions descent. Furthermore, the 709-to-40 Guillevic descent will yield fewer polynomials of degree  <span class="math">\\leq</span>  40 than the 508-to-40 continued-fractions descent.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The remainder of the discrete logarithm computation in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot709}}</span>  proceeds in the same way as the  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot509}}</span>  discrete logarithm computation, except that we have to work modulo the 1124-bit prime r instead of an 804-bit prime. The larger r will only have a slight impact on the cost of the linear algebra. Hence, we can conclude that discrete logarithms in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot709}}</span>  can be computed using essentially the same resources as we expended in the  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot509}}</span>  computation.</p>

The Weil and Tate pairings can be used to embed the order-r subgroup of  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_{3^{1429}})</span>  in the multiplicative group of the 13590-bit field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 1429}}</span> . Thus, we are interested in computing  <span class="math">x = \\log_g h \\mod r</span> , where g is a generator of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 1429}}^*</span>  and h is an element of the order-r subgroup of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 1429}}^*</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In §5.1, we show that discrete logarithms in the order-r subgroup of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 1429}}^*</span>  can be computed in time  <span class="math">2^{63\\cdot 4}M_q</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 2. To gauge the accurateness of our  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot1429}}</span>  estimates, we generated estimates for the  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot509}}</span>  computation using the same methodology as for the  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot1429}}</span>  estimates. The cost estimates (in CPU years) for the main steps in the  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot509}}</span>  computation are 15.7 (linear algebra for cubics), 16.4 (linear algebra for 29 families of quartics), 31.8 (continued-fractions descent), 7.4 (first classical descent), 7.9 (second classical descent), and 4.7 (small-degree descent). These estimates compare well with the observed times in Table 1 with the exception of the linear algebra as explained in §3.2.2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We chose 36 quartic families to ensure that the probability of an irreducible quartic failing to descend using the family-based Gröbner bases descent method (see  <span class="math">\\S 2.2.4</span> ) is small. If we precompute logarithms of 36 quartic families, then this failure probability is less than  <span class="math">2^{-47.15}</span> . This can be considered to be sufficiently small since we expect to descend about  <span class="math">2^{36.94}</span>  irreducible quartics during the entire computation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In fact, we only need to compute the logarithms of 18 families of quartics since we then get the logarithms of another 18 families for free.

The estimated size of the files containing logarithms of one family of quartics is 59.2 gigabytes. Thus, the logarithms of cubics and 15 quartic families, whose total size is 926.3 gigabytes, can be stored in shared RAM. Since the family-based Gröbner bases descent can be performed with respect to 30 quartic families without resorting to the quartic families stored in hard disk, we can reasonably expect that the time to compute the logarithm of a randomly-selected irreducible quartic to be no mor than the time for this operation in the  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot509}}</span>  computation (where only 10 quartic families were stored in RAM), namely 0.064 seconds. Since we expect to perform  <span class="math">2^{36\\cdot94}</span>  such descents in total, we obtain an upper bound of 65 days on the time for all the small-degree descents.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The total estimated calendar time for computing a logarithm in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 1429}}</span>  is 173 days.

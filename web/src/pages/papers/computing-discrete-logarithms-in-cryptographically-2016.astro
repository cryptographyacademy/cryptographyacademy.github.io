    <p class="text-gray-300">ABSTRACT. Since 2013 there have been several developments in algorithms for computing discrete logarithms in small-characteristic finite fields, culminating in a quasi-polynomial algorithm. In this paper, we report on our successful computation of discrete logarithms in the cryptographically-interesting characteristic-three finite field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6}\\cdot 509}</span> using these new algorithms; prior to 2013, it was believed that this field enjoyed a security level of 128 bits. We also show that a recent idea of Guillevic can be used to compute discrete logarithms in the cryptographically-interesting finite field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6}\\cdot 709}</span> using essentially the same resources as we expended on the <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6}\\cdot 509}</span> computation. Finally, we argue that discrete logarithms in the finite field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6}\\cdot 1429}</span> can feasibly be computed today; this is significant because this cryptographically-interesting field was previously believed to enjoy a security level of 192 bits.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> denote a finite field of order <span class="math">q</span>. The discrete logarithm problem (DLP) in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> is the following: given an element <span class="math">g \\in \\mathbb{F}_q^*</span> of order <span class="math">r</span>, and <span class="math">h \\in \\langle g \\rangle</span>, find the integer <span class="math">x \\in [0, r-1]</span> such that <span class="math">h = g^x</span>. The integer <span class="math">x</span> is called the discrete logarithm of <span class="math">h</span> to the base <span class="math">g</span> and is denoted by <span class="math">\\log_g h</span>. Before 2013, the fastest general-purpose algorithm known for solving the DLP in the case where <span class="math">q</span> is a prime was the Number Field Sieve [21, 35] with running time <span class="math">L_q[\\frac{1}{3}, 1.923]</span>, and the fastest general-purpose algorithm known for solving the DLP in the case where <span class="math">q</span> is a power of 2 or 3 was Coppersmith's algorithm [13] with running time <span class="math">L_q[\\frac{1}{3}, 1, 526]</span>. Here, <span class="math">L_q[\\alpha, c]</span> with <span class="math">0 &amp;lt; \\alpha &amp;lt; 1</span> and <span class="math">c &amp;gt; 0</span> denotes the expression</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">that is subexponential in <span class="math">\\log q</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since the DLP in small-characteristic fields was a little easier than the DLP in prime-order fields, the vast majority of early research and development of discrete-logarithm cryptographic protocols used prime-order fields. This situation changed at the beginning of the present century with the introduction of pairing-based cryptography (see [10]), which employs non-degenerate bilinear pairings derived from elliptic curves and genus-2 hyperelliptic curves. In particular, some influential early papers [11, 17, 8, 18, 7] considered symmetric pairings <span class="math">e: \\mathbb{G} \\times \\mathbb{G} \\to \\mathbb{G}_T</span> derived from supersingular elliptic curves <span class="math">E</span> and genus-2 hyperelliptic curves <span class="math">C</span> defined over finite fields <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> of characteristic 2 or 3. Here, <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}</span> is a subgroup of prime-order <span class="math">r</span> of <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span>, the group of <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>-rational points on <span class="math">E</span>, or of <span class="math">\\operatorname{Jac}_C(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span>, the jacobian of <span class="math">C</span> over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>; <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_T</span> is the order-<span class="math">r</span> subgroup of the multiplicative group of <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}</span>;</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Date: September 20, 2016.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and the embedding degree <span class="math">k</span> is the smallest positive integer such that <span class="math">r\\mid(q^{k}-1)</span>. Three symmetric pairings that were widely studied and implemented are:</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>the <span class="math">k=6</span> pairings derived from supersingular elliptic curves <span class="math">Y^{2}=X^{3}-X+1</span> and <span class="math">Y^{2}=X^{3}-X-1</span> over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span> with <span class="math">q=3^{n}</span>;</li>

      <li>the <span class="math">k=4</span> pairings derived from supersingular elliptic curves <span class="math">Y^{2}+Y=X^{3}+X</span> and <span class="math">Y^{2}+Y=X^{3}+X+1</span> over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span> with <span class="math">q=2^{n}</span>;</li>

      <li>the <span class="math">k=12</span> pairings derived from supersingular genus-2 curves <span class="math">Y^{2}+Y=X^{5}+X^{3}</span> and <span class="math">Y^{2}+Y=X^{5}+X^{3}+1</span> over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span> with <span class="math">q=2^{n}</span>.</li>

    </ol>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In all cases, <span class="math">n</span> is chosen to be a prime such that <span class="math">\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{q})</span> or <span class="math">\\#\\mathrm{Jac}_{C}(\\mathbb{F}_{q})</span> is divisible by a large prime <span class="math">r</span>. A necessary condition for the security of these pairings is the intractability of the DLP in <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_{T}</span>, and thus also in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}</span> <em>[34, 16]</em>. Consequently, the DLP in such finite fields <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6n}}</span>, <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{4n}}</span> and <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{12n}}</span> became especially important from a cryptographic point of view; we will henceforth say that these fields are ‘cryptographically interesting’.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In 2013, there were several spectacular developments in algorithms for computing discrete logarithms in small-characteristic finite fields, culminating in a quasi-polynomial time algorithm <em>[26, 19, 6]</em>. These developments were accompanied by some striking computational results such as the computation of discrete logarithms in the 6120-bit field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{8\\cdot 3\\cdot 255}}</span> in only 550 CPU hours <em>[20]</em>; see <em>[29]</em> for a complete list. In 2014, Granger, Kleinjung and Zumbrägel <em>[22]</em> reported the first computation of discrete logarithms in one of the cryptographically-interesting finite fields <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6n}}</span>, <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{4n}}</span>, <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{12n}}</span> that was believed to offer 128 bits of security against Coppersmith’s attack, namely the 4404-bit field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{12\\cdot 367}}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">q=3^{6}</span>. In this paper, we shall focus on the DLP in cryptographically-interesting fields <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}=\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6n}}</span>. In <em>[3]</em> and <em>[4]</em>, Adj et al. showed that the new algorithms can in principle be used to compute logarithms in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 509}}</span> and <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 1429}}</span> in <span class="math">2^{81.7}M_{q^{2}}</span> and <span class="math">2^{95.8}M_{q^{2}}</span> time, respectively, where <span class="math">M_{q^{2}}</span> denotes the time to perform one multiplication in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2}}</span>. These results were cryptographically significant because the fields <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 509}}</span> and <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 1429}}</span> were believed to offer 128 and 192 bits of security against Coppersmith’s attack (see <em>[31]</em>). However, the computations were still infeasible using existing computer technology. Then, in <em>[5]</em>, Adj et al. used ideas from <em>[28]</em> and <em>[22]</em> to improve their estimates for discrete logarithm computations in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 509}}</span> and <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 1429}}</span> to <span class="math">2^{58.9}M_{q}</span> and <span class="math">2^{78.8}M_{q^{2}}</span>, respectively, where <span class="math">M_{q}</span> denotes the time to perform one multiplication in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In §3, we describe our computation of discrete logarithms in the 4841-bit field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 509}}</span>. This is the second computation of discrete logarithms in a cryptographically-interesting finite field that was purported to provide 128 bits of security against Coppersmith’s attack. Then, in §4, we show that a recent idea of Guillevic <em>[25]</em> can be used to compute discrete logarithms in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 709}}</span> using essentially the same resources as we expended on the <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 509}}</span> computation. Furthermore, in §5 we lower the estimates for discrete logarithm computations in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 1429}}</span> to <span class="math">2^{63.4}M_{q}</span>. We argue that this computation is feasible today, even though it is just beyond the reach of the computer resources available to the authors of this paper. This is the first demonstration that pairing-based cryptosystems originally believed to offer 192 bits of security can be broken in practice today.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We begin in §2 by providing an overview of the key ingredients in the DLP algorithm.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the sake of concreteness, we focus on DLP instances in cryptographically-interesting finite fields <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6n}}</span>. Let <span class="math">q = 3^6</span> and let <span class="math">n</span> be prime. Let <span class="math">r</span> be a large prime divisor of <span class="math">3^n \\pm \\sqrt{3^{n+1}} + 1</span>, whence <span class="math">r \\mid (q^n - 1)</span>.

The algorithm begins by building a factor base of logarithms of all degree-one, degree-two and degree-three polynomials over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>, and a proportion of degree-four polynomials. Then, in the descent stage, various techniques are used to recursively express <span class="math">\\log_g h</span> as a linear combination of logarithms of smaller-degree polynomials until all these polynomials belong to the factor base.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To compute logarithms of all quartics <span class="math">Q</span> in a subfamily <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{4,\\gamma,\\delta}</span>, one first attempts a 4-to-3 Gröbner bases descent on <span class="math">Q</span> (see §2.5). This is expected to be successful about 50% of the time. If unsuccessful, then the ‘Frobenius strategy’ described in <em>[5]</em> is employed. Namely, one has</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\tilde{Q}(X)=h_{1}^{4}Q(X^{q})=h_{1}^{4}Q(h_{0}/h_{1})=h_{0}^{4}+ah_{0}^{3}h_{1}+bh_{0}^{2}h_{1}^{2}+\\delta h_{0}h_{1}^{3}+\\gamma h_{1}^{4}.</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The polynomial <span class="math">\\tilde{Q}</span> is either irreducible or a product of two irreducible quartics, the latter occurring with probability approximately <span class="math">\\frac{1}{2}</span> (see Lemma 2 in <em>[28]</em>). In the latter case, a 4-to-3 Gröbner bases/Frobenius descent is recursively attempted on each of the two quartic factors of <span class="math">\\tilde{Q}</span>. If both are successful, then we have succeeded in descending <span class="math">Q</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">About 58.6% of all quartics <span class="math">Q</span> can be descended in this way <em>[28]</em>.

The Joux-Pierrot technique is then used to generate relations of logarithms of these quartics, yielding a linear system of size <span class="math">\\approx 0.11q^{2}\\times 0.11q^{2}</span> and row density <span class="math">\\approx 0.11q</span>. The <span class="math">0.00399q^{5}A_{r}</span> cost of solving this linear system dominates the cost of computing logarithms of all polynomials in a subfamily. Thus, the cost of computing logarithms of all polynomials in a family is <span class="math">0.00399q^{6}A_{r}</span>, and the cost of computing logarithms of all quartics is <span class="math">0.00399q^{7}A_{r}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that the <span class="math">q(q-1)</span> linear systems can be generated and solved independently of each other. While sacrificing some parallelizability, Joux and Pierrot <em>[28]</em> described how the linear systems associated with families can be recursively halved in dimension using the family-based Gröbner bases descent method described in §2.2.4. With this modification, the dominant cost of computing logarithms of irreducible quartics is the cost of the linear algebra for the first few of the <span class="math">q-1</span> families.</p>

The total relation generation running time was 35,118 CPU hours using Magma on Intel Xeon E5-2650 v2 2.60GHz CPU cores. The resulting  <span class="math">29 \\times 729 = 21,141</span>  sparse systems of linear equations were solved using our C implementation of Wiedemann's algorithm in 829,573 CPU hours on ABACUS. Each linear system was solved in parallel on 2 cores. We used approximately 5000 cores to solve all 21,141 linear systems. The logarithms of a family were stored in files whose total size is 20.4 gigabytes. The total size of the files of factor base logarithms is 618 gigabytes. Note that the total size of the files for logarithms of all polynomials of degree  <span class="math">\\leq 4</span>  would be about 14.9 terabytes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Theorem 4 of [30] shows that the expected number of degree-  <span class="math">d</span>  irreducible factors of a randomly selected degree-  <span class="math">n</span>  polynomial over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  is approximately  <span class="math">1 / d</span> . Using this result, we computed the expected number of degree-4 elements obtained after a descent of a polynomial of degree in the interval [5, 15]. We then used Table 4 to estimate the expected number of irreducible quartics that result from all the descent steps. These estimates are shown in Table 2; the total number of irreducible quartics is  <span class="math">2^{31.15}</span> .</p>

In the last descent stage, the 1409 polynomials of degrees in [5, 15] that resulted from the continued-fractions and classical descents should have their logarithms expressed in terms of logarithms of elements in the factor base, namely, in  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_2</span> ,  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_3</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{4,u^i}</span> ,  <span class="math">i \\in [0,28]</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">COMPUTING LOGARITHMS IN CHARACTERISTIC-THREE FINITE FIELDS</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The Gröbner bases descent expresses the logarithm of a degree-  <span class="math">D</span>  element,  <span class="math">D \\in [5,15]</span> , as a linear combination of logarithms of polynomials of degree  <span class="math">\\leq d</span>  where  <span class="math">d = \\lfloor D / 2 \\rfloor + 2</span> . This is the best that can be done because of condition (5).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Gröbner bases descent was used on polynomials of odd degree. For those of even degree the zigzag descent was employed (except for degree-14 polynomials, see below) because of its more aggressive descent character. Indeed, a polynomial of degree  <span class="math">2d</span> ,  <span class="math">d &amp;gt; 2</span> , is related with polynomials of degree  <span class="math">d</span>  using the zigzag descent instead of polynomials of degree  <span class="math">d + 2</span>  when using the Gröbner bases descent. The degree-4 polynomials which are not in the factor base are descended using the classical or family-based Gröbner bases descent combined with the Frobenius strategy.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As mentioned in §2.6, the zigzag descent is successful for only  <span class="math">50\\%</span>  of degree-6 polynomials. For the remainder, we used a hybrid Gröbner bases-zigzag descent. In this hybrid descent, a degree-6 polynomial is lifted to the quadratic extension of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^6}</span> , where it splits into two cubics. Over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{12}}</span> , we adapted the Gröbner bases descent in §2.5 and used it to perform a 3-to-2 descent on one of the two degree-3 polynomials. Then, using the polynomial norm as in §2.6, we obtained the logarithm of the degree-6 polynomial expressed in term of logarithms of polynomials of degree (at most) 4. This strategy allowed us to avoid the more costly 6-to-5 and then 5-to-4 Gröbner bases descent steps (recall that each of these descents has a branching factor of  <span class="math">q</span> ).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We also employed the hybrid descent on the degree-14 polynomials to perform 14-to-8 descents instead of zigzag 14-to-7 descents. In fact, a complete descent is more costly on a degree-7 polynomial than on a degree-8 polynomial since in the former two Gröbner bases descent stages, 7-to-5 then 5-to-4, are needed whereas only one zigzag 8-to-4 descent stage is needed in the latter.</p>

Total and average CPU times in seconds to obtain the logarithms of all the polynomials of degrees in [5, 15] that resulted from the continued-fractions and classical descents. The times assume that an Intel Xeon E5-2658 v2 2.40 GHz machine with 256 gigabytes of RAM is used.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 1. In hindsight, the total running time for computing logarithms in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6.509}}</span>  can be reduced substantially with two modifications to the algorithm. First, as mentioned at the end of §2.2.3, the linear systems associated with families of quartics can be reduced after discrete logarithms of a few families have been computed. Second, a 508-to-32 Guillevic descent (see §4.1) could be used instead of the 508-to-40 continued-fractions descent. The estimated cost of the 508-to-32 Guillevic descent is only 0.05 CPU years as compared to the estimated cost of 31.8 CPU years for the 508-to-40 continued-fractions descent. Moreover, the estimated costs of the subsequent 32-to-19 and 19-to-15 classical descents</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and the 15-to-4 small-degree descents are also substantially lower — 0.93, 0.99 and 2.13 CPU years, respectively (cf. Table 1).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Recall that the Frobenius representation of <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6n}}</span> requires a degree-<span class="math">n</span> irreducible factor of <span class="math">h_{1}(X)\\cdot X^{q}-h_{0}(X)</span> over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span> where <span class="math">\\max(\\deg h_{0},\\deg h_{1})=2</span>. Now, <span class="math">n=709</span> is the largest prime <span class="math">\\leq 731</span> for which there is a supersingular elliptic curve <span class="math">E</span> over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{n}}</span> with <span class="math">r=\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{3^{n}})</span> a prime. More precisely, we have <span class="math">r=3^{709}-3^{355}+1=\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{3^{709}})</span> where <span class="math">E</span> is the supersingular elliptic curve <span class="math">Y^{2}=X^{3}-X-1</span> defined over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3}</span>. The Weil and Tate pairings can be used to embed <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_{3^{709}})</span> in the multiplicative group of the 6743-bit field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 709}}</span>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">In §4.1 we describe a slight modification of a descent method proposed by Guillevic <em>[25]</em> that is considerably more effective than the continued-fractions descent. Then, in §4.2, we demonstrate that Guillevic’s descent method can be utilized to compute discrete logarithms in the cryptographically-interesting field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 709}}</span> with essentially the same resources as we expended on the <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 509}}</span> discrete logarithm computation. Thus, we conclude that discrete logarithms in the cryptographically-interesting field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 709}}</span> can be feasibly computed today.</p>

Suppose that elements of the finite field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}</span> are represented as polynomials of degree at most <span class="math">n-1</span> over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span>, with multiplication performed modulo a degree-<span class="math">n</span> irreducible polynomial. Let <span class="math">g</span> be a generator of <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}^{<em>}</span>, and let <span class="math">h\\in\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}^{</em>}</span>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since <span class="math">h</span> is an arbitrary element of <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}^{*}</span>, its degree can be as high as <span class="math">n-1</span>. Without loss of generality, we can suppose that <span class="math">h</span> has degree exactly <span class="math">n-1</span>. Guillevic observed that if <span class="math">h^{\\prime}=hv</span>, where <span class="math">v</span> is an element of the proper subfield <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{3n}}</span> of <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}</span>, then</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Now, let <span class="math">H^{\\prime}</span> be the <span class="math">6(n-n^{\\prime})\\times 3n</span> matrix consisting of the last <span class="math">6(n-n^{\\prime})</span> rows of <span class="math">H</span>. We expect that <span class="math">H^{\\prime}</span> has full row rank (otherwise we can randomize <span class="math">h</span> and repeat). Thus, each of the <span class="math">3^{6n^{\\prime}-3n}</span> solutions <span class="math">v</span> to the matrix equation <span class="math">H^{\\prime}v=e</span>, with <span class="math">e</span> being the unit vector having a 1 in it first position, yields a monic polynomial <span class="math">h^{\\prime}=Hv</span> of degree <span class="math">n^{\\prime}</span> over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">As proof-of-concept, we used the new descent method to write a degree-708 polynomial <span class="math">h\\in\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 709}}</span> in terms of a 52-smooth degree-358 monic polynomial <span class="math">h^{\\prime}</span> (so <span class="math">n=709</span>, <span class="math">c=4</span>, <span class="math">n^{\\prime}=358</span>, and <span class="math">m=52</span>). The estimated cost of finding such an <span class="math">h^{\\prime}</span> is only <span class="math">2^{43.8}M_{q}</span>. We found a 52-smooth <span class="math">h^{\\prime}</span> in about 245 CPU hours, after testing about <span class="math">2^{19.6}</span> candidates <span class="math">h^{\\prime}</span> (the search was implemented in Magma using a sub-optimal procedure for smoothness testing). In contrast, the expected cost of continued-fractions descent to write <span class="math">h</span> as <span class="math">w_{1}/w_{2}</span> where each <span class="math">w_{i}</span> is 52-smooth and has degree approximately 354 is <span class="math">2^{62.5}M_{q}</span>; this computation is feasible but only with a considerable effort.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6}}=\\mathbb{F}_{3}[u]/(u^{6}+2u^{4}+u^{2}+2u+2)</span>, <span class="math">h_{0}(X)=u^{10}X+1</span>, and <span class="math">h_{1}(X)=X^{2}+u^{110}X</span>. Then <span class="math">h_{1}(X)\\cdot X^{q}-h_{0}(X)</span> has a degree-709 irreducible factor <span class="math">I_{X}</span>, and the cofactor is an irreducible polynomial of degree 22. The field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 709}}</span> can be represented as <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6}}[X]/(I_{X})</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To find <span class="math">x=\\log_{g}h\\bmod r</span>, we first use Guillevic’s descent to find a degree-358 monic polynomial <span class="math">h^{\\prime}</span> that is 40-smooth. The expected cost of this step is <span class="math">2^{53.3}M_{q}</span>. (In contrast, the expected cost of continued-fractions descent to express <span class="math">h</span> as the ratio of two 40-smooth degree-354 polynomials is <span class="math">2^{81.3}M_{q}</span>.) Thus, the expected cost of the 708-to-40 Guillevic descent is less than the expected cost of the 508-to-40 continued-fractions descent. Furthermore, the 709-to-40 Guillevic descent will yield fewer polynomials of degree <span class="math">\\leq 40</span> than the 508-to-40 continued-fractions descent.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The remainder of the discrete logarithm computation in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 709}}</span> proceeds in the same way as the <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 509}}</span> discrete logarithm computation, except that we have to work modulo the 1124-bit prime <span class="math">r</span> instead of an 804-bit prime. The larger <span class="math">r</span> will only have a slight impact on the cost of the linear algebra. Hence, we can conclude that discrete logarithms in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 709}}</span> can be computed using essentially the same resources as we expended in the <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 509}}</span> computation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">TABLE 8. Estimated calendar time for computing a discrete logarithm in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 1429}}</span>  using machines  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">are performed on machine  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}</span> . The 728 matrices for degree-3 logarithms are solved simultaneously, with each linear system assigned to 8 cores. Then, 4,500 of the 13,122 matrices for degree-4 logarithms are solved simultaneously using 2 cores per matrix. The next 4,500 matrices are solved after that, and finally the remaining 4,122 matrices. The estimated size of the files containing logarithms of cubics is 38.3 gigabytes (only half the logarithms have to be stored thanks to the automorphism  <span class="math">\\sigma</span> ). The estimated size of the files containing logarithms of one family of quartics is 59.2 gigabytes. Thus, the logarithms of cubics and 15 quartic families, whose total size is 926.3 gigabytes, can be stored in shared RAM. Since the family-based Gröbner bases descent can be performed with respect to 30 quartic families without resorting to the quartic families stored in hard disk, we can reasonably expect that the time to compute the logarithm of a randomly-selected irreducible quartic to be no more than the time for this operation in the  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 509}}</span>  computation (where only 10 quartic families were stored in RAM), namely 0.064 seconds. Since we expect to perform  <span class="math">2^{36.94}</span>  such descents in total, we obtain an upper bound of 65 days on the time for all the small-degree descents.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The total estimated calendar time for computing a logarithm in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{3^{6\\cdot 1429}}</span>  is 173 days. It would be worthwhile to consider alternate descent strategies to reduce the expected time to the extent that the computation could be performed with relatively modest computational resources.</p>

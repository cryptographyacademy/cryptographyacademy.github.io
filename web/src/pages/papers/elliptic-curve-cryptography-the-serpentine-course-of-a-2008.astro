      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Abstract</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Over a period of sixteen years elliptic curve cryptography went from being an approach that many people mistrusted or misunderstood to being a public key technology that enjoys almost unquestioned acceptance. We describe the sometimes surprising twists and turns in this paradigm shift, and compare this story with the commonly accepted Ideal Model
of how research and development function in cryptography.  We also
discuss to what extent the ideas in the literature on &quot;social
construction of technology&quot; can contribute to a better understanding
of this history.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-misc-1" class="text-2xl font-bold">5. Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Just as the group of points on an elliptic curve can be used to construct cryptographic protocols, so can the jacobian group of a genus-g hyperelliptic curve</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$y^{2} + h(x)y = x^{2g+1} + a_{1}x^{2g} + \\dots + a_{2g+1}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(with  <span class="math">\\deg h \\leq g</span> ) defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> . This is a natural generalization of the elliptic curve group, which is the case g=1, and it was first proposed for use in cryptography in 1989 [53]. The group order for a hyperelliptic jacobian is approximately  <span class="math">q^g</span> , that is, the same size as one gets in elliptic curve cryptography working over the extension field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^g}</span> . In other words, if g is large, one can work over a small field. On the other hand, the group operation is much more cumbersome than in the elliptic curve case: it uses a process of reduction of divisors that is closely analogous to Gauss' method for composition of binary quadratic forms. But in any case it turns out that the discrete log problem is actually much easier on the jacobian of a high-genus curve than on a comparably sized group of points of an elliptic curve, as shown by Adleman, DeMarrais, and Huang [1] in 1994.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">5.1. Two meanings of &quot;complexity&quot;. The subexponential-time algorithm in [1] for the discrete log problem on the jacobian of a high-genus curve came as a big surprise to people who were starting to think about implementing hyperelliptic curve cryptography. When N. Koblitz proposed such systems in [53], he thought that the difficulty of the discrete log problem for a genus g curve would probably be at least as great as that of the corresponding problem on an elliptic curve. Isn't it reasonable to assume that a problem would be at least as hard to solve on a more complicated object (a g-dimensional jacobian) as on a relatively simple object?</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">That way of thinking was a &quot;rookie mistake&quot; for a cryptographer to make, because he was confusing two meanings of &quot;complexity&quot;: conceptual complexity and computational complexity. True, standard treatments of algebraic curves often describe the genus g as a measure of the complexity of the curve. And over a fixed field it's reasonable to regard high-genus curves as more complicated to compute with than elliptic curves.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, in practical applications what's fixed is not the field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> , but rather the bitlength of the group size  <span class="math">q^g</span> . And the algorithm in [1], while not subexponential in  <span class="math">\\log q</span> , is subexponential in  <span class="math">g \\log q</span>  as g grows. Thus, from a computational standpoint the discrete log problem on a suitably chosen elliptic curve over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{163}}</span>  has much higher complexity than the discrete log problem on the jacobian of a genus-163 hyperelliptic curve over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2</span> . Such an elliptic curve at present would provide adequate security for cryptographic applications, whereas the genus-163 curve definitely would not.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">What made high-genus hyperelliptic curves computationally simpler than low-genus curves was that there was a natural choice of &quot;small&quot; divisors that could be used in index calculus. Namely, elements of the jacobian can be uniquely represented by certain pairs of polynomials of the form (a(x),b(x)), where  <span class="math">\\deg a \\leq g</span>  and  <span class="math">\\deg b &lt; \\deg a</span> . The elements represented by (a(x),b(x)) with a(x) of small degree can be used as the &quot;factor base&quot; (see &sect;3.1) for index calculus, and this was what Adleman, DeMarrais, and Huang did.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">5.2. Further developments in genus  <span class="math">\\geq 3</span> . A few years after the subexponential index calculus algorithm was found for high-genus jacobians, Gaudry and others saw that for much smaller genus one could get similar algorithms that, while not subexponential, were significantly faster than Pollard-rho. The best and most recent of them [21] can find discrete logs in the jacobian group of a hyperelliptic curve over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  of fixed genus g in  <span class="math">O(q^{2-2/g})</span>  operations. Since a squareroot attack takes  <span class="math">O(q^{g/2})</span>  operations, this is a big improvement for  <span class="math">g \\geq 3</span> ; for example, we get  <span class="math">O(q^{4/3})</span>  rather than  <span class="math">O(q^{3/2})</span>  for genus 3. Somewhat surprisingly, for non-hyperelliptic curves of fixed genus g, Diem [20] found an algorithm with significantly faster running time than in the hyperelliptic case, namely  <span class="math">O(q^{2-2/(g-1)})</span> . However, for genus 2 thus far we have nothing faster than Pollard-rho in the general case.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-misc-2" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">6. RSA vs. ECC</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">6.1. Early attitudes toward ECC. For several years after elliptic curve cryptography was proposed, the most common response from cryptographers was curiosity and approval. Although most researchers had never studied elliptic curves and at first had little understanding of the technical issues in ECC, they tended to react positively to the general idea of a type of cryptography based on algebraic curves. In the late 1980s a broad range of mathematicians were starting to work in the field, and the growing interest in cryptography by mathematicians and the increasing sophistication of the mathematics that was being introduced perhaps were taken as an indication that public key cryptography was coming into its own and would soon be &quot;ready for prime time.&quot;</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Moreover, ECC was not perceived as a commercial threat to anyone. Commercial rivalries were still in the future, and even RSA had not yet become a major force in commerce. In fact, to most people in the 1980s the term &quot;information security&quot; meant that you bought a lock for your file cabinet. In many ways the atmosphere during the first decade of academic work on cryptography was relaxed, open-minded and curious &mdash; a contrast with what came later.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">6.2. ECC becomes a commercial threat. In the late 1980s three professors at the University of Waterloo formed a company, now called Certicom, that developed and promoted ECC. Researchers affiliated with Certicom started attending meetings of industrial standards bodies, where they lobbied for the inclusion of ECC protocols in the recommendations. For example, the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (see &sect;3.3) was making headway as an efficient alternative both to RSA signatures and to NSA's original finite field Digital Signature Algorithm (see &sect;7), although its final approval and inclusion in the standards didn't occur until 1999 and 2000 [3, 85].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Meanwhile, RSA Data Security was finally enjoying commercial success. RSA cryptography was becoming well known among the general public, and it had a virtual monopoly on the market for public key cryptography. On the other hand, there were clouds on the horizon. The recently developed number field sieve factoring method had lowered the running time for factoring a k-bit RSA modulus from  <span class="math">\\exp(k^{1/2+\\epsilon})</span>  to  <span class="math">\\exp(k^{1/3+\\epsilon})</span> . This was a dramatic improvement, and it meant that the size of the numbers recommended for safe use of RSA would soon grow to over a thousand bits. As small devices such as cell phones, pagers, and smart cards entered the mass market, promoters of ECC were cautioning that RSA would</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">have significant disadvantages in &quot;constrained environments&quot; that had low storage capacity and bandwidth.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">6.3. &quot;ECC Central&quot;: RSA strikes back. In 1997 RSA Data Security put on its website a section called &quot;ECC Central,&quot; running to nine printed pages, in order to respond to what they termed &quot;significant coverage in the media&quot; and &quot;the current excitement around elliptic curve cryptosystems.&quot; The website announced that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The recommendation of RSA, supported by the world's top cryptographers and cryptanalysts, is that the use of ECC puts customer data at far too great a risk and that further study and testing is required.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The company's main argument to justify its recommendation was that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">...the integer factorization problem (on which the security of RSA depends) has been studied intensively by number theorists and mathematicians around the world for literally hundreds of years and there is no doubt that the RSA cryptosystem has stood the test of time very well. By contrast, research into the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (on which the security of elliptic curve cryptosystems depends) and on elliptic curve cryptosystems in general represents a fraction of that spent on both RSA and the integer factorization.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The last section of the RSA policy statement rhetorically asked &quot;Elliptic curve cryptosystems ready for prime time?&quot; and answered the question in the negative.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">RSA buttressed its position by appending a section called &quot;The Experts Comment on ECC&quot; in which eight cryptographers offered their skeptical commentary. Most interesting were the statements by two of the three founders of RSA, Leonard Adleman and Ron Rivest. Adleman started by saying, &quot;I am suspicious of elliptic curve cryptosystems,&quot; and then explained his suspicion by citing his work [1] with DeMarrais and Huang giving a subexponential algorithm for the analogous problem for high-genus hyperelliptic curves. He correctly pointed out that those curves had been thought to be at least as secure as elliptic curves (see &sect;5.1).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Rivest's comments were the most erudite:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">But the security of cryptosystems based on elliptic curves is not well understood, due in large part to the abstruse nature of elliptic curves. Few cryptographers understand elliptic curves, so there is not the same widespread understanding and consensus concerning the security of elliptic curves that RSA enjoys. Over time, this may change, but for now trying to get an evaluation of the security of an elliptic-curve cryptosystem is a bit like trying to get an evaluation of some recently discovered Chaldean poetry.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Supporters of ECC countered these statements by pointing out that the claim that the security of RSA rested on sturdier ground was a little misleading. Although Gauss himself spoke of his interest in the integer factorization problem almost two hundred years ago, it is a gross exaggeration to say that mathematicians have been studying the problem intensively since that time. In fact, it was the invention of RSA cryptography in 1977 that stimulated stepped-up efforts to improve algorithms, and most of the research on integer factorization is relatively recent.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In addition, the elliptic curve discrete log problem is analogous to the corresponding problem in a finite field, and most of the approaches to the elliptic curve problem are closely related to approaches that were studied earlier in the finite field context. The discrete log problem in a finite field played an important role in cryptography long before the invention of RSA and public key: in the 1950s it arose in work on shift-register sequences. Index calculus was actually first developed in the 1920s by Kraitchik [64, 65] for the discrete log problem in a prime field, and it was not applied to integer factorization until many years later.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Moreover, it is not quite right that more sophisticated mathematical knowledge is needed to study possible attacks on elliptic curves than to study approaches to the integer factorization problem. Although it takes a little more mathematical background to understand the group law on an elliptic curve than to understand the modular exponentiation in RSA, it is illogical to conclude from this that research on breaking RSA through factoring is easier to understand than research on finding discrete logs on elliptic curves. At the time that &quot;ECC Central&quot; appeared, by far the most complicated mathematics that had ever been applied to solve either problem was the number field sieve, which had had such a dramatic impact on factoring. Contrary to what Rivest implied in the remark quoted above, in 1997 the number of cryptographers with sufficient mathematical background to analyze and improve upon the best attacks on integer factorization was less than the number who were capable of evaluating the best attacks on the elliptic curve discrete log problem. As number theorists know well, there is no correlation between ease of understanding the statement of a problem and the level of difficulty involved in making progress in solving it.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">6.4. Xedni calculus and liftings. In September 1998 J. Silverman circulated an outline of an attack [96] on the elliptic curve discrete log problem. He called it &quot;xedni&quot; calculus (xedni = index spelled backwards) because in some sense it reversed the steps in index calculus. Suppose we have two points P, Q in a prime order subgroup G &sub; E(Fp), and we want to find x such that Q = xP. Silverman's general idea was to start by randomly generating a few (no more than 9) integer linear combinations P<sup>i</sup> = aiP + biQ and then lifting them to points Pe<sup>i</sup> with Z-coordinates. He then finds a lifting Ee over Q that reduces to E mod p, passes through the Pe<sup>i</sup> , and satisfies some other conditions that, if one believes the heuristics of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture (and uses an analytic formula of J. F. Mestre for the Mordell rank of Ee), increase the likelihood that the points Pe<sup>i</sup> &isin; Ee will be dependent over Z. If they are dependent, then it's easy to find x.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Although the outline of xedni calculus was fairly simple, its running time would depend on some subtle considerations that were hard to pin down in computational terms. At first it was completely unclear whether or not xedni calculus would be more efficient than other algorithms for finding elliptic curve discrete logs. This was still a time when RSA and ECC were in fierce competition, and the promoters of ECC feared that RSA people would seize upon the opportunity provided by xedni calculus and proclaim to the world that ECC had been broken.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Fortunately, however, it turned out that slight modifications of Silverman's algorithm could be used to solve not only the discrete log problem in the multiplicative group of F<sup>p</sup> (by applying it to a degenerate elliptic curve, i.e., a rational curve over Fp), but also the problem of factoring an RSA modulus N (by applying it to a degenerate elliptic curve over Z/NZ). In other words, if Silverman's algorithm destroyed ECC, then it would destroy RSA as well. This feature of the algorithm was very opportune, because it gave us time to analyze it without having to worry about RSA people making premature announcements about the threat from xedni calculus.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The xedni algorithm was found to be extremely inefficient; in fact, it seemed to take super-exponential time to find discrete logs [43]. The reason was basically the same one that Miller [80] had used back in 1985 to argue that index calculus wouldn't work on elliptic curves. Namely, the N&acute;eron-Tate height function guaranteed that Ee(Q) couldn't have a large number of &quot;small&quot; points.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Once again the height function played a crucial role in explaining why lifting techniques couldn't be efficiently used to find discrete logs. In 2000 N. Koblitz gave a talk on this at the ECC conference in Essen titled &quot;Miracles of the Height Function &mdash; A Golden Shield Protecting ECC.&quot; Subsequent developments would show that Koblitz's celebration of the &quot;golden shield&quot; was premature, as researchers found faster-than-squareroot and even subexponential index calculus attacks on some elliptic curves defined over certain classes of finite fields (see &sect;10). However, in none of these partial successes of index calculus have liftings to global fields played any role.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">At the ECC conference in 2007 Silverman [97] gave a much more systematic analysis of the failure of four possible plans of attack on the discrete log problem based on lifting to a global field. But despite the repeated failure of lifting-based approaches, one cannot be absolutely certain that no lifting will ever work. For this reason some people recommend staying away from elliptic curves over F<sup>q</sup> for which it is easy to construct a lifting to a number field that has special properties that might some day prove useful to an attacker. In particular, in &sect;11 we'll discuss the recommendation of the Brainpool consortium that all curves used in ECC have complex multiplication by quadratic imaginary fields of very high class number so that they cannot efficiently be lifted to a CM-curve over a number field.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the 1970s and early 1980s the U.S. National Security Agency was an extremely secretive organization. The standing joke at the time was that NSA stood for &quot;No Such Agency.&quot; People from NSA would attend the crypto conferences that were starting to be held, but they would never identify where they worked.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">NSA was unhappy with the sudden growth of open research on cryptography that had been stimulated by the invention of public key systems and especially RSA. In 1980 they made a heavy-handed and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to impose a system of prior restraint on publication of mathematical articles that they judged to have cryptographic relevance (see [67]).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">But by the time the debates between RSA and ECC heated up in the 1990s, NSA had changed in a fundamental way &mdash; it had &quot;come in from the cold.&quot; There were two main reasons for the transformation of NSA into an organization that started to participate openly in the cryptographic research community.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The first reason was a broadening of NSA's mandate after the passage of the Computer Security Act of 1987. Originally NSA had been given responsibility only for communication security for the U.S. military and government agencies. But with the emergence of the Internet and other technologies, communications were increasingly mixed up with computers, and it was becoming clear that issues of computer security and communication security could not be separated. In addition, most government communications were integrated with the public network and faced the same threats as everyone else. So government security could not be kept separate from similar issues in the private sector. Thus, in 1987 the U.S. government agency NIST (National Institute for Standards and Technology, the new name of the National Bureau of Standards) was given a mandate to investigate and help establish standards for security of all sorts of computer and communication networks. According to some accounts [24, 70] the intent of the Computer Security Act of 1987 in explicitly assigning this task to NIST was to have non-military cryptography under civilian control and prevent NSA from venturing into the private sector. However, in practice NSA has had the resources and expertise to dominate NIST, and NIST has rarely played a significant independent role. In any case, whatever the intent of the Act was, in the aftermath NSA took on an increasing role in the civilian world.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The second basic reason for the emergence of a &quot;kinder, friendlier NSA&quot; (in the words of a top NSA official [108]) was the end of the Cold War. During the decade between the collapse of the Soviet Union and the 9/11/2001 attacks, the U.S. did not have any obvious external enemy. As a result the companies, government agencies, and even academic disciplines (such as Russian area studies) that had come to prominence during the Cold War had to re-tool or else risk losing their relevance and their funding. Thus, it was strongly in NSA's interest to show that it had a role to play in developing technology that could protect the commercial world and the public at large from all sorts of threats to their communications.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Whatever the reasons for NSA's new focus, the timing could not have been better for elliptic curve cryptography, which by the mid-1990s was locked in an increasingly nasty competition with RSA. From a commercial standpoint RSA had a tremendous advantage over the Canadian company Certicom, which was the main promoter of ECC. RSA was well established, had name recognition and had the lion's share of the public key cryptography market. On the other hand, the advent of the number field sieve forced RSA to use longer and longer keys. People who understood the math behind the two systems could see that over time RSA would be inferior to ECC in constrained environments where memory and bandwidth are very limited.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the early 1990s there was a controversy over a proposed Digital Signature Standard that to some extent presaged the role that NSA would later play in the debate over ECC. NIST proposed a protocol for digital signatures that had been developed by NSA and closely resembled an earlier method invented by C. Schnorr. In these systems the security of signatures was based on the discrete log problem in a finite field. This choice was a direct challenge to the predominance of factorizationbased cryptography, and it was bitterly opposed by RSA. Although the Digital Signature Standard &mdash; which was approved for commercial use in 1994 &mdash; was not based on elliptic curves, it signaled a dissatisfaction with RSA technology within NSA.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The technical people in NSA had been attracted to elliptic curve cryptography since the 1980s. But the first time these views became known to the outside world occurred at a meeting of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in December 1995. Meetings of standards bodies typically include industry representatives who have little mathematical background and so are easily manipulated by scare tactics. At the meeting in question, the RSA people were casting doubt on the safety of ECC-based protocols. As the heated debate continued, one of the NSA representatives left to make a phone call. He then returned to the meeting and announced that NSA believed that ECC had sufficient security to be used for communications among all U.S. government agencies, including the Federal Reserve. People were stunned. Normally the NSA representatives at standards meetings would sit quietly and hardly say a word. No one had expected such a direct and unambiguous statement from NSA &mdash; a statement that tipped the scales at ANSI in favor of ECC.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">At Crypto '97 J. Solinas gave the first paper ever presented publicly at a cryptography meeting by an NSA member. It contained a procedure he had developed (see [102]) for greatly improved efficiency of ECC using anomalous binary curves (see &sect;11.1). NSA's support for ECC became more and more obvious over the years. In 2003 it licensed 26 ECC-related patents from Certicom for US$25 million, and in 2005 it posted the paper &quot;The Case for Elliptic Curve Cryptography&quot; on its website (see &sect;1).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The influence of NSA, which is part of the U.S. Department of Defense, on the RSA versus ECC debate is an example of a general phenomenon that has been documented by sociologists and historians of technology. For example, Braun and MacDonald (see [13] and [72], p. 16) have shown that military support played an essential role in the history of the microchip, especially in the early years of semiconductor electronics when the commercial world viewed solid-state devices as inferior to the earlier valve technology. According to MacKenzie and Wajcman ([72], p. 15), &quot;Military interest in new technology has often been crucial in overcoming what might otherwise have been insuperable economic barriers to its development and adoption.&quot; In a sense, NSA served as a counterweight to RSA's market advantage, and in this way helped level the playing field between RSA and ECC.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-misc-3" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">8. XTR vs. ECC</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">At Crypto 2000 A. Lenstra and Verheul [68] proposed a new type of cryptosystem called XTR. They choose a prime p such that  <span class="math">p^2 - p + 1</span>  has a large prime factor n, and they let G be the subgroup  <span class="math">\\mu_n \\subset \\mathbb{F}_{p^6}^*</span>  of order n in the multiplicative group of the degree-6 extension of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> . They have a way (which they call the &quot;trace representation&quot;) of writing elements of G as efficiently as if they lived in the subfield  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}</span>  (which, of course, they don't). But to find discrete logs in G by index calculus methods one would have to work in the field of  <span class="math">p^6</span>  elements, not  <span class="math">p^2</span>  elements. Lenstra and Verheul explained the advantages of their system:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">XTR achieves security similar to RSA for much smaller key sizes than RSA. Although ECC key sizes can be somewhat further reduced than XTR key sizes, in many circumstances... key sizes of ECC and XTR will be comparable... XTR may be regarded as the best of two worlds, RSA and ECC.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">They also claimed a security advantage over ECC:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, XTR is not affected by the uncertainty still marring ECC security.... Also, compared to ECC, the mathematics underlying</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">XTR is straightforward, thus avoiding two common ECC-pitfalls: ascertaining that unfortunate parameter choices are avoided that happen to render the system less secure, and keeping abreast of... newly obtained results.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">At the Crypto 2000 Rump Session, Menezes and Vanstone responded to the claims for XTR by pointing out that the XTR group is precisely the group to which a certain supersingular curve E defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}</span>  is isomorphic using the Weil pairing. Since the appearance of the Weil pairing attack [75], such curves were generally avoided in ECC. Isn't it risky to start using a group that is so intimately related to a weak case of ECC? Of course, the Weil embedding transports the discrete log problem on E to the XTR group, not vice-versa. This means that the problem on E reduces to the problem on the XTR group, not that the two problems are equivalent. However, Menezes and Vanstone asked whether there might be an efficiently computable map in the other direction that inverted the map coming from the Weil pairing. If so, then that would show that the discrete log problems on the two groups are exactly equivalent.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">8.1. Verheul's theorem. Lenstra and Verheul were bothered by the suggestion that their system was equivalent in security to that of supersingular ECC. In 2000 supersingular elliptic curves were still viewed as too weak for cryptography. Verheul took up the challenge of Menezes-Vanstone, and was able to prove a striking theorem [104, 105]: If an efficiently computable isomorphism existed from the XTR group to the curve, then the Diffie-Hellman problem would be easy in both groups. Since that was unlikely, he concluded that the map goes only one way.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Verheul's own interpretation of his theorem &mdash; stated boldly in the title to [104, 105] &mdash; was that it provided evidence that XTR has strictly greater security (in the sense of hardness of the discrete log problem) than the corresponding supersingular ECC. However, in the first place, that conclusion does not follow logically from the theorem. There is in fact no evidence that there's any method of solving the discrete log problem on the supersingular curve that's faster than embedding it in the XTR group and then solving the discrete log problem in that group. Just because a possible avenue to proving equivalence of two problems &mdash; namely, constructing an efficient isomorphism in both directions &mdash; has been shown to be unlikely, that doesn't mean that in practice the problems are not equivalent. For example, on curves of high embedding degree the so-called decision Diffie-Hellman problem (the problem, given  <span class="math">g, g^x, g^y</span> , of determining whether or not a fourth group element is equal to  <span class="math">g^{xy}</span> ) is believed to be solvable only if one can find the discrete log of  <span class="math">g^x</span>  or  <span class="math">g^{y}</span> . However, it is highly unlikely that anyone will be able to prove by a reduction that the decision Diffie-Hellman problem is equivalent to the discrete log problem in such a group.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If someone really believes, along with Verheul, that the supersingular curve E over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}</span>  might be even less secure than the subgroup of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^6}^*</span>  into which it embeds, then presumably the same would apply to all supersingular curves. That would have dire implications for much of pairing-based cryptography. However, Verheul's theorem was presented just a few months before the first major pairing-based protocols were announced. So at the time no one was worried about this implication of Verheul's claim in the title of his papers [104, 105].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">And what if a map in the reverse direction <em>could</em> be constructed? It turns out that Verheul's theorem can be generalized (see [28, 83]) to all supersingular curves</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and all finite fields. Thus, the construction of such a map would imply that the Diffie-Hellman problem is easy in all finite fields and all supersingular elliptic curves. We do not mean to suggest that this is likely &mdash; we only want to illustrate the point that Verheul's theorem lends itself to multiple interpretations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">8.2. Skepticism's last gasp. Despite the disparaging comments about ECC by the promoters of XTR, skepticism about elliptic curves was very much on the decline by the start of the new millenium. Industrial standards bodies had endorsed certain forms of ECC (see, e.g., [3, 85]), and &quot;ECC Central&quot; had been removed from the RSA website.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This is not to say that no one in recent years has expressed doubts about ECC. Occasionally a writer on cryptography might object to the increasing acceptance of elliptic curve technology. For example, Bruce Schneier, the author of a best-selling guide to cryptography, has a popular blog that in 2005 took comments on the NSA paper &quot;The Case for Elliptic Curve Cryptography&quot; (see &sect;1). In response to a blogger who wrote, &quot;But ECC was less researched than the others [sic] algorithms!&quot; Schneier posted the comment: &quot;I agree with you, not the NSA.&quot;</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Starting in 2001, pairing-based cryptosystems were proposed by Dan Boneh, Matt Franklin, and others. Although some of the ideas had been around for a couple of years (see, for example, [45, 89]), their tremendous potential had not been realized before.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The basic idea is that the Weil or Tate pairing on elliptic curves allows certain cryptographic functions to be performed more efficiently than ever before, provided that one works with elliptic curves where the pairing can be efficiently computed, i.e., curves of low embedding degree. Such curves have the &quot;Diffie-Hellman gap&quot; property, which means that the Diffie-Hellman problem is thought to be difficult, whereas the decision Diffie-Hellman problem (see &sect;8.1) can be easily solved using the pairing.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One of the first uses of pairing-based cryptography was the elegant solution by Boneh and Franklin [10] to an old question of Shamir [93], who had asked whether an efficient encryption scheme could be devised in which a user's public key would be just her identity (e.g., e-mail address). Such a system is called identity-based encryption. Another early application (see below) was to obtain short signatures.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">9.1. Boneh-Lynn-Shacham signatures. We shall describe the pairing-based signature scheme of Boneh-Lynn-Shacham [11] in the setting of the supersingular elliptic curve</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(1) y^2 = x^3 - x</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">defined over Fp, p &equiv; 3 (mod 4). This curve E has group order p+ 1 and embedding degree 2; suppose that p is chosen so that n = (p + 1)/4 is prime. Let P be a fixed and publicly known generator of the subgroup G &sub; E(Fp) of prime order n. We define what's called a distortion map on the Fp<sup>2</sup> -points of E as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$Q=(u,v)\\mapsto \\widetilde{Q}=(-u,iv), \\text{ where } i^2=-1,\\ i\\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^2}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This is the reduction mod p of the usual complex multiplication on the Q-curve with equation (1). It gives an isomorphism from G &sub; E(Fp) to a &quot;distorted group&quot;  <span class="math">\\widetilde{G} \\subset E(\\mathbb{F}_{p^2})</span>  that, together with G, generates all of E[n]. Note that non-degeneracy of the Weil pairing implies that the pairing of a nontrivial element of G with a nontrivial element of  <span class="math">\\widetilde{G}</span>  gives a nontrivial n-th root of unity.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Each user Alice chooses a random integer  <span class="math">x \\mod n</span> , which is her secret key, and computes the point Q = xP, which is her public key. Suppose that Alice wants to sign a message to Bob that has hash value H, which we suppose is an  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> -point of E. All she does is compute S = xH, which is her signature for the message. When Bob receives the message and the signature he computes the hash value H and then the two pairing values</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(H, \\widetilde{Q})</span>$
and  <span class="math">(S, \\widetilde{P})</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If Alice created the signature correctly, then the two values must be equal, because they are both equal to</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(H,\\widetilde{P})^x</span>$
.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Bob has confidence that only Alice could have signed the message, because only she would have been able to generate the point S whose discrete log to the base H is the same as the discrete log of Q to the base P.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Not only is the Boneh-Lynn-Shacham signature shorter in bitlength and easier to describe than the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (see &sect;3.3), but, unlike ECDSA, it uses properties of elliptic curves in an essential way and does not have any analogue in the simpler group  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q^*</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">9.2. Selection of curves. There are two ways to select a curve of low embedding degree k. One can choose a supersingular curve, for which  <span class="math">k \\leq 6</span> . Supersingular curves have the advantage that there is a computable distortion map that can be used to construct protocols (see &sect;9.1).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, one often wants  <span class="math">k \\geq 6</span>  to be large enough so that the time required to find discrete logs using index calculus in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}</span>  is comparable to the time required to find discrete logs directly in the group G using a squareroot attack. At present k=6 is a reasonable choice, but with increased computing power the optimal choice of k will soon be larger. A supersingular curve with k=6 exists only in characteristic 3, and there is no supersingular curve with k&gt;6. Thus, implementers might want to use ordinary curves of low embedding degree. Such curves are rare, and the only way known to construct them is to use the so-called CM-method.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let E be an ordinary elliptic curve defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  with  <span class="math">trace\\ t</span> , which means that  <span class="math">\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_p)=p+1-t</span> . We want p+1-t to be a prime (or a prime times a very small cofactor); we want  <span class="math">p^k\\equiv 1\\pmod{p+1-t}</span>  (note that this is equivalent to  <span class="math">(t-1)^k\\equiv 1\\pmod{p+1-t}</span> ; and we want the discriminant  <span class="math">t^2-4p</span>  to have small squarefree part d, in which case a curve over a number field can be found with complex multiplication by  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})</span>  that reduces modulo a prime lying over p to a curve with the desired properties. The idea of the construction of ordinary curves with low k by the CM-method is to find a family of integers (p,t) parameterized by an integer z such that the second and third of these conditions hold (and there's a reasonable probability that p is prime and p+1-t has a large prime factor). The first results of this type were found for k=3,4,6 in [79]; in the case k=6 they set  <span class="math">p=4z^2+1</span>  and  <span class="math">t=1\\pm 2z</span> . Subsequently other authors showed how to construct ordinary curves for certain embedding degrees k&gt;6.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">9.3. Like a knife through butter. Pairing-based cryptography received near-universal acceptance and acclaim from the beginning. Unlike traditional ECC, it did not pass through a period of several years of skepticism and resistance. We find this especially striking because the curves used in this type of cryptography are precisely the ones that were shunned in ECC for many years after the discovery of the Weil pairing attack [75] and were still being disparaged as late as Eurocrypt 2001 by Verheul [104].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This paradoxical turn of events has several possible explanations. In the first place, it is hard not to be attracted by the sheer elegance of some of the constructions in pairing-based cryptography. Note, for example, how much simpler the Boneh-Lynn-Shacham signature is to describe (see &sect;9.1) than the ECDSA was (see &sect;3.3).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the second place, the timing was propitious. The first major pairing-based protocols were being promoted in the years right after traditional ECC had won acceptance and the once-bitter rivalry between RSA and ECC had subsided. Basically, most of the earlier critics of ECC had thrown in the towel &mdash; starting in the late 1990s the RSA software toolkit even included a version of ECC.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the history of technology it often happens that after a period of intense debate (what the sociologists Kline and Pinch [48] call interpretative flexibility) a consensus emerges to admit the &quot;new kid on the block&quot; into full membership in the club. At that point most people see no benefit in standing in the way of adopting the newer technology; rather, it seems to be in everyone's interest to incorporate it into their theories and products. This process is known as closure. As Kline and Pinch explain,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Interpretative flexibility, however, does not continue forever. 'Closure' and stabilization occur, such that some artifacts [i.e., inventions] appear to have fewer problems and become increasingly the dominant form of the technology. This, it should be noted, may not result in all rivals vanishing, and often two very different technologies can exist side by side (for example, jet planes and propeller planes). Also this process of closure and stabilization need not be final. New problems can emerge and interpretative flexibility may reappear. ([48], pp. 113-114)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A third explanation for the immediate acceptance of pairing-based cryptography is that by 2001 the viewpoint that papers proposing new protocols must always include a &quot;proof of security&quot; had become pervasive, especially on cryptography conference program committees. Almost all papers proposing pairing-based protocols included such &quot;proofs,&quot; and they served to reassure people about the security of the systems.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This isn't the place to repeat the critique of &quot;provable security&quot; in the series of papers [57, 58, 59]. Suffice it to say that the guarantees given by such proofs, even when the proofs are mathematically correct, are very conditional and contingent. In recent years what has often happened is that, whether or not readers fully understand the proof, they are mesmerized by it and are willing to put aside any doubts they might have had. Most likely this effect was at work in causing virtually universal and unquestioning acceptance of pairing-based cryptography in the research community.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">What a &quot;security proof&quot; &mdash; or, as we prefer to say, a reductionist security argument [57] &mdash; actually does is show that an adversary cannot succeed in mounting a certain category of attack unless a certain underlying mathematical problem is tractable. What is peculiar in the case of pairing-based cryptography is that the underlying mathematical problem is often a very contrived one, of the sort that hardly any mathematician would recognize as natural, let alone want to study. Nevertheless, it has become customary to regard a conditional result related to such a problem as a type of guarantee of security.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For example, the underlying problem in [8] is called the m-strong Diffie-Hellman problem in a group G of prime order n. Let g be a generator of G, and let x denote an unknown integer mod n. Given the m+1 group elements  <span class="math">g, g^x, g^{x^2}, \\ldots, g^{x^m}</span> , the m-strong Diffie-Hellman problem asks one to find a pair (c,h) (where c is a nonzero integer mod n and h is a group element) such that  <span class="math">h^{x+c} = g</span> . At first it seemed that in practice this problem would prove to be as hard as finding discrete logs &mdash; in other words, in a generic group G no algorithm would be faster than  <span class="math">\\sqrt{n}</span> . However, at Eurocrypt 2006 Cheon [17], using the same method that had been described earlier in a different context by Brown and Gallant [16], showed that if n-1 has a factor  <span class="math">m_0 \\leq m</span>  of size a little less than  <span class="math">n^{1/3}</span> , then the m-strong problem can be solved in roughly  <span class="math">n^{1/3}</span>  operations. So the underlying problem used in the security proof turned out to be weaker than expected.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Some of the other underlying problems that occur in reductionist security arguments for pairing-based systems are even more ornate and contrived than the m-strong Diffie-Hellman problem (see [60] for some examples). Nevertheless, few people have expressed skepticism regarding the true security of the &quot;provably secure&quot; pairing-based protocols.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We wish to stress that we have no reason to believe that any pairing-based protocol is actually insecure. Our purpose in discussing this issue is not to urge people to avoid such cryptosystems, but rather to raise the intriguing question of why there have been hardly any skeptics in the research community.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A final reason for the rapid acceptance of pairing-based cryptography is that it was not perceived as a threat either to important commercial interests or to established traditions of cryptographic research. On the contrary, the idea had an immediate appeal both for practical reasons &mdash; it provided the opportunity to improve functionality &mdash; and for intellectual reasons as well &mdash; it used some clever ideas in both mathematics and protocol design.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Moreover, the timing could not have been better for the cryptography profession, which was having some difficulty coming up with a lot of nice problems for research projects. A large number of people with math or computer science backgrounds had entered the field and were faced with the challenge &mdash; especially, but not exclusively, in academia &mdash; to &quot;publish or perish.&quot; In addition, there had been a proliferation of cryptography conferences, all of which hoped to attract cutting-edge research papers. An increasing concern of program committees was that it was unrealistic to expect the amount of high-quality research to have increased at the same rate as the number of conferences. Against this backdrop the entrance onto the stage of pairing-based cryptography was like a godsend.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As mentioned before, pairing-based cryptography started at the height of influence of the notion of &quot;provable security,&quot; and almost all papers in the area included reductionist arguments for the security of the proposed protocol. Interestingly, this</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">tradition of always including a security proof led to even more possibilities for research projects, thanks to the controversy surrounding the so-called &quot;random oracle model.&quot; (The random oracle model basically allows one to make arguments for the security of a protocol under the plausible assumption that hash function values are indistinguishable from random bitstrings.) Leading theoreticians &mdash; apparently inspired in part by the Biblical story of the Bronze Serpent (see [33], pp. 10-11) &mdash; had decided that the random oracle assumption that is used in many security proofs is suspect, and cryptographers should try to design protocols that have security proofs that avoid the use of this assumption. As a result it became common first to develop a protocol with nice properties that has a proof of security in the random oracle model, and then to publish a modified version, usually with slightly less desirable properties but with a security proof in a &quot;standard&quot; model. This was an important advance for the profession, since in one fell swoop it increased the number of papers that could be published on provably secure protocols from N to 2N.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">10.1. Weil descent. In the late 1990s Gerhard Frey had the idea of attacking the discrete log problem on an elliptic curve defined over Fq<sup>m</sup> by transporting it to the jacobian group of a curve over the smaller field Fq, where it could be solved using index calculus in a way similar to [1]. This program was first carried out in certain cases by Gaudry, Hess, and Smart [31], and their method has been generalized by Hess [37].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In some very special situations it has been possible to transport the discrete log problem on the elliptic curve defined over Fq<sup>m</sup> to the corresponding problem on the jacobian group of a genus-m curve defined over F<sup>q</sup> (in that case both groups have the same order &asymp; q <sup>m</sup>). In other special cases the genus of the curve is considerably larger than m, but the resulting algorithm is still faster-than-squareroot as a function of q m.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Weil descent doesn't apply over prime fields, and in the range of interest in cryptography it seems not to apply to curves considered over prime degree extensions of F<sup>2</sup> (see [76]). Its main successes so far have been for curves defined over the fields F2 <sup>f</sup> when f is divisible by 3, 5, 6, 7, or 8. For example, in [78] one of the classes of curves to which the Weil descent methods in [31] were shown to be applicable is the set of all elliptic curves E defined over F25<sup>&#8467;</sup> (with &#8467; prime) and not over a proper subfield. In theory it might be possible to transport the discrete log problem on E to the jacobian of a genus-5 curve over F2<sup>&#8467;</sup> , for which there would be an index calculus algorithm requiring O(2<sup>1</sup>.6<sup>&#8467;</sup> ) operations. In practice, though, the curves that came out of the Weil descent had genus 15 or 16, resulting in an algorithm with running time roughly 2<sup>2</sup><sup>&#8467;</sup> . This was still significantly better than Pollard-rho, which takes time 2<sup>2</sup>.5&#8467;+<sup>&#491;</sup> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">10.2. Other potentially weak fields for ECC. In [30] Gaudry used index calculus methods directly on elliptic curves defined over Fq<sup>m</sup> with m &gt; 1. For a factor base he used the set of points whose x-coordinate lies in Fq. He performed the crucial step of expressing a randomly generated point in terms of the factor base by means of summation polynomials, a concept introduced by Semaev [92]. For fixed m the running time of Gaudry's algorithm was O(q <sup>2</sup>&minus;2/m), so for <sup>m</sup> <sup>&ge;</sup> 3 this gave a faster-than-squareroot attack.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In addition, Diem [19] proved that Gaudry's algorithm yields a subexponential algorithm when the size of the field Fq<sup>m</sup> increases in such a way that m<sup>2</sup> is of order log q.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Fortunately for ECC, by the late 1990s implementers had largely restricted themselves to either prime fields or prime-degree extensions of F2. Prime fields and binary fields have traditionally been the easiest finite fields to use in most applications. The choice of prime degree m of F2<sup>m</sup> was partly dictated by the desire to allow the use of anomalous binary curves (see &sect;11.1), which must be taken over such an extension if one wants the group order to be divisible by a prime of roughly m bits. Thus, when NIST decided to recommend one random curve and one anomalous binary curve for each recommended binary field, it was natural to choose m to be prime values for which the order of one of the curves (2) or (3) (see below) is equal to twice a prime or four times a prime [85]. In any case, because of this preference for prime fields and prime-degree binary fields, the faster-than-squareroot attacks described in this section, none of which applied to curves over such fields, had no impact on real-world implementations.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-misc-4" class="text-2xl font-bold">11. A Tale of Two Standards: Brainpool vs. Voltage</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we compare two recent recommendations concerning which elliptic curves to use in ECC. One comes from Brainpool, a European consortium of companies and government agencies led by Bundesamt f&uml;ur Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI, the German equivalent of NSA). The other one [12] comes from an American company called Voltage, which presented it at a NIST workshop on pairing-based protocols (see [73]). What is interesting to us is the extent to which these recommendations contradict one another.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The Brainpool draft [71] explicitly excludes all elliptic curves of low embedding degree (hence all supersingular curves) and all ordinary elliptic curves whose CM-field has low class number (hence all curves constructed by the CM-method). In particular, Brainpool rules out all curves (supersingular or ordinary) used in pairing-based cryptography.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Both of these Brainpool requirements are given in a rather extreme form. The embedding degree must be greater than (q &minus; 1)/100. If, for example, q has 160 bits (the smallest size they allow), then they are saying that it's a bad idea to use an elliptic curve group that embeds in a finite field of the form F<sup>q</sup> <sup>k</sup> with k a 150-bit integer (i.e., k &asymp; (q &minus; 1)/1000). Note that in such a humongous field the fastest algorithms known for the finite field discrete log would take time greater than exp(10<sup>15</sup>) &mdash; roughly 1 followed by four hundred trillion zeros. Brainpool certainly seems to want to err on the side of caution! They also require that when the elliptic curve lifts to an elliptic curve over a number field that has complex multiplication, that number field must have degree greater than ten million.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In contrast, the Voltage recommendation [73] states under &quot;security considerations&quot; that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The conservative choice for implementing a pairing-based algorithm is to use a supersingular curve.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The elliptic curve they recommend using is the curve</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$y^2 = x^3 + b</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">over a prime field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  with  <span class="math">p \\equiv -1 \\pmod{12}</span> . This curve has p+1 points, embedding degree 2, and complex multiplication by the ring  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta]</span> ,  <span class="math">\\zeta = \\exp(2\\pi i/3)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Moreover, the Voltage curve has far more structure than most curves because it is supersingular. Namely, supersingular curves have a gigantic endomorphism ring &mdash; a quaternion algebra that includes imaginary quadratic rings as a small part. For the Voltage curve E the endomorphism ring of  <span class="math">E(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_p)</span>  is the following quaternion algebra:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathbb{Z} + \\mathbb{Z}\\zeta + \\mathbb{Z}\\phi + \\mathbb{Z}\\phi\\zeta</span>$
,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">\\phi</span>  is the Frobenius endomorphism  <span class="math">(x,y) \\mapsto (x^p,y^p)</span> , which satisfies the relation  <span class="math">\\phi^2 = -p</span> . Since  <span class="math">\\zeta^p = \\zeta^{-1}</span> , the commutation relation here is:  <span class="math">\\zeta \\phi = \\phi \\zeta^{-1} = -\\phi - \\phi \\zeta</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">No one has ever been able to use this vast stable of endomorphisms to mount an attack on the discrete log problem on a supersingular curve. So there is no real evidence that the Voltage curve is weak. But its extensive special properties would certainly give heartburn to the Brainpool cryptographers.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">What is Voltage's rationale for referring to its curve as the &quot;conservative choice&quot;? In the context of pairing-based cryptography, if you want to use an ordinary curve rather than a supersingular curve, you must use a very special version of the CM-method to construct your curve (see  <span class="math">\\S 9.2</span> ). As explained in [73], &quot;With ordinary curves, additional structure is needed to get a low embedding degree.&quot; As mentioned in [56], the type of special values of p that are used might cause the discrete log problem in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^k}</span>  (where k is the embedding degree) to be vulnerable to a version of the special number field sieve rather than the general number field sieve. Indeed, Schirokauer [90] has shown that this is true in a few cases. However, in most cases it is far from clear that the &quot;additional structure&quot; in the choice of the prime p or the group order p could ever be utilized by an attacker. So whether the &quot;conservative choice&quot; is to use supersingular curves or to generate ordinary curves of low embedding degree &mdash; or perhaps (if one is a follower of Brainpool) to avoid pairing-based cryptography altogether &mdash; is anyone's guess.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">11.1. <strong>Special or random selection of parameters?</strong> A general philosophy one often encounters in cryptography is that whenever possible parameters should be chosen by some random process. If a special choice is made to increase efficiency, there is always the risk that the same property that made the choice so attractive will also lead to vulnerability to an unanticipated attack.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the case of elliptic curve cryptography one of the arguments for its superiority over RSA was the tremendous variety of curves to choose from. This means that there are several opportunities to introduce randomness into parameter selection. One can make a random choice of prime field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> , for instance, followed by random choices of the coefficients in the Weierstrass equation of the curve. This is, in fact, essentially what Brainpool recommends.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In 1985 R. Schoof [91] devised the first polynomial-time algorithm to determine the group order for an arbitrary elliptic curve. His method was greatly improved upon by Atkin, Morain, Elkies, and others. Much of this work was based on isogenies of elliptic curves; this was the first &mdash; but not the last (see &sect;11.2) &mdash; cryptographic application of isogenies.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The availability of efficient point-counting algorithms for random elliptic curves means that there is no practical reason not to use them. On the other hand, certain special curves have significant efficiency advantages. For example, over characteristic-2 fields one can save a lot of time computing point multiples by using the so-called <em>anomalous binary curves</em> defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(2) y^2 + xy = x^3 + x^2 + 1</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(3) y^2 + xy = x^3 + 1</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(see [54, 102]). In elliptic curve cryptography one would use a prime order subgroup of the group of points defined over an extension of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The conventional wisdom is that there's a trade-off. If you want long-term security, you must be willing to sacrifice a little bit of efficiency and generate your parameters in a random way. On the other hand, if a special choice of parameters allows for greater efficiency and if there are no known attacks that utilize their special properties, and if you're willing to risk the possibility that such attacks will be found some day, then by all means use, for example, anomalous binary curves.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This point of view seems logical, and it is uncontroversial among cryptographers. However, under certain circumstances it may be wrong. In particular, it is conceivable that Brainpool's super-cautious recommendations might cause one to choose curves that are <em>less secure</em> than some CM-type curves might be. In other words, random curves might be riskier than special curves.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Before explaining how this is possible, we'd like to make a remark about the notion of special versus generic curves. As we saw in &sect;5.1, a word such as &quot;complexity&quot; might have a different meaning in cryptography than in traditional mathematics; conceptual complexity and computational complexity are two quite different things. The same goes for the term &quot;special curve.&quot;</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Example 1.</strong> In the study of algebraic curves one normally regards hyperelliptic curves as a very special subclass. For  <span class="math">g \\geq 3</span>  there are far fewer hyperelliptic than non-hyperelliptic curves in the sense that the hyperelliptic curves correspond to a submanifold of codimension g-2 in the moduli space of all genus-g curves. That is, for  <span class="math">g \\geq 3</span>  there are roughly  <span class="math">1/q^{g-2}</span>  times as many hyperelliptic curves as non-hyperelliptic curves over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Yet Diem and Thom&eacute; [22] found an index calculus attack on the discrete log problem in the jacobian group of a genus-3 non-hyperelliptic curve over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  that has running time of order only  <span class="math">q^{1+\\epsilon}</span> . In [20] Diem generalized this algorithm to all &quot;sufficiently general&quot; non-hyperelliptic curves of arbitrary genus  <span class="math">g \\geq 3</span>  with running time  <span class="math">q^{2-2/(g-1)+\\epsilon}</span> . This algorithm is substantially faster than the fastest known algorithm for discrete logs in the jacobian group of a hyperelliptic curve (see [21]), which takes time  <span class="math">q^{2-(2/g)+\\epsilon}</span> . To put it another way, over a fixed field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  the discrete log problem on the jacobian of a genus-g hyperelliptic curve has the same computational complexity (in the sense of the best available algorithms) as the discrete log problem on the (much larger) jacobian of a genus-(g+1) non-hyperelliptic curve. It turned out that a certain way in which a generic non-hyperelliptic curve can be represented as a plane curve allows for a particularly efficient generation of relations among divisor classes. Thus, to the best of our current knowledge, it</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">is the non-hyperelliptic curves and not the hyperelliptic curves whose discrete log problems have a special vulnerability to index calculus.<sup>4</sup></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">There are various scenarios in which someone (say, Alice) who chose to use ECC with a special curve might end up better off than someone else (say, Bob) who chose a random curve. Our first example is a little removed from practice because we use extension fields of composite degree, whereas real-world implementations of ECC generally are over either a prime field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  or an extension of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2</span>  of prime degree.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Example 2.</strong> Suppose that Alice wants to use an anomalous  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2</span> -curve (2) or (3) over a field extension of degree  <span class="math">5\\ell</span>  with  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  prime. She knows, of course, that, because of the large subgroup of order  <span class="math">\\approx 2^{\\ell}</span>  consisting of the  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{\\ell}}</span> -points of the curve, the largest prime order subgroup she can hope to get has order roughly  <span class="math">2^{4\\ell}</span> . (It'll actually be a little smaller because there's also a subgroup of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^5}</span> -points.) This means that the Pollard-rho algorithm will take time approximately  <span class="math">2^{2\\ell}</span> . (There will also be a slight speed-up from grouping together conjugate points as explained in [29, 107], but this is only by  <span class="math">\\sqrt{\\ell}</span> , and we are using rough asymptotic running times here.) So if Alice wants k bits of security she'll have to use  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  of order k/2. Nevertheless, she still wants to use an anomalous curve because she feels that its efficiency advantage is great enough to compensate for the need to choose  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  a little larger.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Meanwhile, Bob thinks that Alice is being unwise, because if he uses a random curve over the same type of field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{5\\ell}}</span>  with  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  prime, he can find a curve whose group order is twice a prime, in which case Pollard-rho will take time roughly  <span class="math">2^{2.5\\ell}</span> . That means that he can get the same k bits of security as Alice with  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  equal only to 0.4k.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Bob's reasoning made perfect sense throughout the 1990s. However, the study of Weil descent in [78] showed that the discrete log problem on a random curve over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{5\\ell}}</span>  can be reduced to the corresponding problem in the jacobian of a genus-15 or genus-16 curve over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{\\ell}}</span> , which, in turn, can be solved in time roughly  <span class="math">2^{2\\ell}</span> . This is asymptotically the same as the time for Pollard-rho on Alice's special curve. Thus, Bob took a bad gamble when he decided to use a random curve with a lower value of  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  than Alice's. He gets only 0.8k bits of security, not the k bits he thought he'd get.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In order to give two more examples of possible security disadvantages of randomness in ECC, we have to talk about isogenies.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">11.2. Isogenies and endomorphism rings. We shall give a brief overview of isogenies between elliptic curves. For proofs and details see [95, 106]. Let  <span class="math">E_1</span>  and  <span class="math">E_2</span>  be defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> . An isogeny  <span class="math">\\psi: E_1 \\longrightarrow E_2</span>  defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  is a non-constant rational map defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  that maps  <span class="math">\\infty</span>  to  <span class="math">\\infty</span> ; its degree is its degree as a rational map. If  <span class="math">\\psi</span>  is a separable isogeny, then the kernel of  <span class="math">\\psi</span>  is a subgroup of  <span class="math">E_1</span>  of order deg  <span class="math">\\psi</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Any isogeny  <span class="math">\\psi: E_1 \\longrightarrow E_2</span>  has a dual isogeny  <span class="math">\\widehat{\\psi}: E_2 \\longrightarrow E_1</span>  such that the composition  <span class="math">\\psi \\circ \\widehat{\\psi}</span>  is the endomorphism of multiplication by deg  <span class="math">\\psi</span> . We say that  <span class="math">E_1</span>  and  <span class="math">E_2</span>  are isogenous over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  if there exists an isogeny from one to the other that is defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> . A theorem of Tate states that  <span class="math">E_1</span>  and  <span class="math">E_2</span>  are isogenous over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  if and only if  <span class="math">\\#E_1(\\mathbb{F}_q) = \\#E_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;4</sup>An algorithm of Smith [99] allows one sometimes to transport the discrete logarithm problem on the jacobian of a genus-3 hyperelliptic curve to a non-hyperelliptic jacobian. For large  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  the procedure works for approximately 18% of all hyperelliptic curves. Smith's algorithm applies only to curves of genus 3 and fields of characteristic &gt; 3.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For example, suppose that  <span class="math">\\ell \\neq p</span>  is a prime, and C is a subgroup of  <span class="math">E_1</span>  of order  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  that is defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> . (Recall that this means that the subgroup C is fixed by the Frobenius map  <span class="math">\\phi: (x,y) \\mapsto (x^q,y^q)</span> , which can be true even if the individual points of C are not in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> .) For every such group C there is a degree- <span class="math">\\ell</span>  isogeny from  <span class="math">E_1</span>  to a curve  <span class="math">E_2</span>  defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  whose kernel is C.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The modular polynomial  <span class="math">\\Phi_{\\ell}[X,Y] \\in \\mathbb{Z}[X,Y]</span>  has the property that if we let  <span class="math">\\overline{\\Phi}_{\\ell}</span>  denote the reduction mod p and set Y equal to the j-invariant of  <span class="math">E_1</span> , then the  <span class="math">\\ell+1</span>  roots of  <span class="math">\\overline{\\Phi}_{\\ell}[X,j] \\in \\mathbb{F}_q[X]</span>  are the j-invariants of all of the curves  <span class="math">E_2</span>  that are  <span class="math">\\ell</span> -isogenous to  <span class="math">E_1</span>  over the algebraic closure  <span class="math">\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_q</span> . Each such isogeny corresponds to one of the  <span class="math">\\ell+1</span>  subgroups of order  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  in the group of  <span class="math">\\ell^2</span>  points of order  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  on  <span class="math">E_1(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_q)</span> . An  <span class="math">\\ell</span> -isogeny from a given curve can be quickly constructed if  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  is small; however, in general the best available algorithm [63] has running time roughly  <span class="math">\\ell^3</span> , so for large  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  the construction is not feasible.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let E be an elliptic curve defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> ,  <span class="math">q=p^f</span> , and let  <span class="math">t=q+1-\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span>  denote its trace. An endomorphism of E is an isogeny from E to itself that is defined over  <span class="math">\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_q</span> . The endomorphisms form a ring denoted  <span class="math">\\operatorname{End}(E)</span> . We consider the ordinary case when p does not divide t; in that case the elements of  <span class="math">\\operatorname{End}(E)</span>  are all defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> . Let  <span class="math">\\Delta=t^2-4q</span>  denote the discriminant of E. Then the complex multiplication (CM) field of E is  <span class="math">K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})</span> . We have  <span class="math">\\Delta=c_0^2d</span> , where d&lt;0 is the discriminant of the imaginary quadratic number field K. Let  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}_K</span>  denote the ring of integers; then  <span class="math">\\operatorname{End}(E)\\subset\\mathbb{Z}_K</span>  is an order in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}_K</span> . We let c denote the conductor of  <span class="math">\\operatorname{End}(E)</span> , i.e., its index in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}_K</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As before, let  <span class="math">\\phi</span>  denote the Frobenius endomorphism, given by  <span class="math">(x,y) \\mapsto (x^q,y^q)</span> . We regard  <span class="math">\\phi</span>  as an element of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}_K</span>  of norm q, since its characteristic polynomial is  <span class="math">T^2 - tT + q = 0</span> . The subring  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}[\\phi]</span>  has index  <span class="math">c_0 = \\sqrt{\\Delta/d}</span>  in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}_K</span> , and  <span class="math">\\operatorname{End}(E)</span>  is an order of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}_K</span>  that contains  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}[\\phi]</span> , and so its index in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}_K</span>  is a divisor c of  <span class="math">c_0</span> ,  <span class="math">1 \\le c \\le c_0</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The curves in the  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> -isogeny class of a given E can be partitioned according to their endomorphism ring, i.e., into &quot;endomorphism classes&quot; within the isogeny class. The endomorphism rings are the orders in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}_K</span>  that contain  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}[\\phi]</span> , and they are in one-to-one correspondence with the divisors c of  <span class="math">c_0</span> . The number of isomorphism classes of curves in a given endomorphism class is equal to the class number  <span class="math">h_c</span>  of the order, and this is approximately equal to  <span class="math">ch_K</span> , where  <span class="math">h_K</span>  is the class number of the imaginary quadratic CM field K (for a more precise formula, see [27], p. 123). The class number  <span class="math">h_K</span>  satisfies  <span class="math">h_K \\leq \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\sqrt{|d|} \\log |d|</span> , where d is the discriminant of K</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As mentioned before, the first use of isogenies was to develop improved methods of determining the group order of a random curve. More recently, isogenies have been used to investigate possible attacks on the elliptic curve discrete log problem. The idea is that if an isogeny can be computed between  <span class="math">E_1</span>  and  <span class="math">E_2</span> , then the discrete log problem on  <span class="math">E_1</span>  can be transported to the same problem on  <span class="math">E_2</span> . If it's feasible to construct isogenies between any two curves in a certain subset of the isogeny class, then the discrete log problem is  <span class="math">random\\ self-reducible</span>  in that subset of curves; this implies that the problem is equally difficult for all of those elliptic curves.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Suppose that starting with a curve  <span class="math">E_1</span>  in an endomorphism class with conductor c one randomly chooses an  <span class="math">\\ell</span> -isogeny  <span class="math">E_1 \\longrightarrow E_2</span> , where  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  is a small prime. Then</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;5</sup>In certain special cases there are faster methods [15], but they work only within a single <em>L</em>-conductor-gap class (this term is defined below) and so do not affect our argument.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">either  <span class="math">E_2</span>  is in the same endomorphism class as  <span class="math">E_1</span> , or else it has conductor  <span class="math">c\\ell</span>  or else  <span class="math">c/\\ell</span> . The last two possibilities can occur only if  <span class="math">\\ell|c_0</span> . The main result of [44] (assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis) is that a sequence of isogenies of prime degree  <span class="math">\\ell &lt; L = (\\log q)^{2+\\epsilon}</span>  (for fixed  <span class="math">\\epsilon</span> ),  <span class="math">(\\ell, c_0) = 1</span> , can be used to fan out randomly throughout the endomorphism class. (The precise statement is that the graph whose vertices are the isomorphism classes in a given endomorphism class with adjacency determined by these  <span class="math">\\ell</span> -isogenies is an expander graph.)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is also possible to use isogenies to go efficiently between two endomorphism classes, but only if they have a small conductor qap, by which we mean the largest prime that divides one conductor and not the other. Thus, if L is a bound on the size of primes  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  for which it is feasible to construct an  <span class="math">\\ell</span> -isogeny, it is natural to divide a given isogeny class into subsets that each consist of endomorphism classes with conductor gap &lt; L. Thus, in each isogeny class we define the L-conductor-gap class of a curve E to be the set of all endomorphism classes having conductor gap &lt; L with End(E). The result of [44] extends to these larger classes; that is, the discrete log problem is random self-reducible in each L-conductor-gap class. That means that if an efficient algorithm were found to solve the discrete log problem in time  <span class="math">T_1</span>  in a constant proportion  <span class="math">\\epsilon</span>  of all elliptic curves defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  (we shall call them &quot;weak&quot; curves), then the discrete log could be found on any curve in the L-conductor-gap class in time roughly  <span class="math">T_1 + T_2/\\epsilon</span> , where  <span class="math">T_2</span>  is the time required to construct an  <span class="math">\\ell</span> -isogeny,  <span class="math">\\ell &lt; L</span> . Here, of course, we're assuming that the property of being a weak curve for the discrete log algorithm is independent of isogeny class and endomorphism ring; and we're also assuming that the L-conductor-gap class contains  <span class="math">\\gg 1/\\epsilon</span>  curves.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that if  <span class="math">c_0 = 1</span>  (which is often the case) or if  <span class="math">c_0</span>  is L-smooth, then all  <span class="math">O(\\sqrt{p})</span>  curves in the isogeny class are in the same L-conductor-gap class. If  <span class="math">c_0</span>  is divisible by just a single large prime r, then there are two such classes: a small set of isomorphism classes of curves whose endomorphism ring has conductor not divisible by r, and the &quot;generic&quot; isomorphism classes where the endomorphism ring has conductor a multiple of r.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is the possibility of random isogeny walks through a conductor-gap class that under certain circumstances might make a generic curve less secure than a special curve. We discuss this in the next subsection.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Example 3.</strong> In V. M&uuml;ller's Table 6.2 of [84] the following is a choice of parameters suggested for ECC. Let  <span class="math">q = 2^{3.59}</span> , and let E be the curve defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_8</span>  by the equation</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$y^2 + xy = x^3 + x^2 + \\gamma,</span>$</p>

This curve has 6  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_8</span> -points, and its group of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{177}}</span> -points has order 6 times the 175-bit prime</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Suppose that Alice, following the suggestion of M&uuml;ller, chooses this curve E and extension field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{177}}</span> . She calculates that Pollard-rho (with the speed-up of  <span class="math">\\sqrt{59}</span>  in [29, 107]) would take roughly  <span class="math">2^{84}</span>  operations, i.e., the curve will give her 84 bits of security.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Bob, as usual, thinks that Alice is foolish for having chosen a curve with very special properties that allow the  <span class="math">\\sqrt{59}</span>  speed-up and may leave her vulnerable to</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">other attacks. He figures that if he chooses a random curve over the same field with group order twice a 176-bit prime, then he'll get 88 bits of security rather than 84, and he'll also be less vulnerable to unanticipated specialized attacks.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">At least through the 1990s Bob's reasoning would have appeared to be correct. But a closer examination using more recent research (see [78, 77]) shows that Bob might not have nearly the security level that he thinks he has.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The complex multiplication field for Alice's curve is  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-23})</span> , and the discriminant is  <span class="math">-23c_0^2</span>  with  <span class="math">c_0</span>  factoring as the product of two primes:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$c_0 = 11681 \\cdot 98766024850235972863.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In [77] Menezes and Teske found that a certain proportion &mdash; roughly  <span class="math">\\epsilon = 2^{-58}</span>  &mdash; of all elliptic curves over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{3\\cdot 59}}</span>  with group order  <span class="math">\\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}</span>  are &quot;weak&quot; in the sense that Weil descent can be used to transport the discrete log problem to the corresponding problem on the jacobian of a genus-3 hyperelliptic curve over  <span class="math">2^{59}</span> . At that point the discrete log problem can be solved in time roughly  <span class="math">2^{59\\cdot 4/3} \\approx 2^{79}</span>  [21].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In what follows we shall make the (plausible) assumption that the property of being a &quot;weak&quot; curve is independent of isogeny and endomorphism classes &mdash; in other words, that the expected number of weak curves in such a class is roughly equal to  <span class="math">\\epsilon = 2^{-58}</span>  times its cardinality.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Bob's case almost certainly the discriminant of his curve E is not divisible by the square of a large prime, and so it is possible to use isogenies to transport the discrete log problem on E along a &quot;random walk&quot; throughout its isogeny class. If his group order is  <span class="math">\\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}</span>  (of which there is a 50% chance), then after approximately  <span class="math">2^{58}</span>  isogenies we will have transported the discrete log problem to a curve where it can be solved in time roughly  <span class="math">2^{79}</span> . Each step in the &quot;walk&quot; takes time approximately  <span class="math">2^{17}</span> , so that the reduction to the weak curve will take time  <span class="math">\\approx 2^{75}</span> . In other words, Bob's random curve will have just 79 bits of security, not 88 bits as Bob thought and not even the 84 bits that Alice has.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In contrast, even if the result in [77] applied to curves in Alice's isogeny class (which it doesn't, since the number of points on her curve is  <span class="math">\\equiv 6 \\pmod 8</span> ), she'd still be safe because her curve's endomorphism ring has conductor 1 and is in a  <span class="math">2^{66}</span> -conductor-gap class containing fewer than  <span class="math">2^{16}</span>  curves (the ones with conductor 1 or 11681). Under our assumption that the &quot;weak&quot; property is independent of isogeny or endomorphism class, it is highly unlikely &mdash; a probability of about  <span class="math">2^{-42}</span> &mdash; that the discrete log problem on Alice's curve can be moved to a weak curve by a sequence of isogenies. In other words, what saves Alice from Bob's fate is precisely the very special nature of her curve.<sup>6</sup></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Most practical implementations of ECC in characteristic two use prime extension degrees, in which case Weil descent appears not to be useful (see [76]). However, it is not inconceivable that either a new version of Weil descent or some entirely different approach will some day lead to a faster-than-squareroot attack on a certain small (but non-negligible) proportion of elliptic curves defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> , where q is a</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;6</sup>In this discussion we are ignoring Gaudry's recent algorithm [30] for the discrete log on an elliptic curve over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^m}</span> ,  <span class="math">m \\geq 3</span>  (see &sect;10.2). However, in &sect;4.4 of [30] Gaudry says that, based on experimental results, he expects that his algorithm for m=3 will be faster than Pollardrho only for  <span class="math">q&gt;2^{65}</span> . In our example  <span class="math">q=2^{59}</span> , so at present we need not concern ourselves with Gaudry's algorithm. But of course improved implementations could result in that algorithm beating Pollard-rho in our case as well.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">prime power of 2. If we are using a curve over this field when this happens, we had better hope that our curve cannot be linked to a weak curve by means of isogenies.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Example 4.</strong> In 2000 in its Digital Signature Standard [85], NIST recommended ten elliptic curves over binary fields  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{\\ell}}</span>  with  <span class="math">\\ell = 163, 233, 283, 409, 571</span> . For each  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  they gave one random curve and one anomalous binary curve. The security level in the face of squareroot attacks is roughly  <span class="math">2^{\\ell/2}</span> . For instance, both curves over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{571}}</span>  should provide more than the 256 bits of security necessary to protect a high-security Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) private key.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This raises the question: Which of the two NIST curves over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{571}}</span>  is safer? The conventional wisdom would be that the random curve is the more conservative choice.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, let's suppose that a certain very small &mdash; but not negligible &mdash; fraction  <span class="math">\\epsilon</span>  of curves over this field could be attacked by some new faster-than-squareroot algorithm. We further suppose that the property of being a &quot;weak&quot; curve is independent of isogeny class or endomorphism class. In such a situation if our curve is in a large L-conductor-gap class, then after a &quot;random walk&quot; consisting of  <span class="math">O(1/\\epsilon)</span>  isogenies, an attacker can move the discrete log problem to a weak curve. A random curve is virtually certain to be in a large endomorphism class (since the discriminant of a random curve is very unlikely to be divisible by a large square). In particular, this is true of the random NIST curve over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{571}}</span> , whose discriminant is squarefree, i.e., all isogenous curves are in the same endomorphism class [44]. In contrast, the anomalous binary curve K-571 in [85] has discriminant  <span class="math">\\Delta = -7c_0^2</span> , where the conductor  <span class="math">c_0</span>  is the product of a 22-bit prime and a 263-bit prime, and its endomorphism ring has conductor 1. For  <span class="math">L = 2^{262}</span>  the L-conductor-gap class of the curve K-571 has approximately  <span class="math">2^{22}</span>  curves, so if  <span class="math">\\epsilon \\ll 2^{-22}</span> , this curve is likely to be safer than a random curve under our assumptions.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Weil descent methods are not applicable to curves defined over a prime field. But suppose that we're worried about the possibility that some new approach to the discrete log problem will turn out to give faster-than-squareroot algorithms for a certain proportion of curves defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> . Suppose also that the condition for a curve to be &quot;weak&quot; is likely to be independent of its isogeny or endomorphism class. In such a case we might want to choose our curve E over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  to be in a very small endomorphism class &mdash; more precisely, in a small L-conductor-gap class for fairly large L &mdash; so that an attacker could not use isogenies to transport the discrete log problem from our curve to a weak curve.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Example 5.</strong> Choose B to be a random k-bit prime, and choose A to be a random even number (perhaps also of k bits, but A may be chosen to have fewer bits) such that (i)  <span class="math">p = A^2 + B^2</span>  is prime, and (ii) either n = (p+1)/2 - A or n = (p+1)/2 + A is a prime. Heuristically one expects to have to test  <span class="math">O(k^2)</span>  values of A in order to obtain conditions (i) and (ii). Then the curve E over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  with equation</p>

Note that E has complex multiplication by the full ring of integers  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}[i]</span>  (since i acts on the curve by  <span class="math">(x,y) \\mapsto (-x,iy)</span> , where the latter occurrence of i denotes a square root of -1 in the finite field); that is,  <span class="math">\\operatorname{End}(E)</span>  has conductor 1. Up to isomorphism E is the only curve in its conductor-gap class, and the endomorphism ring of any of the other isogenous curves has conductor B.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The method of parameter selection in this example of course directly flouts the advice of Brainpool [71]. But whether it is reckless or wise to do this is at present far from clear.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our purpose in giving these examples is not to lobby for the use of special curves in preference to random ones. Rather, our point is that conventional wisdom may turn out to be wrong and that, as far as anyone knows, either choice has risks. The decision about what kind of curve to use in ECC is a subjective one based on the user's best guess about future vulnerabilities.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As frequently happens in cryptography, a close examination of a commonly accepted viewpoint on security issues reveals that opposing opinions or interpretations cannot be ruled out. Much as we might wish to convey to the outside world an impression of self-confidence and mathematical certainty about our recommendations (see &sect;2), there is ample reason to wonder whether this self-confidence is justified.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-misc-6" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">12. PATH DEPENDENCE</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In [72] MacKenzie and Wajcman discuss what they call the <em>path-dependence</em> of technical change:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Technologies often manifest increasing returns to adoption. The processes of learning by doing and by using... and the frequent focus of inventive effort on removing weak points... from existing technologies, mean that the very process of adoption tends to improve the performance of those technologies that are adopted. This gives the history, especially the early history, of a technology considerable significance. Early adoptions, achieved for whatever reason, can be built into what may become irreversible superiority over rivals, because success tends to breed success and rejection can turn into neglect and therefore permanent inferiority. The history of technology is a path-dependent history, one in which past events exercise continuing influences. Which of two or more technologies eventually succeeds is not determined by their intrinsic characteristics alone, but also by their histories of adoption. The technology that triumphs is not necessarily abstractly best.... Pathdependence means that local, short-term contingencies can exercise lasting effects.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>12.1. <strong>Historical what-ifs.</strong> One of the best ways to refute the technological determinist view of the history of cryptography that is implicit in the Ideal Model (see the last paragraph of &sect;2) is to ask some hypothetical questions of the form &quot;What if...?&quot;</li>
      <li>What if in 1977 someone who had just written a Ph.D. thesis on elliptic curves had happened to read the classic article [23] that had appeared the year before? Fortunately for RSA, that appears not to have happened, since it probably would</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">have occurred to such a person to suggest replacing the multiplicative group of a finite field by the group of points of an elliptic curve, and ECC would have been born eight years before 1985. In 1977 subexponential algorithms were already known for the integer factorization problem. The elliptic curve discrete log problem thus would have struck everyone as a much harder problem, and hence the one-way function in ECC would have appeared to be much safer for the construction of public key protocols. There would have been little reason for anyone to adopt RSA.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>What if the ideas described in &sect;10 for finding discrete logs on an elliptic curve E over Fq<sup>m</sup> &mdash; Weil descent followed by index calculus on a jacobian group, or index calculus directly on E using points with x-coordinate in F<sup>q</sup> as the factor base had been proposed in the late 1980s or early 1990s? At that time it was generally assumed that any finite field could be used in ECC, and the choice should depend only on convenience. In fact, some people proposed using fields of the form Fq<sup>m</sup> with q a prime or a power of 2 of intermediate size (say, 8 or 32 bits). The fasterthan-squareroot and even subexponential algorithms for some elliptic curves over such &quot;weak&quot; fields would have come as a shock, and opponents of ECC could have easily used the discovery of such algorithms as a reason not to have confidence in elliptic curves. As it happened, however, by the late 1990s implementers were almost exclusively using either prime fields or prime degree extensions of F2, to which those algorithms do not apply.</li>
      <li>What if pairing-based cryptography had been proposed just three or four years earlier, say in 1997 when &quot;ECC Central&quot; on the RSA website was warning of the dangers of ECC? The elliptic curve skeptics would have had a field day! &quot;The ECC promoters are now using the very same low-embedding-degree elliptic curves that five years ago they acknowledged to be insecure and recommended avoiding!&quot; they would have said. Some people would have hoped that by undermining confidence in pairing-based cryptography they might be able to bring down all of ECC with it. However, by 2001 the big rivalry between RSA and ECC was largely over, and hardly anyone wanted to reopen that debate.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">These hypothetical questions show that the particular chronology of RSA, ECC, pairing-based cryptography, and new algorithms for factoring and discrete logs has a lot to do with the history of the paradigm shift to ECC.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">12.2. Narrative inversion. In historical studies one often finds a wide gap between the image that a nation or group has of its past &mdash; the historical narrative and what the record shows. In extreme cases it sometimes seems that the farther this narrative is from reality, the more adamantly people repeat it and insist on its validity. This is narrative inversion.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Take the hypothetical example of a country whose official version of its history is that the guiding principle of its foreign policy has been to &quot;defend freedom.&quot; Even though people in other countries might see an ever-widening chasm between this national myth and the reality, the narrative continues to be a centerpiece of the belief system of millions of people, who proclaim it with increasing fervor.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the world of scholarship as well, one often encounters narrative inversion. Take, for example, the word science. Often the humanistic and social areas whose practitioners are the most insistent on using this word are those fields that have the worst track record in attempting to use scientific methodology. In the last century the term &quot;social studies&quot; was replaced by &quot;social sciences,&quot; and departments of government became departments of &quot;political science.&quot; Interestingly, the one profession in social studies that arguably uses a fair amount of scientific methodology and does it competently &mdash; history &mdash; has never insisted on changing its name to &quot;historical science.&quot;</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">12.3. Narrative inversion in cryptography. Modern cryptography can be viewed as an applied science in the overlap between mathematics and computer science. Nevertheless, the development of various technologies for implementing secure communications continues to be as much a story of chance occurrences, mistaken interpretations, zigzags, blunders, and strokes of good luck as was the cryptography of old. It seems impossible to remove the element of contingency &mdash; of intuition and of craft.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Part of the reason why cryptography has such a strong subjective element is that speculation is central to the field. When deciding on the basic type of cryptography to use (RSA or ECC, for example), when choosing the type of protocol for a given application (e.g., whether or not to use identity-based encryption), and when selecting parameters (for instance, random generation versus enhanced efficiency), one has to make a guess about future developments in order to evaluate the fundamental issue of safety of the system. One has to ask: What type of adversaries are we likely to encounter, and what will be their most likely avenues of attack? Will there be any breakthroughs in bringing down the asymptotic running time to solve any of the supposedly intractable mathematical problems? Will quantum computing (see [94]) ever become practical? What new &quot;side-channel&quot; attacks (see [2, 9, 61, 62]) might be devised?</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Perhaps it is because of this highly contingent element in the field that researchers increasingly feel the need to go out of their way to assure the public that it is rapidly becoming a science, that ironclad guarantees of security can be given (&quot;provable security&quot;), and that cryptographers faithfully follow the Ideal Model described in &sect;2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Among the leading researchers in cryptography, Mihir Bellare (coinventor of the subdiscipline of practice-oriented provable security) has a relatively moderate view of the scientific nature of the field. On the one hand, he acknowledges that the search for suitable mathematical one-way functions &mdash; what he calls atomic primitives &mdash; has a large element of artistry [6]. But on the other hand, he thinks that the part of cryptography concerned with constructing usable cryptosystems based on these primitives is becoming a science:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">...I'd like to claim that the design of protocols can be made a science. [6]</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Other theoreticians, writing more recently, are categorical in their rejection of any notion that cryptography is not fully a science. In response to comments in [57] questioning the claims of &quot;provable security&quot; and suggesting that cryptography is &quot;more an art than a science,&quot; Oded Goldreich [33] stated that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">...cryptographic research is indeed part of science. [emphasis in original]</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">And in the preface to their recent book [47] Jonathan Katz and Yehuda Lindell insisted that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">...cryptographic constructions can be proven secure with respect to a clearly-stated definition of security and relative to a well-defined cryptographic assumption. This is the essence of modern cryptography, and what has transformed cryptography from an art to a science. The importance of this idea cannot be over-emphasized. [emphasis in original]</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As in other cases of narrative inversion, these belabored claims inevitably bring to mind the famous line from Hamlet</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The lady doth protest too much, methinks.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Until the work of Thomas Kuhn a half century ago, the term Scientific Revolution, used in the singular, referred to the birth of modern science in the 16th and 17th centuries. Kuhn, whose most famous book [66] appeared in 1962, used the term &quot;scientific revolutions&quot; in the plural to refer to the radical shifts of point of view that have punctuated the history of science. It was Kuhn who coined the term &quot;paradigm shift&quot; for this process &mdash; a term that was later used in many areas outside the sciences.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Before Kuhn's work, the most common view among historians was that science and technology progressed steadily toward a more accurate and complete understanding of the natural world. Mistakes were often made &mdash; and one could frequently find social and political explanations for the backward steps &mdash; but the overall pattern was to build upon the edifice constructed by earlier generations, &quot;standing on the shoulders of giants&quot; in Newton's famous formulation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Kuhn, however, believed that the most important developments in the history of science occur by means of a radical challenge to earlier conceptions. In his view social and professional influences have a great effect on the direction of science as a whole, and should not be invoked simply to explain the &quot;mistakes.&quot; In fact, he believed in what later came to be called the &quot;symmetry principle,&quot; which states that historians should use the same methods to study the emergence of a scientific theory or school of thought independently of whether modern science regards the theory as correct or incorrect.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the years after Kuhn's book appeared, this methodological principle was carried much further by other historians and philosophers, who started advocating a type of scientific relativism, according to which science has no more objective validity than anything else. Science, according to this view, is &quot;socially constructed&quot; just as literature, politics, and religion are. The relativist tendency in thinking about science was most pronounced among postmodernists such as Jacques Lacan, Paul Feyerabend, Vandana Shiva, and Bruno Latour.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the 1980s and 1990s as this tendency grew in strength among academics in the humanities and social studies, some scientists started to take notice. Most reacted with horror and anger at what the postmodern writers were saying. Some, such as Holton [38] and Gross and Levitt [35], published refutations. Journalists often referred to the debate as the &quot;science wars.&quot;</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The culmination of the scientists' counterattack on postmodern writings on science came in the form of a hoax &mdash; perhaps the most successful hoax in the history of academic writing. After two months of studying the relevant literature, physicist Alan Sokal wrote a parody of the postmodern science studies jargon in the form of an article on the &quot;hermeneutics&quot; of quantum gravity. He submitted it to the journal Social Text for publication. Astoundingly, the caricature was accepted, and his article [100] appeared in the Spring/Summer 1996 issue of the journal.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Sokal's hoax and subsequent critiques [14, 101] were directed against an extreme form of &quot;science studies.&quot; But even the more moderate sociologists of science sometimes write in a style that reveals an unmistakable undercurrent of resentment and pique toward the sciences and technology. For example, in his introduction to the book &quot;Technology and Social Process,&quot; B. Elliott [25] says:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Running through many of the chapters in this book... there is a concern to demystify technology. The social studies of science have shown us that the closer we get to the laboratories, to the dayto-day practice of science, and the more intimately we explore the social processes through which scientific knowledge is constituted, the less in awe of it we stand. We appreciate the looseness of its boundaries, the contested nature of its claims. Scientific research turns out to be much messier than we had perhaps supposed, its development less the product of logical and rational progression than the product of hunches, improbable connections and various struggles for power. In consequence we grow more skeptical of claims that may be made for its special, privileged status and more critical of various forms of scientific determinism. And so it is, and should be, with technology.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is tempting for scientists to revel in Sokal's spoof of the nonsensical jargon of the postmodernists, react with annoyance to the tone of sociologists of science such as Elliott, and dismiss as ridiculous any attempt to describe a school of scientific thought as a &quot;social construct.&quot; But that would be a mistake.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">There have been many studies of the effects of such social factors as race, class, and gender on the content of scientific theories. In some areas of the sciences especially those connected with human behavior &mdash; and in many areas of technology these studies have exposed serious methodological failings.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This work in the history and sociology of science and technology on occasion can be fascinating &mdash; and it can be especially entertaining when gender bias is involved. In the sciences the influence of gender has been most pronounced in such fields as primatology, endocrinology, embryology, archaeology, and sociobiology. We'll give brief (and admittedly superficial) descriptions of three examples.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">13.1. Gorillas. The field of primatology emerged toward the end of the 19th century in the wake of Darwin's pathbreaking work on natural selection and evolution, which was popularly known as the theory that &quot;man descended from apes.&quot; For close to a century most primatologists visualized ape family life as conforming to Victorian views of gender roles. A now-classic example of this tendency could be seen in the primate hall of the American Museum of Natural History, which featured a majestic male silverback gorilla towering over and guarding his much smaller mate and their offspring. This memorable tableau directly replicated the stereotypical Victorian nuclear family in the primate world. Unstated anywhere in the exhibit was the fact that several large female gorillas had been shot in the mistaken belief that they were males worthy of being stuffed for the Museum. Unstated also was the fact that such a scene of a nuclear ape family would have been highly unlikely in nature [36]. It wasn't until the 1960s and 1970s, with the rise of secondwave feminism and the entrance of a new generation of women into the profession, that primatologists began to systematically question the patriarchal assumptions of their older colleagues and point out that primates exhibit a surprising variety of social organizations, parenting strategies, dominance hierarchies, and male/female relations [39, 103].</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>13.2. The Hohokam. A more recent and equally amusing example of gender bias can be found in a currently fashionable trend in the study of the prehistoric Southwest of the U.S. A group of archaeologists led by Steven LeBlanc of Harvard and David Wilcox of the Museum of Northern Arizona have developed an elaborate theory of endemic warfare among the ancient Hohokam peoples of central Arizona (see [50, 51]). Wilcox and his coauthors describe how, while talking late at night around a campfire, they arrived at their &quot;exciting&quot; conclusions, which seem to be the result of lively imagination stimulated by male-to-male comradery rather than any scholarly deductions. They recount with awe and describe as &quot;scientific&quot; the &quot;seminal ideas&quot; supplied by a much-decorated veteran of the Vietnam War who visited the sites with Wilcox. Although there is scant evidence for any warfare among the Hohokam, let alone battles of epic proportions, this group of archaeologists has insisted on a version of prehistory that appears to have more to do with a modern American culture of aggressive masculinity than with the actual interactions among peoples in 14th-century Arizona.</li>
      <li>13.3. Smart houses. Examples of gender bias abound in technology. For example, the much-hyped &quot;smart house&quot; was analyzed in a delightful article by Anne-Jorunn Berg [7]. On the face of it, one would expect that efforts to automate household processes would naturally incorporate input from women, who are the primary users of technology within the home. Berg found, however, that &quot;smart house&quot; designers had been remarkably uninterested in grappling with such labor-intensive activities as cooking, cleaning and childcare. Instead, designers had concentrated on getting peripheral technologies to &quot;talk&quot; to one another through central control stations: getting lights to turn on automatically, arranging voice-activated controls for entertainment systems, etc. The closest any of the projects had come to a basic household task was the &quot;robobutler,&quot; which could supposedly serve drinks. But the drinks must first be made by a human and set precisely on the robobutler's tray, at which point the robobutler could be remotely guided into the livingroom by controls much like those used for toy boats and planes. In other words, this technology was a &quot;toy for the boys&quot; rather than a true labor-saving advance. The core tasks that make housework so time-consuming remained untouched.</li>
      <li>13.4. The social study of technology. The social study of technology has become a subfield in its own right relatively recently &mdash; a decade or two after the emergence of the social study of science. Sociologists of technology have usually avoided the pitfalls of jargon and over-generalization that have plagued writers on the social construction of science. In part this is a conscious strategy adopted in order to avoid a repetition of the &quot;science wars.&quot; In the preface to the 1999 edition of their book [72] MacKenzie and Wajcman warn their colleagues not to repeat the mistakes of sociologists of science:</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We fear a rerun in the social studies of technology of what has happened in the social studies of science. There, in the 1970s and 1980s, a variety of empirical studies... offered evidence that the content of scientific knowledge was influenced by the social circumstances of its production..... Those who produced this work knew well that the evidence was partial, tentative and patchy, and that the conceptual issues involved were poorly understood, but a wider audience of scholars in the humanities and social sciences grasped eagerly at the conclusion that scientific knowledge was 'a social construct'. The notion became something of a premature orthodoxy, and too little was done to clarify what the ambiguous phrase meant.... In consequence, when some natural scientists reacted with hostility to the notion of social construction (in the 'science wars' debate...), the field was not as well placed as it might have been.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In addition, it is easier for sociologists of technology to get a sympathetic reception from practitioners, because most leaders of the field are fully conscious of the role that economic, social and political factors play in the adoption of certain technologies and the rejection of others. A famous example was Thomas Edison (see [40, 41]), who was as much an entrepreneur as an inventor. Few technologists would see their work as being entirely removed from the cultural environment. In contrast, researchers in the basic sciences &mdash; especially the physical sciences and mathematics &mdash; tend to see their work as a process of discovering a set of truths that transcend the exigencies of the moment.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However theoreticians in math and physics might view their work, practitioners in applied fields such as cryptography would have to be very naive in order to believe that their ideas and protocols have some sort of intrinsic value apart from human culture. It is quite a stretch to visualize RSA or ECC inhabiting a realm of Platonic Ideals side-by-side with the perfect circle, the Pythagorean theorem, and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">13.5. Conclusion. To what extent can ideas from &quot;social construction of technology&quot; help us to understand the paradigm shift from RSA to ECC? Certain broad social categories do not appear to be relevant to this history; to the best of our knowledge questions of gender, race, or class have nothing to do with this story. It is perhaps particularly surprising that gender has played no discernible role, since the popular history of cryptography is intimately tied up with the military and is full of male-dominated stories of intrigue. Certainly David Kahn's famous history of cryptography [46] has a notably sexist slant:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Four officers in GY [the cryptanalysis section of U.S. Navy intelligence in 1941], assisted by chief petty officers, stood round-the-clock watches.... GY had others on its staff, such as girl typists who also did the simple deciphering of some diplomatic messages after the watch officers and other cryptanalysts had found the keys. ([46], p. 11)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Nevertheless, we are aware of no examples of gender, race, or class bias influencing the direction of public key cryptography.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Nor are we aware of evidence that women are especially put off by the disciplinary culture of the field &mdash; any more than in other areas of computer science, engineering, and mathematics. In fact, the proportion of prominent women researchers is probably greater than that in most of the allied fields of science. This flies in the face of some currently popular notions about women in science, according to which women by nature avoid fields where conflict and confrontation are common (see, for example, [5, 32]). In the case of cryptography, adversarial behavior is central to the very definition of the subject, and the &quot;spy vs. spy&quot; mentality of intense rivalry often seems to permeate the research community as well. Heated disputes might involve the relative merits of different types of cryptography or of different approaches to evaluating them, or such mundane matters as which of several contending research groups deserves credit for advancing a particular subfield.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Just as we reject technological determinism, we should also avoid a type of equally simplistic sociological determinism that is sometimes called <em>essentialism</em>. In thinking about disciplines such as cryptography, some feminist theoreticians would reason more or less as follows: &quot;Women by their nature are less confrontational and militaristic than men, and hence are less likely to be attracted to a field whose entire purpose is to combat adversarial behavior.&quot; And postmodern feminist philosophers of science would also see a gender subtext in the debate over whether cryptography is more a science or an art. They would most likely claim that the very term &quot;science&quot; is so tied to masculinity that some cryptographers' fixation on the word &quot;science&quot; to describe their field (see &sect;12.3) is <em>prima facie</em> evidence of a male bias. (See [49] for a discussion of some of the fallacies in postmodern feminist views of science.)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Similarly, in trying to explain the dramatic contrast between the recommendations of Brainpool and of Voltage (see &sect;11) some might be tempted to resort to popular stereotypes of national character: &quot;Germans are risk-averse by nature, whereas Americans have a penchant for high-stakes gambling, so that's why German-led Brainpool was extra-cautious, whereas the American security company Voltage happily endorsed a supersingular curve.&quot; In our opinion such attempts at explanation based on gender or national character are far-fetched and untenable.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The social influences on the course of public key cryptography appear to have come not from such broad categories as gender, race, class, or nationality, but rather from certain aspects of the professional culture. This is not unusual in the history of technology. As MacKenzie and Wajcman put it,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">...'social shaping' does not necessarily involve reference to wider societal relations such as those of class, gender and ethnicity. These are sometimes directly crucial... but often what is more immediately relevant are 'local' considerations, such as engineers' membership of professional communities, the reward structures of those communities, and so on. ([72], pp. 18-19)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our examination of the history of ECC offers no support to those who would argue that technology follows an inevitable path that is independent of societal constraints. Rather, the evidence points toward ways in which technology is socially constructed:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>path-dependence the importance of timing, the role of happenstance;</li>
      <li>the role of the military in intervening at crucial stages to send the technology in a different direction from that favored by market forces;</li>
      <li><em>closure</em> the need eventually to reach a consensus and stop most debate, even if some basic questions remain unanswered;</li>

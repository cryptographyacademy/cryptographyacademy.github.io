      <p class="text-gray-300">We discuss irreducible polynomials that can be
used to speed up square root extraction in fields of characteristic two.
We call such polynomials \\textit{square root friendly}.
The obvious applications are to point halving methods for elliptic curves
and divisor halving methods for hyperelliptic curves.

We note the existence of square root friendly trinomials of a given
degree when we already know that an irreducible trinomial of the same
degree exists, and formulate a conjecture on the degrees of the terms of
square root friendly polynomials.
We also give a partial result
that goes in the direction of the conjecture.

Irreducible polynomials $p(X)$ such that the square root
$\\zeta$ of a zero $x$ of $p(X)$ is a sparse polynomial are considered
and those for which $\\zeta$ has minimal degree are characterized.
In doing this we discover a surprising connection
these polynomials
and those defining polynomial bases
with an extremal number of trace one elements.

We also show how to improve the speed of solving quadratic equations and
that the increase in the time required to perform modular reduction is
marginal and does not affect performance adversely.
Experimental results confirm that the new polynomials mantain their
promises; These results generalize work by Fong et al.\\ to polynomials
other than trinomials.  Point halving gets a speed-up of $20\\%$ and the
performance of scalar multiplication based on point halving is improved
by at least $11\\%$.</p>

    </section>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The main topics of this paper are square root extraction and trace computation in binary fields, even though also the solution of quadratic equations is briefly considered.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In [19] it is shown that square root extraction can be accelerated if a suitable irreducible trinomial is used to define a field extension of F2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let P(X) be the irreducible polynomial of degree d used to define the extension field F<sup>2</sup> <sup>d</sup> /F2. If the polynomial in X representing the square root of a zero x in F<sup>2</sup> <sup>d</sup> has low weight and/or degree, then general square roots can be extracted in F<sup>2</sup> <sup>d</sup> efficiently. In this case we call P(X) square root friendly. (This definition will be made more precise later.)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We give here sufficient conditions for an irreducible polynomial of odd degree d to yield a low weight  <span class="math">\\sqrt{x}</span> . In particular, we give examples of pentanomials and heptanomials, but in at least one case, that of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{233}}</span> , that can be defined by trinomials, we show how one can perform square root computations even faster than in [19].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since the main motivation comes from elliptic curve cryptography (cf. [9, 20]), in particular from point halving based methods for scalar multiplication, we recall here the involved concepts.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let E be an elliptic curve defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^d}</span>  by a Weierstrass equation</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$E: Y^2 + XY = X^3 + aX^2 + b</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">with  <span class="math">a, b \\in \\mathbb{F}_{2^d}</span>  and having a subgroup  <span class="math">G \\leq E(\\mathbb{F}_{2^d})</span>  of large prime order. Given a point  <span class="math">\\mathbf{P} \\in G</span>  point halving [22, 27], consists in computing the unique point  <span class="math">\\mathbf{R}</span>  whose double is  <span class="math">\\mathbf{P}</span> . Halving is an automorphism of G. To perform this operation one needs to solve a quadratic equation of the form  <span class="math">\\lambda^2 + \\lambda + \\alpha = 0</span>  for  <span class="math">\\lambda</span> , extract a square root, perform two multiplications, a trace computation, and some additions. We refer the reader to [22, 27, 19] for details, including the usage of halving in place of doubling in scalar multiplication algorithms. According to [19], halving is about two times faster than doubling.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Birkner [13] has a divisor halving formula for genus two curves based on the Lange-Stevens doubling formulae [24]. Birkner and Th&eacute;riault [14] deal with genus three divisors. The performance of all known halving formul&aelig; depends (to a variable degree) on the performance of square root extraction. Further uses of point halving to speed up scalar multiplication on (elliptic) Koblitz Curves [23] are found in [7, 10] and [11].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The paper is divided in two parts, the first one about mathematical aspects (Section 2) and the second part about implementation issues and performance (Section 3).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In &sect;2.1 we give background material about square roots, In &sect;2.2 we classify the odd degree polynomials with low degree  <span class="math">\\sqrt{x}</span>  and consider the trace spectra of the corresponding polynomial bases. &sect;2.3 deals with the even degree polynomials. A somewhat surprising observation stemming from the results in &sect;&sect;2.2 and 2.3 is that polynomials with low degree  <span class="math">\\sqrt{x}</span>  substantially coincide with those characterised by a maximal or minimal number of trace one elements in the associated polynomial basis.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Polynomials for several binary fields used for cryptographic applications are presented in &sect; 2.4, together with observations about the scarcity of other types of polynomials with similar properties, a result about the existence of square root friendly trinomials, a conjecture about the degrees of the non-leading terms of square root friendly polynomials, and a theorem that supports the conjecture itself.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, we move to practical aspects. Not only square root extraction is implemented (&sect; 3.1), but also the computation of traces over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2</span>  (&sect; 3.2) and solving quadratic equations in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^d}</span>  (&sect; 3.3). These routines are benchmarked showing gains, whereas multiplication and squaring either experience a negligible slowdown or even a minimal speedup. The costs of various elliptic curve group operations and scalar multiplication algorithms using different reduction polynomials for the definition field are also given. The discussion of these results (&sect; 3.4) also provides the conclusion to the paper. In particular, we prove that a performance gain of around 20% can be expected for the point halving alone, with a speed increase in excess of 11% for scalar multiplication.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-2.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2.1 Background</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let P(X) be an irreducible polynomial of <em>odd</em> degree d, and the field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^d}</span>  be constructed as  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2[X]/(P(X))</span> . Let x be a zero of P(X) in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^d}</span> . We consider here polynomial basis representation because we are solely concerned with software applications.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Whereas with a normal basis [4] a square root computation is just a shift of the bits internal representation of the field element by one position, whose cost is basically negligible with respect to that of a multiplication, matters are different with polynomial bases. Even the cost of a squaring becomes no longer negligible. Indeed, if  <span class="math">\\alpha = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} a_i x^i</span> , then  <span class="math">\\alpha^2 = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} a_i x^{2i}</span>  need to be reduced modulo P(X). The costs are low, but cannot be completely ignored.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Things are more complicated for square roots. Even though squaring just consists in &quot;spacing&quot; the bits of the original element with zeros, the bits of a generic field element cannot be just &quot;compressed&quot;. Using Fermat's little theorem  <span class="math">\\alpha^{2^d} = \\alpha</span> , we can compute  <span class="math">\\sqrt{\\alpha} = \\alpha^{2^{d-1}}</span> . This requires d-1 squarings, and for large d the cost is that of several field multiplications. In fact, it can be faster to change to a normal basis (we</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">need only to store the change-of-base matrix: the conversion time is then approximately equivalent to one field multiplication, and this method requires to store  <span class="math">O(d^2)</span>  bits [21] &ndash; see also [18]), perform the square root extraction in that representation, then convert back to polynomial basis.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A more efficient method stems from the observation that  <span class="math">\\sqrt{\\alpha}</span>  can be expressed in terms of  <span class="math">\\zeta := \\sqrt{x}</span> . If</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\alpha = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} a_i x^i</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">we separate the even exponents from the odd exponents</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\alpha = \\sum_{i=0}^{(d-1)/2} a_{2i} x^{2i} + \\sum_{i=0}^{(d-3)/2} a_{2i+1} x^{2i+1} = (\\alpha_{\\text{even}})^2 + x \\cdot (\\alpha_{\\text{odd}})^2</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\alpha_{\\text{even}} = \\sum_{i=0}^{(d-1)/2} a_{2i} x^i</span>$
and  <span class="math">\\alpha_{\\text{odd}} = \\sum_{i=0}^{(d-3)/2} a_{2i+1} x^i</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and, since square root in a field of even characteristic is a linear operation:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\sqrt{\\alpha} = \\alpha_{\\text{even}} + \\zeta \\cdot \\alpha_{\\text{odd}} \\tag{1}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Therefore, once  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  has been computed on a per-field basis, the computation of a generic square root is reduced to &quot;bits extraction and packing&quot;, a &quot;rectangular&quot; multiplication of a degree  <span class="math">\\leq d-1</span>  polynomial  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  with a polynomial  <span class="math">\\sum_{i=0}^{(d-3)/2} a_{2i+1}x^i</span>  of degree  <span class="math">\\leq (d-1)/2</span>  in x, and a modular reduction. Intuitively, the cost should approach a half of the cost of a field multiplication and this is confirmed by the analysis in [19, 22].</p>

      <h3 id="sec-2.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2.2 Square-Root Friendly Polynomials (Mostly Odd Degree)</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let the extension degree d be odd. The speed of square root computation depends on the efficiency of the multiplication of a generic polynomial of degree  <span class="math">\\leq (d-1)/2</span>  by  <span class="math">\\zeta = \\sqrt{x}</span> . Now, if  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  as a polynomial is x is very sparse, for example of weight two or four (i.e. it has just two or four nonzero terms), then this product can be computed by a few shift and XOR operations. In [19] two types of trinomials have been shown that allow this. The kind that interests us is</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$P(X) = X^d + X^m + 1</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">with m odd. Then  <span class="math">x = x^{d+1} + x^{m+1}</span>  with d+1 and m+1 even, and</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\zeta = x^{(d+1)/2} + x^{(m+1)/2} ,</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and P(X) is square root friendly. In fact, this idea is much more general. Assume the irreducible polynomial P(X) defining  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^d}</span>  over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2</span>  has form</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$P(X) = X \\cdot \\mathcal{U}(X)^2 + 1 \\tag{2}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">\\mathcal{U}</span>  is a polynomial of degree (d-1)/2 and even weight w (hence P(X) has weight w+1). Then,  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  has a very simple form in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^d}</span> : from  <span class="math">x^2 \\cdot \\mathcal{U}(x)^2 + x = 0</span>  we obtain</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\zeta = x \\cdot \\mathcal{U}(x) .</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  is represented by a polynomial of degree 1 + (d-1)/2 = (d+1)/2 and weight w. Furthermore, note that the <em>polynomial</em> product</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\zeta \\cdot \\sum_{i=0}^{(d-3)/2} a_{2i+1} x^i</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">has degree bounded by (d+1)/2+(d-3)/2=d-1, therefore no polynomial reduction is required if a square root is computed by formula (1). Hence, irreducible polynomials of form (2) are square root friendly.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that the low degree of  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  not only guarantees that no modular reduction is necessary, but puts also a bound on the complexity of the multiplication by  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  (even though its sparseness has an even bigger influence). It is therefore interesting to ask whether there are irreducible polynomials P(X) that lead to a  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  of even lower degree. This cannot happen, and requiring the degree of the polynomial representing  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  to be at most (d+1)/2 in fact almost characterizes the polynomials (2).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 1.</strong> Let the field extension  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^d}/\\mathbb{F}_2</span>  be defined by an irreducible polynomial P(X) of odd degree d, and let x be a zero of P(X) in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^d}</span> . Suppose that  <span class="math">\\zeta := \\sqrt{x}</span>  is a polynomial of degree at most (d+1)/2 in x.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Then the degree of  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  is exactly (d+1)/2 and either</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>(i)  <span class="math">P(X) = 1 + X \\cdot \\mathcal{U}(X)^2</span>  and  <span class="math">\\zeta = x \\cdot \\mathcal{U}(x)</span>  for some  <span class="math">\\mathcal{U}(X) \\in \\mathbb{F}_2[X]</span>  of degree exactly (d-1)/2; or</li>
      <li>(ii)  <span class="math">P(X) = 1 + (X+1) \\cdot X^2 \\cdot W(X)^2</span>  and  <span class="math">\\zeta = 1 + (x+1) \\cdot x \\cdot W(x)</span>  for some  <span class="math">W(X) \\in \\mathbb{F}_2[X]</span>  of degree exactly (d-3)/2.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof.</em> Let  <span class="math">\\zeta = \\mathcal{V}(x)</span>  where  <span class="math">\\mathcal{V}(X) \\in \\mathbb{F}_2[X]</span> . Suppose that  <span class="math">\\deg \\mathcal{V} \\leq (d-1)/2</span> . Then the relation  <span class="math">\\zeta = \\mathcal{V}(x)</span>  implies  <span class="math">\\mathcal{V}(x)^2 + x = 0</span>  and thus x would be a zero of the polynomial  <span class="math">\\mathcal{V}(X)^2 + X</span>  of degree at most d-1, contradicting the fact that x has degree d.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">From now on let deg  <span class="math">\\mathcal{V} = (d+1)/2</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If  <span class="math">X \\mid \\mathcal{V}(X)</span> , then x is a root of  <span class="math">1 + \\mathcal{V}(X)^2/X</span>  that has degree d and is therefore equal to P(X). We are in the first case with  <span class="math">\\mathcal{U}(X) = \\mathcal{V}(X)/X</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Now let  <span class="math">X \\nmid \\mathcal{V}(X)</span> , which implies  <span class="math">\\mathcal{V}(0) = 1</span> . Since x is a root of  <span class="math">X + \\mathcal{V}(X)^2</span>  it is  <span class="math">P(X) \\mid X + \\mathcal{V}(X)^2</span>  and and  <span class="math">(X+1) \\cdot P(X) = (X + \\mathcal{V}(X)^2)</span> . We add X+1 to both sides of the last equality and exploit the linearity of squaring to get  <span class="math">(X+1) \\cdot (1+P(X)) = (1+\\mathcal{V}(X))^2</span> . In turn this implies that X+1 divides  <span class="math">1+\\mathcal{V}(X)</span> , and since  <span class="math">X \\mid 1+P(X)</span> , also X divides  <span class="math">1+\\mathcal{V}(X)</span> . Hence we are in the second case.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 1.</strong> An irreducible polynomial of form (2) is called a special square root friendly (SSRF) polynomial of type I.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">An irreducible polynomial</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$P(X) = 1 + (X+1) \\cdot X^2 \\cdot W(X)^2</span>$
(3)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">for some  <span class="math">W(X) \\in \\mathbb{F}_2[X]</span>  of degree exactly (d-3)/2 is called a special square root friendly polynomial of type II.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Example 1. The irreducible polynomial  <span class="math">X^{163} + X^{57} + X^{49} + X^{29} + 1</span>  is of type I, and the corresponding  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  has weight four. On the other hand, the standard NIST polynomial [26]  <span class="math">X^{163} + X^7 + X^6 + X^3 + 1</span>  defines a  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  of weight 79 (cf. Appendix A).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We do not know whether there are other families of irreducible polynomials which are not trinomials, not of one of the forms (2) or (3), and for which  <span class="math">\\sqrt{x}</span>  has small weight. Even for trinomials  <span class="math">X^d + X^m + 1</span>  with even m one has to check on a case by case basis, but examples are known [19].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Still, SSRF polynomials abound: see &sect; 2.4.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 1. Changing polynomial is easy without introducing incompatibilities in cryptographic applications: we just change the base used for representation of the field elements before and after the bulk of the computation. In general the cost of one conversion is, as as for the conversion between normal and polynomial bases, about one field multiplication. Therefore this overhead is essentially negligible with respect to the full cost of a scalar multiplication, that is in the order of magnitude of hundreds to thousands of field multiplications (see for example &sect; 5.3 of [5]).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 2. The cost of a square root extraction implemented by using the sparse version of  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  offered by the above polynomials can be roughly estimated using, for example, already published results. For example in [19], Example 3.12, the NIST-recommended trinomial</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$P(X) = X^{233} + X^{74} + 1 (4)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">for the finite field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{233}}</span>  is used. Even though the term  <span class="math">X^{74}</span>  does not have an odd exponent,  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  has a sparse representation</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\zeta = (x^{32} + x^{117} + x^{191})(x^{37} + 1)</span>$
.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">By this, finding a root via equation (1) requires roughly 1/8 of the time of a field multiplication. As we shall show in the next section we can choose</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$P(X) = X^{233} + X^{159} + 1</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and in this case</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\zeta = x^{117} + x^{80}</span>$
.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The number of shift operations and XOR operations required to multiply by  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  is thus reduced. Furthermore, as already remarked, there is no need to perform a reduction modulo P(X) while with non-square root friendly polynomials this is always necessary, even with the polynomial (4). Implementation results show the cost of a square root to be less than 9% of that of a multiplication. See &sect; 3.4 for precise results.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 3. Similar formul&aelig; for cube root computations are found in [1] &ndash; their results are easily partially generalised to any odd characteristic.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 4. Type I SSRF polynomials enjoy another very useful property. In [2] it is proved: If  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^d}</span>  is defined by an irreducible polynomial P(X) whose non constant terms all have odd exponents, then the trace of a field element  <span class="math">\\alpha</span>  represented as  <span class="math">\\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} a_i x^i</span>  with respect to the polynomial basis induced by P(X) is its constant term  <span class="math">a_0</span> . In other words, the only traceone element in the polynomial basis defined by P(X) is 1. This is very important in the applications: for instance, as remarked in the Introduction, a trace computation is necessary to halve a point. It is especially fortunate that the same family of polynomials makes both square roots and trace computations faster. Type II SSRF polynomials do not enjoy this property, however they are not relevant for the applications, as we shall see at the beginning of Subsection 2.4. It is interesting to observe</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">that this type of polynomials was also investigated in [2], because all element of the polynomial basis, except at most for 1, have trace one, but the connection to the type I SSRF polynomials, due to the common minimality of degree of  <span class="math">\\sqrt{x}</span> , is new and surprising. The following theorem is (a slight extension of) Theorem 10 from [2]. For the reader's convenience, we provide also a proof (omitted in [2]).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 2.</strong> Let P(X) be be any irreducible polynomial of degree d over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2</span> , and x a zero of P(X) in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^d}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In what follows by the trace  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Tr}</span>  on  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^d}</span>  we shall always understand the trace from  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^d}</span>  to  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The trace spectrum of P(X) is the vector formed by the traces of the elements of the polynomial basis of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^d}/\\mathbb{F}_2</span>  associated to P(X), i.e.  <span class="math">[\\text{Tr}(1), \\text{Tr}(x), \\text{Tr}(x^2), \\dots, \\text{Tr}(x^{d-1})]</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 2 ([2, Theorem 10]).</strong> Let  <span class="math">P(X) = \\sum_{i=0}^{d} a_{d-i} X^i</span>  be an irreducible polynomial over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2</span>  of degree d (with  <span class="math">a_0 = a_d = 1</span> ) and let x be a zero of P(X) in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^d}</span> .</p>

      <h3 id="sec-2.3" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2.3 Square-Root Friendly Polynomials of Even Degree</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since, as already remarked, Theorem 2 holds also for even degree d, in this Subsection we shall consider the case where the degree d of the extension is even. Square roots can be computed in an entirely analogous way to the odd degree case by suitably defining  <span class="math">\\alpha_{\\text{even}}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\alpha_{\\text{odd}}</span> . In this case, the polynomials defining  <span class="math">\\alpha_{\\text{even}}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\alpha_{\\text{odd}}</span>  both have degree (d-2)/2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 3.</strong> Let  <span class="math">X^d + X^m + 1</span>  with d even, m odd and m &lt; d be an irreducible polynomial over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2</span> , and x a zero of P(X) in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^d} = \\mathbb{F}_2[X]/(P(X))</span> . Then</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\sqrt{x} = x^{\\frac{2d-m+1}{2}} + x^{\\frac{d-m+1}{2}} + x^{\\frac{m+1}{2}} . \\tag{7}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If m = d/2 (with m odd) note that  <span class="math">\\sqrt{x} = x^{\\frac{3}{4}d + \\frac{1}{2}}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The proof is a simple verification. In [2] it is proved that there are  <span class="math">\\lfloor (d-1)/(d-m) \\rfloor</span>  ones in the trace spectrum of  <span class="math">X^d + X^m + 1</span> . It is  <span class="math">\\text{Tr}(x^i) = 1</span>  for  <span class="math">0 \\le i &lt; d</span>  if and only if  <span class="math">(d-m) \\mid i</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In particular, if  <span class="math">m \\leq d/2</span>  there is exactly one trace one element, namely  <span class="math">x^{d-m}</span> . These trinomials, if they exist, are good for trace computation as well as square root extraction &ndash; even though in the last case modular reduction of the product  <span class="math">\\zeta \\cdot \\alpha_{\\rm odd}</span>  will be necessary, unless m=1, in which case  <span class="math">\\zeta=x^{d/2}+1</span> . Since trinomials do not exist for all extension degrees, we need to characterize generic polynomials with good properties. This is done in the next theorem.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 4.</strong> Let d be even, and let the field extension  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^d}/\\mathbb{F}_2</span>  be defined by P(X) an irreducible polynomial of degree d. Suppose that  <span class="math">\\zeta = \\sqrt{x} = \\mathcal{V}(x)</span>  where  <span class="math">\\mathcal{V}(X) \\in \\mathbb{F}_2[X]</span>  is a polynomial of degree d/2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Then  <span class="math">P(X) = \\mathcal{V}(X)^2 + X</span>  with  <span class="math">\\mathcal{V}</span>  of even weight and  <span class="math">\\mathcal{V}(0) = 1</span> . Furthermore, the only trace equal to 1 in the spectrum of P(X) is  <span class="math">\\text{Tr}(x^{d-1})</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof. If  <span class="math">\\sqrt{x} = \\mathcal{V}(x)</span>  with  <span class="math">\\mathcal{V}(X) \\in \\mathbb{F}_2[X]</span>  and  <span class="math">\\deg(\\mathcal{V}) = d/2</span> , then upon squaring the relation  <span class="math">\\sqrt{x} = \\mathcal{V}(x)</span>  we obtain  <span class="math">\\mathcal{V}(x)^2 + x = 0</span> . Since x is a root of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{V}(X)^2 + X</span>  and of the irreducible polynomial P(X) of the same degree, we see that  <span class="math">P(X) = \\mathcal{V}(X)^2 + X</span> . The other properties of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{V}</span>  are now immediate. The statement about the trace spectrum is a simple application of identity (6).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since  <span class="math">\\deg(\\mathcal{V}) = d/2</span>  we have that  <span class="math">\\zeta \\cdot \\alpha_{\\text{odd}}</span>  has degree d-1 and thus does not need to be reduced. The polynomials described in the last two theorems are this good for trace and square root computation. This prompts us to make the following definition.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 3.</strong> A special square root friendly trinomial of type III is an irreducible trinomial of form  <span class="math">X^d + X^m + 1</span>  with d even, m odd, and  <span class="math">m \\leq d/2</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A special square root friendly polynomial of type IV is an irreducible polynomial P(X) that can be written in the form  <span class="math">p(X) = \\mathcal{V}(X)^2 + X</span>  with  <span class="math">\\mathcal{V} \\in \\mathbb{F}_2[X]</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Even degree irreducible polynomials with only one odd degree exponent have been considered in [2]: The type IV SSRF polynomials are yet another example of polynomials investigated in the context of sparse trace spectra that re-appear when low degree square roots are considered.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">By allowing flexibility in the choice of the weight, we can safely conjecture that we can find polynomials of every even degree. There are trinomials, such as  <span class="math">X^{46}+X+1</span> , for which  <span class="math">\\sqrt{x}=x^{23}+1</span> , as well as pentanomials, like  <span class="math">X^{48}+X^{38}+X^4+X+1</span> , for which  <span class="math">\\sqrt{x}=x^{24}+x^{19}+x^2+1</span> , and heptanomials like  <span class="math">X^{206}+X^{104}+X^8+X^4+X^2+X+1</span>  with  <span class="math">\\sqrt{x}=x^{103}+x^{52}+x^4+x^2+x+1</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Increasing the degree of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{V}(X)</span>  even just by one is enough to obtain trace spectra that are no longer extremal, even though they still show an interesting periodicity.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 5.</strong> Let d be even, and let the field extension  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^d}/\\mathbb{F}_2</span>  be defined by P(X) an irreducible polynomial of degree d.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Therefore  <span class="math">X^2 + X + 1 \\mid \\mathcal{V}(X)^2 + X</span> , which implies that  <span class="math">X^2 + X + 1</span>  divides  <span class="math">\\mathcal{V}(X)^2 + X^2 + 1 = (\\mathcal{V}(X) + X + 1)^2</span> , and thus  <span class="math">\\mathcal{V}(X) + X + 1</span> .

      <h3 id="sec-2.4" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2.4 Existence and Degrees of the Terms</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With applications in sight, let us focus again on SSRF polynomial of odd degree. Such polynomials are easy to find. For example, for extension degree d=163, a simple Magma [16] script determined all 713 (special) type I SSRF pentanomials of degree 163 in less than one minute.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">But, there are no type II SSRF pentanomials of degree 163. The first (in lexycographic order) heptanomial of degree 163 is  <span class="math">X^{163} + X^{162} + X^{59} + X^{58} + X^3 + X^2 + 1</span>  However, Type II SSRF trinomials and pentanomials exist. For type II,  <span class="math">1 + X^{126} + X^{127}</span>  is a type II trinomial with  <span class="math">\\zeta = 1 + x^{63} + x^{64}</span> . For fields not defined by trinomials, we know only a few type II pentanomials. For degree 43, for example, we have  <span class="math">X^{43} + X^{42} + X^{29} + X^{28} + 1</span> , for which of course  <span class="math">\\zeta = x^{22} + x^{21} + x^{15} + x^{14} + 1</span> . For prime degrees under 500 for which no irreducible trinomial exists (but pentanomials exist), the only <em>prime</em> degrees for which type II SSRF pentanomials exist are: 13, 43, 59, 101, 109, 157, 173, 181, 269, 311, 397, 461, and 491.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The difficulty in finding type II SSRF polynomials is not a concern. For the applications, the most important SSRF polynomials are those of Type I, because in general they have reasonably low degree sediment (the sediment of an univariate is obtained by removing its leading term). A type II SSRF polynomial of degree d has form  <span class="math">X^d + X^{d-1} + \\ldots + 1</span>  and in general reduction modulo these polynomials is not efficient.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One way of finding good ones would be to try to find a type II SSRF polynomial P(X) of maximum weight, for which  <span class="math">(X + 1) \\cdot P(X)</span>  has low weight, and mimic the reduction procedures explained in [3]. Since pentanomials are in practice always found, this approach is only interesting if we find  <span class="math">(X + 1) \\cdot P(X)</span>  of weight four. If</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$P_{d,m}(X) = 1 + \\sum_{\\substack{1 \\le i \\le d-1 \\\\ i \\ne m}} X^{2i} + X^{2i+1}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">for any d and  <span class="math">\\leq m \\leq (d-3)/2</span> , we see that  <span class="math">(X+1) \\cdot P_{d,m}(X)</span>  has weight four only if m=1. Then  <span class="math">P_{d,1}(X)</span>  is irreducible and of prime degree for d=31, 97, 151, 577, 7879 and for no other degree below 10000. In the first four cases, irreducible trinomials exist, and degree 7879 requires a pentanomial.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Table 1 we list (Type I) SSRF polynomials of several degrees. The degrees have been taken from the NIST list of recommended binary curves and from the extension degrees used in [12]. All these extension degrees are interesting because they are either used in standards for elliptic curve cryptography or they represent good choices for extension degrees for defining hyperelliptic curve for cryptographic applications.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">When no trinomial is available, a pentanomial is listed. We always report the polynomial with least degree sediment. Only in a handful of cases is the SSRF polynomial with least degree sediment the same as the standard one, i.e. the irreducible polynomial with least degree sediment but without the restriction on being square root friendly.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We first note that if an irreducible trinomial of a given odd degree exists, then we can always find one which is square root friendly.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 6.</strong> Let d be an odd positive integer. If an irreducible trinomial  <span class="math">P(X) = X^d + X^m + 1</span>  over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2</span>  of degree d exists, then P(X) can be chosen of form (2), i.e. where the exponent m of the middle term is odd.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof. Let  <span class="math">X^d + X^m + 1</span>  be an irreducible trinomial with d &gt; m &gt; 0 and m even. Then it is easy to prove that the polynomial  <span class="math">X^d + X^{d-m} + 1</span>  is also irreducible &ndash; but d - m is odd. In fact, let q(X) be a monic polynomial over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2</span>  with q(X) = 1, i.e. non-vanishing constant term. Let  <span class="math">q^*(X) = X^{\\deg q}q(X^{-1})</span>  be the reciprocal polynomial of q(X). It is easy to see that  <span class="math">q^*</span>  is a monic polynomial with non-vanishing constant term. Then, a factorization q(X) = g(X)h(X) implies  <span class="math">q^*(X) = g^*(X)h^*(X)</span> . Applying this result to  <span class="math">q(X) = X^d + X^{d-m} + 1</span>  proves that it must be irreducible, otherwise  <span class="math">P(X) = q^*(X)</span>  would be also reducible.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 1. Some special square root friendly trinomials and pentanomials.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Existence results for pentanomial-defined fields are still an open question. However, on the basis of Table 1 and further experimental results, we found further evidence for an observation of Ahmadi and Menezes: In [2] they list irreducible pentanomials P(X) having only non-constant terms with odd exponent for which the sediment has lowest degree, and observe that if  <span class="math">d \\equiv \\pm 3 \\pmod{8}</span> , the degree of the sediment is at least d/3, whereas if  <span class="math">d \\equiv \\pm 1 \\pmod{8}</span> , then the degree of the sediment is usually quite small. In fact, if a trinomial exists for degree d, then a square-root friendly pentanomial with a sediment of degree much lower than d/3 usually also exists.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the extension degrees for which there are no trinomials we computed not only the SSRF pentanomials but also the <em>heptanomials</em> with smallest degree sediment &ndash; the idea was, that perhaps one can find good</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 2. Some special square root friendly heptanomials.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">heptanomials with a lower degree sediment than the best pentanomials, to improve modular reduction: they are given in Table 2. Similar searches for polynomials with nine and eleven terms have been performed. We immediately observe here that sediment degree differences are very limited, so the heptanomials do not bring advantages. The same observation applies to polynomials with nine or eleven terms. A pattern in the distribution of degrees of the second term of the sediment of SSRF polynomials up to degree 3000 and with up to eleven terms prompts us to formulate the following conjecture:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Conjecture 1. Let d be an odd positive integer, and c be the minimum of the degrees of the sediments of all square root friendly polynomials of degree d. Further, let c' be the minimum of the degrees of the second highest degree term of all the sediments of degree c of square root friendly polynomials of degree d. Then</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$3c - d = c - c&#x27; = \\begin{cases} 8 &amp; \\text{if } d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\\\ 4 &amp; \\text{if } d \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\end{cases}</span>$
.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A first result in this direction has already been proved by Bluher [15] using a result of Swan [28] (that in fact goes back to Stickelberger). Her result is: The odd degree polynomial  <span class="math">P(X) = X^d + \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{S}} X^i + 1</span>  in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2[X]</span> ,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">S \\subset \\{i : i \\text{ odd}, 0 &lt; i &lt; d/3\\} \\cup \\{i : i \\equiv d \\pmod{4}, 0 &lt; i &lt; d\\}</span> has no repeated roots; if  <span class="math">d = \\pm 1 \\pmod{8}</span> , then f has an odd number of irreducible factors; and if  <span class="math">d = \\pm 3 \\pmod{8}</span> , then f has an even number of irreducible factors. In fact, by adapting the proof given in [3] of Bluher's result, it is possible to prove the following theorem:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 7.</strong> Let d be an odd positive integer and the polynomial  <span class="math">P(X) \\in \\mathbb{F}_2[x]</span>  have degree d and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>If
<span class="math">$d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}</span>$
, then  <span class="math">P(X)</span>  is either of the form
<span class="math">$-X^{d} + X^{\\frac{d+8}{3}} + \\sum_{j \\in J} X^{j} + 1 \\text{ where } J = \\left\\{j : j \\text{ odd, } 1 \\leq j &lt; \\frac{d-19}{3}\\right\\}</span>$</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$- \\text{ or } X^{d} + \\sum_{j \\in J&#x27;} X^{j} + 1 \\text{ where } J&#x27; = \\left\\{j : j \\text{ odd, } 1 \\leq j \\leq \\frac{d+5}{3}\\right\\};</span>$
2. If  <span class="math">d \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}</span> , then  <span class="math">P(X)</span>  is either of the form
<span class="math">$-X^{d} + X^{\\frac{d+4}{3}} + \\sum_{j \\in J} X^{j} + 1 \\text{ where } J = \\left\\{j : j \\text{ odd, } 1 \\leq j \\leq \\frac{d-11}{3}\\right\\}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Then P(X) is square-free. Furthermore, if  <span class="math">d \\equiv \\pm 1 \\mod 8</span>  then P(X) has an odd number of irreducible factors, whereas  <span class="math">d \\equiv \\pm 3 \\mod 8</span>  then P(X) has an even number of irreducible factors and therefore must be reducible.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 5. We already mentioned in Remark 4 that in [2] the polynomials we study are proven to permit efficient computation of traces. In Conjecture 9 of [2] it is also speculated that if an irreducible pentanomial of degree d exists, then an irreducible pentanomial of the same degree defining a polynomial basis with only one trace-one element also exists. In the similar vein we could try to restrict our Conjecture 1 to pentanomials, but we have the following example for degree 1987:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$X^{1987} + X^{665} + X^{661} + X^{549} + 1</span>$
.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This polynomial has minimal degree sediment, and the sediment has minimal degree second term among all irreducible pentanomials with minimal degree sediment. We have  <span class="math">d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}</span>  and 3c - d = 8, but the second term of the sediment has degree 661, not 657. On the other hand, with heptanomials we find following irreducible</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$X^{1987} + X^{665} + X^{657} + X^{25} + X^{21} + X^{9} + 1</span>$
.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and we know of no other irreducibles of the form</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$X^{1987} + X^c + X^{c&#x27;} + other lower odd degree terms + 1</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">with c smaller than 665 or with c = 665 and c' smaller than 657.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For several binary fields F<sup>2</sup> <sup>d</sup> we implemented a few operations, including (but not only) multiplication, squaring, square roots, and also trace and half-trace computations (the latter is used for solving quadratic equations). For multiplication and squaring we implemented generic routines as well as routines that have been optimized for each degree, by (partially) unrolling all loops and avoiding superfluous operations, especially those involving most significant bits of operands that are known to be zero. For example, the routines for 83 and 89 bit fields, as well as those for 193 and 191 bit fields are different and have different performance, despite the fact that in the first two examples the inputs all fit in 3 words of 32 bits, and in the second they all fit in 6 words. Our implementation was written in the C programming language, the compiler used was gcc version 4.0.1. In fact the new routines are an extension of the library described in [8] (some performance discrepances are due to the fact that some other routines have been improved in the meantime) and as such in the current version processes the operands with a 32-bit granularity.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Depending on the nature of the chosen reduction polynomial we implemented some routines such as modular reduction and square root extraction in different ways. In a few cases we implement the same field twice using two different reduction polynomials in order to compare the different situations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To implement square root extraction of a field element &alpha; we use formula (1): the only part that changes between different implementations is how the multiplication &zeta; &middot;&alpha;odd is realized. Furthermore, among the square root friendly polynomials we only consider the SSRF polynomials of type I.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To compute &alpha;even and &alpha;odd from &alpha; we use a 16-bit to 8-bit lookup table to compress the bits. Using a trick due to Robert Harley, this table is stored in 256 consecutive bytes by compressing the input i as (i + i &gt;&gt; 7) &amp; 0xff.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If the reduction polynomial P(X) is not SSRF of type I, then the Hamming weight of the square root is counted at the time of initialization of the library - hence only once. If this weight is low enough then a simple routine that XORs together shifted copies of &alpha;odd according to which bits in &zeta; are set is used. If the weight is higher than a certain threshold, then a comb binary polynomial multiplication method is used, where the precomputations relative to  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  are performed only once, at initialization time. A reduction modulo P(X) is then performed, if necessary.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">By means of this we can always keep the time of the multiplication  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  &middot;  <span class="math">\\alpha_{\\rm odd}</span>  to just under a half of the time of a <em>generic</em> field multiplication: Note, however, that this time can be substantially higher than the time required for the per-field, ad-hoc optimized implementation of multiplication, as our experimental results in &sect; 3.4 show.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the case where the degree d reduction polynomial P(X) is square root friendly, we also have a simple routine that XORs together shifted copies of  <span class="math">\\alpha_{\\text{odd}}</span>  according to which bits in  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  are set, but since the weight is very low and known, the routine can be unrolled completely. Furthermore, as already mentioned, in this case no modular reduction is necessary. This routine is the one that delivers the best performance.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-3.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.2 Trace Computation</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We follow here [19] and [2]. For generic binary fields, to compute the trace we use the fact that it is linear. In other words, once we have computed the trace spectrum, to determined the trace of an element  <span class="math">\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{F}_{2^d}</span> ,  <span class="math">\\alpha = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} a_i x^i</span>  where the  <span class="math">a_i \\in \\mathbb{F}_2</span> , we compute</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\operatorname{Tr}(\\alpha) = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} a_i \\operatorname{Tr}(x^i) .</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The latter sum can be implemented by a componentwise multiplication (hence, a logical AND operation) of the bit vector representing the element  <span class="math">\\alpha</span>  with a bit vector whose <em>i</em>-th component (starting with the zeroth component!) is the trace of  <span class="math">x^i</span> , called the <em>trace vector</em>, followed by a bit count modulo 2. Both operations can be performed very efficiently. The trace vector is of course computed once for each field.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, when a square root friendly polynomial is used to represent the field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_d</span>  with d odd, the trace vector contains just one bit set, namely the least significant bit, and  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Tr}(\\alpha) = a_0</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We therefore implemented two different routines: the first one uses a trace vector and the second one just polls the value of a single bit.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-3.3" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.3 Solving Quadratic Equations (Half-Traces)</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In order to solve quadratic equations of the form</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\lambda^2 + \\lambda = \\alpha \\tag{10}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">for  <span class="math">\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{F}_{2^d}</span>  where  <span class="math">\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{F}_{2^d}</span>  we implement just one generic routine, that takes the element c as an input as well as a precomputed table.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The half-trace operator on  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^d}</span>  (d odd) is defined as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$H(\\alpha) = \\sum_{i=0}^{(d-1)/2} \\alpha^{2^{2i}}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and it is easily verified that it is  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2</span> -linear, and that  <span class="math">H(\\alpha)</span>  satisfies  <span class="math">H(\\alpha)^2 + H(\\alpha) = \\alpha + \\text{Tr}(\\alpha)</span> . Therefore, in order to solve equation (10) we first have to check whether  <span class="math">\\text{Tr}(\\alpha) = 0</span> . Only in that case (10) is solvable: Then we compute the half-trace  <span class="math">H(\\alpha)</span>  of  <span class="math">\\alpha</span>  and  <span class="math">H(\\alpha)</span> ,  <span class="math">H(\\alpha) + 1</span>  are the solutions.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One optimization consists in removing the coefficients of even powers of x as detailed in [19]: We write  <span class="math">H(\\alpha) = H(\\alpha&#x27;) + \\beta</span>  where  <span class="math">\\alpha&#x27;</span>  has fewer nonzero coefficients than  <span class="math">\\alpha</span> . This can be done by observing that  <span class="math">H(x^{2i}) = H(x^i) + x^{2i} + \\text{Tr}(x^{2i})</span> . We can thus reduce the amount of stored half-traces of powers of x by half.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our approach differs from the one in [19] in that we do not make ad-hoc attempts to minimize memory requirements. Instead, we reduce the number of half-traces to be accumulated by increasing the amount of precomputations. We compute and store  <span class="math">H(\\ell_0 x^{8i+1} + \\ell_1 x^{8i+3} + \\ell_2 x^{8i+5} + \\ell_3 x^{8i+7})</span>  for all  <span class="math">i \\geq 0</span>  such that  <span class="math">8i+1 \\leq d-2</span>  and all  <span class="math">(\\ell_0, \\ell_1, \\ell_2, \\ell_3) \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^4 \\setminus \\{(0,0,0,0)\\}</span>  such that the degree of the argument of H is at most d-2. By means of this we reduce by a factor 32/15 the expected number of table lookups and additions of half-traces.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-3.4" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.4 Results, Conclusions</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We benchmarked our implementation. Table 3 collects the timings of our routines on a PowerPC G4 running at 1.5 Ghz. (Table 4 shows the timings of the same 32-bit code on on an Intel Core 2 Duo CPU running at 1.83 Ghz.) Several field operations are timed, and the costs relative to a field multiplication are provided. The reduction polynomials are given as well as if they are square root friendly or not.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We have chosen degrees in various more or less evenly spaced ranges to fulfil the following requirements: the &quot;classical&quot; extension degrees 163, 191, and 233 must be included, fields around integer submultiples of these sizes should also be taken into account (that's the reason for degrees in the ranges 40-50 and 80-100, and 127), and we should provide examples of fields where the &quot;standard&quot; polynomial (either in the sense that it comes from standard documents, or that it is the most common one used for</p>

Furthermore, all these combination of cases should happen with trinomial defined fields as well as when pentanomials are used. The &quot;submultiples&quot; ranges are relevant because of Trace Zero Varieties coming from elliptic curves [17, 6], and future investigation will consider the use of point and divisor halving for these algebraic groups.</p>

      <li>The claims made in [19] about the speed of optimized square root extraction for fields defined by suitable trinomials are extended to pentanomials. Our results show for fields of 163, 191, and 233 bits an even further reduced Sqrt/Mul ratio. The gain with respect to generic implementations of square roots ranges from 8 to 20, and it is higher for smaller fields (a recurring theme, cf. [8]).</li>

      <li>Multiplication and squaring may get marginally slower because the SSRF polynomials usually do not have minimal degree sediments, and thus the reduction routine is more complex. The differences are minimal, field squaring paying a slightly higher toll than field multiplication. &ndash; the reason is the higher relative increase of complexity for a simple routine such as squaring, which in turn causes, for instance, less efficient register coloring in the C compiler.

    <p class="text-gray-300">crease in the reduction routine is relatively small, see for instance Appendix B &ndash; in particular with respect to the number of machine operations required to perform a multiplication.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Sometimes a small performance improvement (presumably due to randomness) is observed. Field inversion and half-trace computation are unaffected by the choice of polynomial.</p>

      <li><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>In [19] computing an half-trace requires approximately 2/3 the time of a field multiplication, but for fields of the same sizes our ratios are often lower than 1/2, because we use a lot of precomputations.</li>
    </ol></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Table 5 we give estimates of the costs relative to one field multiplication of elliptic curve group addition, doubling, halving and scalar multiplication using various algorithms. We have used the operations counts from [5, &sect; 5.2], but the ratios between field operations come from our Table 3 for the Power PC G4. We can see that the use of type I SSRF polynomials has a noticeable impact on scalar multiplication performance based on point halving. Point halving alone is sped up by about 20%, and the whole scalar multiplication by about 14% for curves defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{163}}</span>  and by 11% if the base field is  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{233}}</span> . These improvements are much larger that the difference in field multiplication performance (a 2.5 &permil; loss for  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{163}}</span> , a 4.5 &permil; gain for  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{233}}</span> ). Similar improvements can be achieved on the Yao-like scalar multiplication algorithms from [5].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 5. Costs of elliptic curve group operations and scalar multiplication relative to those of a field multiplication. Add, resp. Dbl, Hlv mean Addition, resp. Doubling, Halving, and D &amp; A, resp. H &amp; A means windowed scalar multiplication based on Double-and-Add, resp. Halve-and-Add. Scalar multiplications methods use affine coordinates as well as mixed affine-Lopez-Dahab coordinates.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Square root friendly polynomials should be used when implementing formul&aelig; that make heavy use of square root extraction in fields of characteristic two. For solving quadratic equations then we advise to increase the amount of precomputed half-traces to improve performance. In particular, the improvements in scalar multiplication performance based on point halving obtained in [19] by using special trinomial can be carried over to fields defined by pentanomials. Around 20% can be expected for the point halving alone, with an impact of 11% to 14% on the entire scalar multiplication.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">B Comparing some modular reduction routines</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The use of a square root friendly polynomial can slow down modular reduction, but we already observed that this performance loss is minimal. This is explained by the fact that even though reduction does become more expensive, the amount of additional operations is rather small.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As an example, we report here the reduction code for the two degree 163 polynomials which we used. The input is given as eleven 32-bit words rA,r9,r8,...,r1,r0 and the reduced output is computed in place in the six least significant words r5,r4,r3,r2,r1,r0.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To reduce modulo  <span class="math">X^{163} + X^7 + X^6 + X^3 + 1</span> , the number of necessary logical operations between CPU registers is 74. Reduction modulo  <span class="math">X^{163} + X^{57} + X^{49} + X^{29} + 1</span>  takes 89 logical operations.</p>

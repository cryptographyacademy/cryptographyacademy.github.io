      <p class="text-gray-300">Abstract. In 2007, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology announced a call for the design of a new cryptographic hash algorithm in response to vulnerabilities identified in existing hash functions, such as MD5 and SHA-1. NIST received many submissions, 51 of which got accepted to the first round. At present, 14 candidates are left in the second round. An important criterion in the selection process is the SHA-3 hash function security and more concretely, the possible security reductions of the hash function to the security of its underlying building blocks. While some of the candidates are supported with firm security reductions, for most of the schemes these results are still incomplete. In this paper, we compare the state of the art provable security reductions of the second round candidates. We discuss all SHA-3 candidates at a high functional level, and analyze and summarize the security reduction results. Surprisingly, we derive some security bounds from the literature, which the hash function designers seem to be unaware of. Additionally, we generalize the well-known proof of collision resistance preservation, such that all SHA-3 candidates with a suffix-free padding are covered.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Hash functions are a building block for numerous cryptographic applications. In 2004 a series of attacks by Wang et al. [\[66,](#page-14-0)[67\]](#page-14-1) have exposed security vulnerabilities in the design of the most widely adopted and deployed SHA-1 hash function. As a result, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) recommended the replacement of SHA-1 by the SHA-2 hash function family and announced a call for the design of a new SHA-3 hashing algorithm. The SHA-3 hash function must allow for message digests of length 224, 256, 384 and 512 bits, it should be efficient, and most importantly it should provide an adequate level of security. In the current second round, 14 candidate hash functions are still in the race for the selection of the SHA-3 hash function. These candidates are under active evaluation by the cryptographic community. As a result of the performed comparative analysis, several classifications of the SHA-3 candidates, mostly focussed on hardware performance, appeared in the literature [\[33,](#page-13-0)[64,](#page-14-2)[32,](#page-13-1)[45\]](#page-14-3). A classification based on the specified by NIST security criteria is however still due.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">NIST Security Requirements. NIST specifies a number of security requirements [\[55\]](#page-14-4) to be satisfied by the future SHA-3 function: (i) at least one variant of the hash function must securely support HMAC and randomized hashing. Furthermore, for all n-bit digest values, the hash function must provide (ii) preimage resistance of approximately n bits, (iii) second preimage resistance of approximately n − L bits, where the first preimage is of length at most 2<sup>L</sup> blocks, (iv) collision resistance of approximately n/2 bits, and (v) all variants must be resistant to the length-extension attack. Finally, (vi) for any m ≤ n, the hash function specified by taking a fixed subset of m bits of the function's output is required to satisfy properties (ii)-(v) with n replaced by m.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Our Contribution. In this work we provide a survey of the 14 remaining SHA-3 candidates, in which we compare their security reductions. More concretely, we consider preimage, second preimage and collision resistance (security requirements (ii)-(iv)) for the n = 256 and n = 512 variants. Most of our security analysis is realized in the ideal model, where one or more of the underlying integral building blocks (e.g., the underlying block cipher or permutation(s)) are assumed to be ideal, i.e. random primitives. Additionally, to argue collision resistance we extend the standard proof of Merkle-Damgård collision resistance [27,53] to cover <em>all</em> SHA-3 candidate hash functions with a suffix-free padding (App. A). Notice that the basic Merkle-Damgård proof does not suffice in the presence of a final transformation and/or a chopping.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Furthermore, we consider the indifferentiability of the candidates. Informally, indifferentiability guarantees that a design has no structural design flaws [26], and in particular (as formally proven in App. B) an indifferentiability result provides upper bounds on the advantage of finding preimages, second preimages and collisions.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Our main contribution consists in performing a comparative survey of the existing security results on the 14 hash function candidates and results derivable from earlier works on hash functions, and suggesting possible research directions aimed at resolving some of the identified open problems. Section 2 briefly covers the notation, and the basic principles of hash function design. In Sect. 3, we consider all candidates from a provable security point of view. We give a high level algorithmic description of each hash function, and discuss the existing security results. All results are summarized in Table 1. We conclude the paper with Sect. 4 and give some final remarks on the security comparison.</p>
      <h4 id="span-id-page-1-0-span-2-preliminaries" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2"><span id="page-1-0"></span>2 Preliminaries</h4>
      <p class="text-gray-300">For a positive integer value  <span class="math">n \in \mathbb&#123;N&#125;</span> , we denote by  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;Z&#125;_2^n</span>  the set of bit strings of length n, and by  <span class="math">(\mathbb&#123;Z&#125;_2^n)^<em></span>  the set of strings of length a positive multiple of n bits. We denote by  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;Z&#125;_2^</em></span>  the set of bit strings of arbitrary length. If x, y are two bit strings, their concatenation is denoted by x||y. By |x| we denote the length of a bit string x, and for  <span class="math">m, n \in \mathbb&#123;N&#125;</span>  we denote by  <span class="math">\langle m \rangle_n</span>  the encoding of m as an n-bit string. The function  <span class="math">\mathsf&#123;chop&#125;_n(x)</span>  chops off n bits of a bit string x.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Throughout, we use a unified notation for all candidates. The value n denotes the output size of the hash function, l the size of the chaining value, and m the number of message bits compressed in one iteration of the compression function. A padded message is always parsed as a sequence of  <span class="math">k \geq 1</span>  message blocks of length m bits:  <span class="math">(M_1, \ldots, M_k)</span> .</p>
      <h4 id="2-1-security-notions" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2.1 Security Notions</h4>
      <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we investigate the security of the hash functions in the 'ideal model' and the more classical 'generic' security.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Security in the ideal model. In the ideal model, a compressing function F (either on fixed or arbitrary input lengths) that uses one or more underlying building blocks is viewed insecure if there exists a successful information-theoretic adversary that has only query access to the idealized underlying primitives of F. The complexity of the attack is measured by the number of queries q to the primitive made by the adversary. In this work it is clear from the context which of the underlying primitives is assumed to be ideal. The three main security properties required from the SHA-3 hash function are preimage, second preimage and collision resistance. For each of these three notions, with  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;_F^&#123;\mathrm&#123;atk&#125;&#125;</span> , where  <span class="math">\mathrm&#123;atk&#125; \in \&#123;\mathrm&#123;pre&#125;, \mathrm&#123;sec&#125;, \mathrm&#123;col&#125;\&#125;</span> , we denote the maximum advantage of an adversary to break the function F under the security notion atk. The advantage is the probability function taken over all random choices of the underlying primitives, and the maximum is taken over all adversaries that make at most q queries to their oracles.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Additionally, we consider the indifferentiability of the SHA-3 candidates. The indifferentiability</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">framework introduced by Maurer et al. [52] is an extension of the classical notion of indistinguishability, and ensures that a hash function has no structural defects. We denote the indifferentiability security of a hash function  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;H&#125;</span>  by  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;^&#123;\mathrm&#123;pro&#125;&#125;_&#123;\mathcal&#123;H&#125;&#125;</span> , maximized over all distinguishers making at most q queries of maximal length  <span class="math">K \geq 0</span>  message blocks to their oracles. We refer to [26] for a formal definition. An indifferentiability bound guarantees security of the hash function against specific attacks. In particular, one can obtain a bound on  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;^&#123;\mathrm&#123;atk&#125;&#125;_&#123;\mathcal&#123;H&#125;&#125;</span> , for any security notion atk:  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;^&#123;\mathrm&#123;atk&#125;&#125;_&#123;\mathcal&#123;H&#125;&#125; \leq \mathbf&#123;Pr&#125;^&#123;\mathrm&#123;atk&#125;&#125;_&#123;RO&#125; + \mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;^&#123;\mathrm&#123;pro&#125;&#125;_&#123;\mathcal&#123;H&#125;&#125;</span> , where  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;Pr&#125;^&#123;\mathrm&#123;atk&#125;&#125;_&#123;RO&#125;</span>  denotes the success probability of a generic attack against  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;H&#125;</span>  under atk. This bound is proven in Thm. 2 (App. B).</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Generic security. The generic collision resistance security in the context of this work deals with analyzing the collision resistance of hash functions in the standard model. A hash function  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;H&#125;</span>  is called generically  <span class="math">(t, \varepsilon)</span>  collision resistant if no adversary running in time at most t can find two different messages M, M' such that  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;H&#125;(M) = \mathcal&#123;H&#125;(M')</span>  with advantage more than  <span class="math">\varepsilon</span> . We denote by  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;^&#123;\mathrm&#123;gcol&#125;&#125;_&#123;\mathcal&#123;H&#125;&#125;</span>  the generic collision resistance security of the function  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;H&#125;</span> , maximized over all 'efficient' adversaries. We refer the reader to [59,58,3] for a more formal discussion.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">To argue generic collision resistance security of the hash function  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;H&#125;</span>  (as domain extenders of fixed input length compression functions) we use the composition result of [27,53] and extend it to a wider class of suffix-free hash functions (App. A). This result concludes the collision resistance of the hash function  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;H&#125;</span>  assuming collision resistance security guarantees from the underlying compression functions. We then translate ideal model collision resistance security results on the compression functions via the latter composition to ideal model collision results on the hash function (expressed by  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;^&#123;\mathrm&#123;col&#125;&#125;_&#123;\mathcal&#123;H&#125;&#125;</span> ). A generic collision result, generally speaking, applies to a wider class of schemes for which no bounds on the collision resistance security of the underlying compression functions is known, e.g. for BLAKE and BMW.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">If a compressing function F outputs a bit string of length n, one expects to find collisions with high probability after approximately  <span class="math">2^&#123;n/2&#125;</span>  queries (due to the birthday attack). Similarly, (second) preimages can be found with high probability after approximately  <span class="math">2^n</span>  queries<sup>1</sup>. Moreover, finding second preimages is provably harder than finding collisions, and similar for preimages (depending on the specification of F) [59]. Formally, we have  <span class="math">\Omega(q^2/2^n) = \mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;_F^&#123;\mathrm&#123;col&#125;&#125; = O(1)</span> ,  <span class="math">\Omega(q/2^n) = \mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;_F^&#123;\mathrm&#123;sec&#125;&#125; \leq \mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;_F^&#123;\mathrm&#123;col&#125;&#125;</span> , and  <span class="math">\Omega(q/2^n) = \mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;_F^&#123;\mathrm&#123;pre&#125;&#125; \leq \mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;_F^&#123;\mathrm&#123;col&#125;&#125; + \varepsilon</span> , where  <span class="math">\varepsilon</span>  is negligible if F is a variable input length compressing function. In the remainder, we will consider these bounds for granted, and only include security results that improve either of these bounds. A bound is called tight if the lower and upper bound are the same up to a constant factor, and optimal if the bound is tight with respect to the original lower bound.</p>
      <h4 id="2-2-compression-function-design-strategies" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2.2 Compression Function Design Strategies</h4>
      <p class="text-gray-300">A common way to build compression functions is to base it on a block cipher [57,21,62], or on a (limited number of) permutation(s) [20,60,61]. Preneel et al. [57] analyzed and categorized 64 block cipher based compression functions. Twelve of them are formally proven secure by Black et al. [21]. These results have been recently generalized by Stam [62]. Interestingly, the latter result implies security bounds for some compression functions that do not fit in the PGV-model, like ECHO, Hamsi and SIMD. Throughout, by 'PGVx' we denote the  <span class="math">x^&#123;th&#125;</span>  type compression function</p>
      <span id="page-2-0"></span><sup>&</sup>lt;sup&gt;1</sup> Kelsey and Schneier [42] describe a second preimage attack on the Merkle-Damgård hash function that requires at most approximately  $2^&#123;n-L&#125;$  queries, where the first preimage is of length at most  $2^L$  blocks. This attack does, however, not apply to all SHA-3 candidates. In particular, the wide-pipe SHA-3 candidates remain mostly unaffected due to their increased internal state.
      <p class="text-gray-300">of [\[57\]](#page-14-9). We note that PGV1, PGV3 and PGV5 are better known as the Matyas-Meyer-Oseas, the Miyaguchi-Preneel and the Davies-Meyer compression functions, respectively.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">In the context of permutation based compression functions, Black et al. [\[20\]](#page-13-6) analyzed 2l- to l-bit compression functions based on one l-bit permutation, and proved them insecure. This result has been generalized by Rogaway and Steinberger [\[60\]](#page-14-11), Stam [\[61\]](#page-14-12) and Steinberger [\[63\]](#page-14-14) to compression functions with arbitrary input and output sizes, and an arbitrary number of underlying permutations. Their bounds indicate the number of queries required to find collisions or preimages for permutation based compression functions.</p>
      <h3 id="2-3-hash-function-design-strategies" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">2.3 Hash Function Design Strategies</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-300">In order to allow the hashing of arbitrarily long strings, all SHA-3 candidates employ a specific mode of operation. Central to all designs is the iterated hash function principle [\[47\]](#page-14-15): on input of an initialization vector IV, the iterated hash function H<sup>f</sup> based on the compression function f proceeds a padded message (M1, . . . , Mk) as follows:</p>
      <div class="math-block">\mathcal&#123;H&#125;^f(\mathsf&#123;IV&#125;; M_1, \dots, M_k) = h_k</div>
      <p class="text-gray-300">, where:  <span class="math">h_0 = \mathsf&#123;IV&#125;</span> ,</p>
      <div class="math-block">h_i = f(h_&#123;i-1&#125;, M_i) \text&#123; for &#125; i = 1, \dots, k.</div>
      <p class="text-gray-300">This principle is also called the plain Merkle-Damg˚ard (MD) design [\[53,](#page-14-5)[27\]](#page-13-2). Each of the 14 remaining candidates is based on this design, possibly followed by a final transformation (FT), and/or a chop-function[2](#page-3-0) .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The padding function pad : Z ∗ <sup>2</sup> → (Z m 2 ) ∗ is an injective mapping that transforms a message of arbitrary length to a message of length a multiple of m bits (the number of message bits compressed in one compression function iteration). Most of the candidates employ a sufficiently strong padding rule (cf. App. [C\)](#page-16-2). Additionally, in some of the designs the message blocks are compressed along with specific counters or tweaks, which may strengthen the padding rule. We distinguish between 'prefix-free' and/or 'suffix-free' padding.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">A padding rule is called suffix-free, if for any distinct M, M<sup>0</sup> , there exists no bit string X such that pad(M<sup>0</sup> ) = Xkpad(M). The plain MD design with any suffix-free padding (also called MD-strengthening [\[47\]](#page-14-15)) preserves collision resistance [\[53,](#page-14-5)[27\]](#page-13-2). We generalize this result in Thm. [1](#page-15-1) (App. [A\)](#page-15-0): informally, this preservation result also holds if the iteration is finalized by a distinct compression function and/or the chop-function. Other security properties, like preimage resistance, are however not preserved in the MD design [\[3\]](#page-13-4). It is also proven that the MD design with a suffix-free padding need not necessarily be indifferentiable [\[26\]](#page-13-3). However, the MD construction is indifferentiable if it ends with a chopping function or a final transformation, both when the underlying compression function is ideal or when the hash function is based on a PGV compression function [\[26,](#page-13-3)[39,](#page-14-16)[51\]](#page-14-17).</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">A padding rule is called prefix-free, if for any distinct M, M<sup>0</sup> , there exists no bit string X such that pad(M<sup>0</sup> ) = pad(M)kX. It has been proved that the MD design, based on ideal compression function or ideal PGV construction, with prefix-free padding is indifferentiable from a random oracle [\[25](#page-13-7)[,26](#page-13-3)[,39](#page-14-16)[,51\]](#page-14-17). Security notions like collision-resistance, are however not preserved in the MD design with prefix-free only padding.</p>
      <span id="page-3-0"></span><sup>2</sup> A function g is a final transformation if it differs from f, and is applied to the final state, possibly with the injection of an additional message block. The chop-function is not considered to be (a part of) a final transformation.
      <p class="text-gray-300">HAIFA design. A concrete design based on the MD principle is the HAIFA construction [\[18\]](#page-13-8). In HAIFA the message is padded in a specific way so as to solve some deficiencies of the original MD construction: in the iteration, each message block is accompanied with a fixed (optional) salt of s bits and a (mandatory) counter C<sup>i</sup> of t bits. The counter C<sup>i</sup> keeps track of the number of message bits hashed so far, and equals 0 by definition if the i th block does not contain any message bits. Partially due to the properties of this counter, the HAIFA padding rule is suffix- and prefix-free. As a consequence, the construction preserves collision resistance (cf. Thm. [1\)](#page-15-1) and the indifferentiability results of [\[26\]](#page-13-3) carry over. For the HAIFA design, these indifferentiability results are improved in [\[16\]](#page-13-9). Furthermore, the HAIFA construction is proven secure against second preimage attacks if the underlying compression function is assumed to behave like an ideal primitive [\[23\]](#page-13-10).</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Wide-pipe design. In the wide-pipe design [\[50\]](#page-14-18), the iterated state size is significantly larger than the final hash output: at the end of the iteration, a fraction of the output of a construction is discarded. As proved in [\[26\]](#page-13-3), the MD construction with a distinct final transformation and/or chopping at the end is indifferentiable from a random oracle.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Sponge functions. We do not explicitly consider sponge functions [\[15\]](#page-13-11) or their generalization [\[1\]](#page-11-0) as a specific type of construction: all SHA-3 candidates known to be sponge(-like) functions, CubeHash, Fugue, JH, Keccak and Luffa, can be described in terms of the chop-MD construction (possibly with a final transformation before or instead of the chopping).</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we analyze the security of the 14 remaining SHA-3 candidates in more detail. For simplicity, we only consider the proposals of the SHA-3 candidates that output digests of 256 or 512 bits. Observe that in many candidate SHA-3 hash function families, the algorithms that output 224 or 384 bits are the same as the 256- or 512-bits algorithms, except for an additional chopping at the end. Particularly, the results of [\[26\]](#page-13-3) and Thm. [1](#page-15-1) carry over in most of the cases. The same remark applies to requirement (vi) of NIST.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Requirement (i). All designers claim that their proposal can safely be used in HMAC mode [\[9\]](#page-13-12) or for randomized hashing [\[41\]](#page-14-19), and we do not discuss it here;</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Requirements (ii)-(iv). Preimage, second preimage and collision resistance of each hash function are discussed in this section. Additionally, we consider the indifferentiability of the candidates;</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Requirement (v). All hash function candidates are secure against the length extension attack, and thus we do not discuss it further.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Below, we examine the SHA-3 candidate hash functions in more detail. Each paragraph contains an informal discussion for each of the second round SHA-3 candidates and their security reduction results. The mathematical descriptions of the (abstracted) designs are given in Fig. [1,](#page-5-0) and the candidates' padding functions are summarized in App. [C.](#page-16-2) The concrete security results for all current candidate hash functions are summarized in Table [1.](#page-12-0) More precisely, for each candidate and each security notion, this table includes the security bound, as far as it exists, and the underlying assumption.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">3.1. The BLAKE hash function [\[6\]](#page-13-13) is a HAIFA construction. The message blocks are accompanied with a HAIFA-counter, and more generally, the function employs a suffix- and prefix-free padding rule. The compression function f is block cipher based[3](#page-4-1) . It moreover employs an injective linear</p>
      <span id="page-4-1"></span><sup>3</sup> As observed in [\[6,](#page-13-13) Sect. 5], the core part of the compression function can be seen as a permutation keyed by the message, which we view here as a block cipher.

      <span id="page-5-0"></span>**Fig. 1.** The padding rules employed by the functions are summarized in App. C. In all algorithm descriptions, IV denotes an initialization vector, h denotes state values, M denotes message blocks, S denotes a (fixed) salt, C denotes a counter and T denotes a tweak. The functions  $L, L', \mathsf&#123;Exp&#125;$  underlying BLAKE, BMW, ECHO, Fugue, Hamsi and Luffa, are explained in the corresponding section.
      <p class="text-gray-300">function L, and a linear function L' that XORs the first and second halves of the input.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Security of BLAKE. The compression function of BLAKE shows similarities with the PGV5 compression function [21], but no security results are known for this variation. The mode of operation of BLAKE is based on the HAIFA structure, and as a consequence all security properties regarding this type hold [18]. In particular, the design preserves collision resistance, and as a consequence we obtain  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;_&#123;\mathcal&#123;H&#125;&#125;^&#123;\mathrm&#123;col&#125;&#125; = \Theta(q^2/2^n)</span>  (if f is assumed ideal). Also, the design is secure against second preimage attacks. Additionally, a preimage for BLAKE implies a preimage for its last compression function, and we obtain  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;_&#123;\mathcal&#123;H&#125;&#125;^&#123;\mathrm&#123;pre&#125;&#125; = \Theta(q/2^n)</span> . Furthermore, the BLAKE hash function is indifferentiable from a random oracle if the underlying compression function is assumed to be ideal, due to the HAIFA counter [26,16].</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>3.2.</strong> The <strong>Blue Midnight Wish</strong> (BMW) hash function [38] is a chop-MD construction, with a final transformation before chopping. The hash function employs a suffix-free padding rule. The compression function f is block cipher based<sup>4</sup>, and the final transformation g consists of the same compression function with the chaining value processed as a message, and with an initial value as chaining input. The compression function employs a function L which consists of two compression functions with specific properties as specified in [38].</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Security of BMW. The compression function of BMW shows similarities with the PGV3 compression function [21], but no security results are known for this variation. Thm. 1 applies to BMW, where the final transformation has no message block as input, and as a consequence we obtain  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;_&#123;\mathcal&#123;H&#125;&#125;^&#123;\mathrm&#123;col&#125;&#125; = \Theta(q^2/2^n)</span>  (if f is assumed ideal). Additionally, a preimage for BMW implies a preimage for its final transformation, and we obtain  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;_&#123;\mathcal&#123;H&#125;&#125;^&#123;\mathrm&#123;pre&#125;&#125; = \Theta(q/2^n)</span> . Furthermore, albeit no indifferentiability proof for the BMW hash function is known, we note that BMW can be seen as a combination of the HMAC- and the chop-construction, both proven indifferentiable from a random oracle [26]. We remark that a distinguisher for the compression function of BMW is derived in [5].</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>3.3.</strong> The <strong>CubeHash</strong> hash function [12] is a chop-MD construction, with a final transformation before chopping. The compression function f is permutation based, and the final transformation g consists of flipping a certain bit in the state and applying 10 more compression function rounds on zero-messages.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Security of CubeHash. The compression function of CubeHash is based on one permutation<sup>5</sup>, and collisions and preimages for the compression function can be found in one query to the permutation [20]. The CubeHash hash function is as parazoa design proven indifferentiable from a random oracle if the underlying permutation is assumed to be ideal [1]. Using Thm. 2, this indifferentiability bound additionally renders an optimal collision resistance bound for CubeHash,  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;^&#123;\mathrm&#123;col&#125;&#125;_&#123;\mathcal&#123;H&#125;&#125; = \Theta(q^2/2^n)</span> , as well as an improved upper bound  <span class="math">O\left(\frac&#123;q&#125;&#123;2^n&#125; + \frac&#123;q^2&#125;&#123;2^&#123;l-n&#125;&#125;\right)</span>  on the preimage and second preimage resistance. Note that these bounds are optimal for the n=256 variant.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>3.4.</strong> The <strong>ECHO</strong> hash function [11] is a chop-HAIFA construction. The message blocks are accompanied with a HAIFA-counter, and more generally, the function employs a suffix- and prefix-free padding rule. The compression function f is block cipher based<sup>6</sup>.

      <p class="text-gray-300">Security of Shabal. A bound on the collision resistance of the compression function of Shabal is derived in [24]. Concretely, it is proven that the Shabal compression function is collision resistant up to  <span class="math">q = 2^&#123;(l-m)/2&#125;</span>  queries. Thm. 1 applies to Shabal. Collision and preimage resistance of Shabal are studied in [24], yielding optimal bounds  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;^&#123;\mathrm&#123;pre&#125;&#125;_&#123;\mathcal&#123;H&#125;&#125; = \Theta(q/2^n)</span>  and  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;^&#123;\mathrm&#123;col&#125;&#125;_&#123;\mathcal&#123;H&#125;&#125; = \Theta(q^2/2^n)</span> .

      <p class="text-gray-300">Security of SHAvite-3. The compression function of SHAvite-3 is the PGV5 compression function, and the security results of [21] carry over. As a consequence, we obtain optimal security bounds on the compression function. The mode of operation of SHAvite-3 is based on the HAIFA structure, and as a consequence all security properties regarding this type hold [18]. In particular, the design preserves collision resistance, and as a consequence we obtain  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;^&#123;\mathrm&#123;col&#125;&#125;_&#123;\mathcal&#123;H&#125;&#125; = \Theta(q^2/2^n)</span> . Also, the design is secure against second preimage attacks.

Finally, the SHAvite-3 hash function is indifferentiable from a random oracle if the underlying block cipher is assumed to be ideal, due to the prefix-free padding [26]. This result has been improved under the assumption that the underlying compression function is ideal [16]. However, the compression function of SHAvite-3 is easily differentiable from a random oracle due to the presence of fixed-points.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>3.14.</strong> The <strong>Skein</strong> hash function [31] is a chop-MD construction. The message blocks are accompanied with a round-specific tweak<sup>11</sup>, and more generally, the function employs a suffix- and prefix-free</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">Security of Skein. The compression function of Skein is the PGV1 compression function, with a difference that a tweak is involved. As claimed in [10], the results of [21] carry over, which in turn results in optimal security bounds on the compression function. Thm. 1 applies to Skein, and as a consequence we obtain  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;^&#123;\mathrm&#123;col&#125;&#125;_&#123;\mathcal&#123;H&#125;&#125; = \Theta(q^2/2^n)</span> .

Furthermore, the Skein hash function is proven indifferentiable from a random oracle if the underlying tweakable block cipher is assumed to be ideal [10]. This proof is based on the preimage-awareness approach [30]. Using Thm. 2, this indifferentiability bound additionally renders an improved upper bound  <span class="math">O\left(\frac&#123;q&#125;&#123;2^n&#125; + \frac&#123;q^2&#125;&#123;2^l&#125;\right)</span>  on the second preimage resistance. Note that this bound is optimal for the n=256 variant.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">In this survey, we compared the security achieved by the remaining round 2 SHA-3 hash function candidates, when their underlying primitives are assumed to be ideal. The main contribution of this paper is the summary of the security reductions for the hash function candidates in Table 1. Before giving an interpretation of these results, we first make some remarks on the provided classification.</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-1 my-2">
        <li>Assuming ideality of the underlying primitives (permutations or block ciphers) is not realistic. In particular, none of the candidates' primitives is ideal, and some even have identified weaknesses.</li>
      <p class="text-gray-300">However, assuming ideality of these primitives gives significantly more confidence in the security of the higher level structure and is the only way to get useful (and comparable) security bounds on the candidate hash functions;</p>
        <li>The fact that different hash functions have different bounds, does not directly imply that one of the functions offers a higher level of security: albeit the underlying structure of the basic primitives is abstracted away (see the previous item), still many differences among the schemes remain (chaining size, message input size, etc.). Moreover, not all bounds are tight.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Security of the compression function. For the sponge(-like) hash functions, CubeHash, Fugue, JH, Keccak and Luffa, collisions and preimages for the compression function can be found in a constant number of queries. This does not have direct implications for the security of the hash function. In fact, the only consequence is that it becomes unreasonable to assume ideality of the compression function in order to prove security at a higher level. Most of the remaining nine candidates are provided with a tight bound for collision and/or preimage resistance of the compression function, merely due to the results of [21,62]. Single exceptions are BLAKE and BMW, for which the results of [62] are not directly applicable. No security results are known for the second preimage resistance of the nine remaining candidates: albeit collision resistance implies second preimage resistance [59], the obtained security bounds would be below the requirements of NIST [55];</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Indifferentiability of the hash function. Nine of the candidates are proven indifferentiable from a random oracle, and six of the candidates have a similar constructions to ones proven indifferentiable. We note that there exist some differences among the bounds. For instance, for the hash function variant outputting n = 512 bits, the indifferentiability bounds vary between  <span class="math">O(Kq^3/2^&#123;512&#125;)</span>  and  <span class="math">O((Kq)^2/2^&#123;1024&#125;)</span> . These differences are mainly caused by the fact that the bounds are parameterized by the internal chaining value size l, rather than the output size n (as is the case for bounds on the collision resistance). As a consequence, a higher state size often</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">consists of another execution of the compression function, with an output-specific tweak and with message  <span class="math">0^m</span> . As we included this final message block in the padding, the given description of Skein suffices.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">results in a better indifferentiability bound. The indifferentiability results are powerful, as they render bounds on the (second) preimage and collision resistance of the design (Thm. [2\)](#page-16-1);</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">(Second) preimage resistance of the hash function. Most of the hash functions are not provided with an optimal security bound on the second preimage resistance. Main cause for this is that the MD design does not preserve second preimage resistance [\[3\]](#page-13-4). Additionally, the second preimage bound that can be derived via the indifferentiability (Thm. [2\)](#page-16-1) is not always sufficiently tight. Proving security against these attacks could be attempted either by making a different (possibly weaker) assumption on the compression function or by basing it directly on the ideality of the underlying block cipher or permutation(s). We notice that a fruitful direction might be the graph based approach followed by the designers of Shabal [\[24\]](#page-13-25);</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Collision resistance of the hash function. Except for the sponge(-like) functions, the collision resistance preservation result of Thm. [1](#page-15-1) (App. [A\)](#page-15-0) applies to all candidates. This theorem results in a bound on the generic collision resistance of the hash function, which, intuitively, means that 'finding collisions for the hash function is at least as hard as finding collisions for (one of) the underlying function(s)'. Together with the collision resistance bounds on the compression functions in the ideal model, the preservation result allows for obtaining a collision resistance bound on the entire hash function. This leads to optimal bounds on the collision resistance for ECHO, Grøstl, Hamsi, SHAvite-3, SIMD and Skein. For BLAKE, CubeHash, Fugue, JH, Keccak and Shabal, the same optimal bound is obtained differently (e.g. based on the indifferentiability of the hash function). Again, the graph based approach may be suitable to prove collision resistance of the candidates for which no collision resistance bound is yet obtained.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">A hash function that is provided with a sound security analysis, is not necessarily a 'good' function, nor is it a 'bad' function if only little security results are known. The quality of the hash function depends further on other criteria not covered in this classification, such as the strength of the basic underlying primitives and software/hardware performance. Yet, security reductions guarantee that the hash function has no severe structural weaknesses, and in particular that the design does not suffer weaknesses that can be trivially exploited by cryptanalysts. Therefore, we see the provided security analysis as a fair comparison of the SHA-3 candidates and an important contribution to the selection of the finalists. To the best of our knowledge, we included all security results to date. However, we welcome suggestions, remarks or information about provable security results that could improve the quality of this work.</p>

A green box indicates the existence of a non-trivial upper bound which is not yet optimal for both the 256 and 512 bits variant. A red box means that an efficient adversary is known for the security notion. We note that for all candidates, a red box does not have any direct consequences for the security of the hash function. All other notions and notations and further explained in Sect. 2. Table 1. A schematic summary of all results. The first column describes the hash function construction, and the second and third column show which hash functions have a suffix-free (sf) or prefix-free (pf) padding. The fourth column summarizes the main parameters n, l, m, which denote the hash function output size, the chaining value size

The result of Thm. 1 differs in three cases: we consider any suffix-free padding, the proof allows for different compression functions in one hash function evaluation, and it includes an optional chopping at the end.

Then, the advantage of finding collisions for  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;H&#125;</span>  is upper bounded by the advantage of finding collisions for f or g'. Formally, if f is  <span class="math">(t_1, \varepsilon_1)</span>  collision secure, and g' is  <span class="math">(t_2, \varepsilon_2)</span>  collision secure, then  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;H&#125;</span>  is  <span class="math">(t, \varepsilon)</span>  collision secure for  <span class="math">\varepsilon = \varepsilon_1 + \varepsilon_2</span> , and  <span class="math">t = \min\&#123;t_1, t_2\&#125; - 2(K - 1)\tau_f</span> , where  <span class="math">\tau_f</span>  is the time to evaluate f and K is the maximum length of the messages, in blocks.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof.</em> Suppose  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;A&#125;</span>  is a  <span class="math">(t, \varepsilon)</span>  collision finding attacker for  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;H&#125;</span> . We construct collision finding adversaries  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;B&#125;_1</span>  and  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;B&#125;_2</span>  for f and g, respectively, using the following observation.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Let M, M' be two distinct messages such that  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;H&#125;(M) = \mathcal&#123;H&#125;(M')</span> . Let  <span class="math">(M_1, \ldots, M_k)</span>  be the padded message of M, and  <span class="math">(M'_1, \ldots, M'_&#123;k'&#125;)</span>  be the padded message of M'. Define the intermediate state values  <span class="math">h_i, h'_i</span>  similarly. A collision on M, M' means that  <span class="math">\mathsf&#123;chop&#125;_&#123;l-n&#125;\big(g(h_&#123;k-1&#125;, M_k)\big) = \mathsf&#123;chop&#125;_&#123;l-n&#125;\big(g(h'_&#123;k'-1&#125;, M'_&#123;k'&#125;)\big)</span> . Now, if  <span class="math">(h_&#123;k-1&#125;, M_k) \neq (h'_&#123;k'-1&#125;, M'_&#123;k'&#125;)</span>  this results in a collision for g'. Assume the contrary, and let  <span class="math">j \in \&#123;1, \ldots, \min\&#123;k, k'\&#125; - 1\&#125;</span>  be the minimal index such that  <span class="math">(h_&#123;k-j-1&#125;, M_&#123;k-j&#125;) \neq (h'_&#123;k'-j-1&#125;, M'_&#123;k'-j&#125;)</span> . We notice that such index j exists: in case k = k' it exists as  <span class="math">M \neq M'</span> , and in case  <span class="math">k \neq k'</span>  it exists as the padding rule is suffix-free. By definition of the index j, we have  <span class="math">h_&#123;k-j&#125; = h'_&#123;k'-j&#125;</span> , and in particular we obtain a collision for f:</p>
      <div class="math-block">f(h_&#123;k-j-1&#125;, M_&#123;k-j&#125;) = h_&#123;k-j&#125; = h'_&#123;k'-j&#125; = f(h'_&#123;k'-j-1&#125;, M'_&#123;k'-j&#125;).</div>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Both  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;B&#125;_1, \mathcal&#123;B&#125;_2</span>  follow this procedure. If M, M' define a collision for f,  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;B&#125;_1</span>  outputs this collision. Similarly for  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;B&#125;_2</span>  and g'. Both adversaries work in time at most  <span class="math">t + 2(K - 1)\tau_f</span> , from which we deduce  <span class="math">t \ge \min\&#123;t_1, t_2\&#125; - 2(K - 1)\tau_f</span> . The messages M, M' define a collision for f or g'. Thus, we obtain  <span class="math">\varepsilon \le \varepsilon_1 + \varepsilon_2</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">In case the design is based on the compression function f only (but it may still include the chopping), the above result can easily be simplified to  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;_&#123;\mathcal&#123;H&#125;&#125;^&#123;\mathrm&#123;gcol&#125;&#125;(\mathcal&#123;A&#125;) \leq \mathbf&#123;Adv&#125;_&#123;f'&#125;^&#123;\mathrm&#123;gcol&#125;&#125;(\mathcal&#123;B&#125;_1)</span> , where f' is defined by  <span class="math">f' = \mathsf&#123;chop&#125;_&#123;l-n&#125; \circ f</span> . Observe that this result also holds if l = n, and in particular, the basic theorems of Merkle and Damgård are covered as well. We note that Thm. 1 can be generalized arbitrarily, e.g. to more different compression functions, but for the purpose of this paper, the mentioned generalization of the Merkle-Damgård structure suffices.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">Indifferentiability assures that a design is structurally correct, and that it can replace a random oracle without security loss. In particular, it guarantees that, up to a certain degree, the design is secured against any generic attack, like finding preimages, collisions, multicollisions, etc. In Thm. 2, we formally prove a security reduction to derive security against specific attacks from the indifferentiability of a hash function. This proof is based on a personal communication with Joan Daemen.</p>
      <span id="page-16-1"></span>**Theorem 2.** Let  $\mathcal&#123;H&#125;$  be a hash function, built on underlying primitive  $\pi$ , and RO be a random oracle, where  $\mathcal&#123;H&#125;$  and RO have the same domain and range space.

Let atk be a security property of  $\mathcal&#123;H&#125;$ .

Then:

      <p class="text-gray-300">Proof.

    <h3 id="sec-2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1 Introduction</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Current public-key security recommendations have influenced a concentrated effort from the pairing-based community towards optimizing the implementation of pairings on Barreto-Naehrig (BN) curves [4]. Indeed, aside from an array of many other attractive properties (see [20, 23] for more details), BN curves are perfectly suited to the security level of 128 bits (cf. [2], [32], and [12, §1.1]), since they achieve an optimal balance between the necessary sizes of the three groups involved in the pairing e : G<sup>1</sup> × G<sup>2</sup> → G<sup>T</sup> . The BN pairing speed record of 10 million cycles set by Hankerson et al. in 2008 [14] stood until mid 2010, when</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>?</sup> Acknowledges funding from the Australian-American Fulbright Commission, the Queensland Government Smart State PhD Scholarship, and an Australian Postgraduate Award.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">three papers appeared in rapid succession [22,7,1], each one shaving more time off the previous record and pushing the limit of efficiency at this security level. This work was pinnacled by Aranha <em>et al.</em> [1], who applied a combination of improvements to accelerate the entire pairing computation to less than 2 million cycles. As implementors seemingly converge towards a "satisfaction asymptote" at the 128-bit security level, the focus is now beginning to shift to optimizing pairings at higher security levels.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As Scott details [25], scaling security in pairing-based cryptography is fundamentally different than doing so in traditional public-key protocols that only require one group definition. Whilst increasing the security of other number theoretic protocols usually requires an increase in the size of the modulus, an optimized scaling in the context of pairing-based cryptography can be achieved by increasing the embedding degree. Utilizing the flexibility of a higher embedding degree allows an implementor to inflate the size of the finite field target group  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_T</span>  at a greater rate than the corresponding inflation in the elliptic curve groups  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span> , paying respect to the faster subexponential attacks that must be resisted in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_T</span> . Stepping up to a significantly higher security level therefore calls for a different family of pairing-friendly elliptic curves altogether, and although many of the previous optimizations (e.g. for BN curves) can be immediately or easily transferred to computing pairings on the new curves, there are naturally new issues that arise when advancing towards a thorough optimization.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This work focuses on pairings that employ the Barreto-Lynn-Scott (BLS) family with k=24 [3] (see also [12, §6.6]). The BLS family has already been identified as the prime candidate for 256-bit secure pairings by Scott [27], who now holds the current software speed record at this level. The aim of this paper is to provide some of the finer details that will begin to pave the way for implementors who may wish to further accelerate the state-of-the-art timings on BLS curves. The bulk of our discussion is motivated by Pereira et al.'s work in the case of BN curves [23], where they detail a very simple method of generating highly optimal instantiations of implementation-friendly BN curves. With the same intent, we point out four highly attractive subfamilies of BLS curves that facilitate very efficient instantiations of high-security pairings.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The proposed curves are found by restricting the search parameter x in the polynomial representation to any one of four specific congruency classes, namely  <span class="math">x_0 \\equiv 7, 16, 31, 64 \\pmod{72}</span> . These choices result in prime fields of characteristic  <span class="math">p \\equiv 19 \\pmod{24}</span> , which in turn leads to three very efficient towering options for the full extension field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{24}}</span> . We show that all curves found in any of the proposed subfamilies can immediately be given by the same short Weierstraß equation over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> , and the unique sextic twist E' of correct order for use in the ate pairing setting is automatically determined. Not only is there no computational effort necessary to write down the curve equations once the prime p is found, both E and E' can be represented very compactly by the polynomial parameter  <span class="math">x_0</span>  alone.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We give some details on line function computation and discuss an efficient version of the hard part in the final exponentiation. As a resource for implementors,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">we give elaborate lists of example curves covering a range of high-security levels between 192- and 320-bit security, including the dedicated BLS security level of 256 bits. We have chosen the examples with a very sparse parameter x which leads to a low number of addition steps in the Miller loop and simultaneously very efficient exponentiations by x, which are needed in the final exponentiation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a brief background on the BLS family for embedding degree k=24 and on computing optimal pairings on BLS curves. Section 3 describes the proposed implementation-friendly subfamilies of BLS curves, whilst Section 4 details some choices that can facilitate more simple pairing code. In Section 5 we apply the work of Scott <em>et al.</em> [29] to give details on the final exponentiation routine. Lists of example curves at several security levels are presented in Section 6. Finally, Appendix A provides timing results of a C implementation of the optimal ate pairing on BLS curves.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The BLS family with embedding degree 24. In [3], Barreto, Lynn and Scott propose polynomial parametrizations for certain complete pairing-friendly curve families for specific fixed embedding degrees. All curves belonging to one of these so-called cyclotomic families have CM discriminant D=3 (i.e. j-invariant j=0) and can be given by a short Weierstraß equation  <span class="math">E: y^2 = x^3 + b</span> . For embedding degree k=24, the Barreto-Lynn-Scott (BLS) family is given by the following parametrization (see also [12, Construction 6.6]):</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">p(x) = (x-1)^{2}(x^{8} - x^{4} + 1)/3 + x, r(x) = x^{8} - x^{4} + 1,</span></div>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">n(x) = (x-1)^{2}(x^{8} - x^{4} + 1)/3, t(x) = x + 1,</span></div>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">f(x) = (x-1)(2x^{4} - 1)/3. (1)</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finding a specific BLS curve is achieved by running through integer values  <span class="math">x_0 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}</span>  until  <span class="math">p(x_0)</span>  and  <span class="math">r(x_0)</span>  are both prime (note that  <span class="math">x_0 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}</span>  leads to all involved parameters being integers). For each set of parameters, there exists an elliptic curve E over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  such that  <span class="math">\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_p) = n(x_0)</span> . The correct curve E can be found by trying different values for e (i.e. different twists) and checking for the right group order. Another alternative is to compute the coefficient by the algorithm described in [24]. Since  <span class="math">r(x_0) \\mid n(x_0)</span> , there is a subgroup of  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_p)</span>  of prime order  <span class="math">r(x_0)</span> . The CM discriminant is p0 and p1 because p2. The family has a p2-value of p3 decays p3. The family has a p5-value of p4 degp7 degp8.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">BLS curves achieve the smallest  <span class="math">\\rho</span> -value for k=24 (see [12, Section 8]); they have twists of degree 6 and allow for many optimizations when computing pairings, similar to Barreto-Naehrig (BN) curves. A particularly nice property is that the ate pairing [15] already provides an optimal pairing [33]. The number of iterations in Miller's algorithm to compute the ate pairing is  <span class="math">\\log(t(x_0)-1) = \\log(x_0) \\approx \\log(r(x_0))/\\varphi(k) = \\log(r(x_0))/8</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">According to key size recommendations in [2], [32], and [12, Section 1], BLS curves are a good choice for pairings at the high-security 256-bit level. Indeed,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Scott [27] recently demonstrated an efficient implementation of pairings on BLS curves at that level.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">An optimal ate pairing. We now briefly recall the ate pairing on BLS curves and the arithmetic that is involved in its computation. Let  <span class="math">E/\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  be a BLS curve with parameters constructed as above given an integer  <span class="math">x_0 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}</span> , i.e.  <span class="math">p = p(x_0)</span> ,  <span class="math">r = r(x_0)</span>  and so forth. Then there exists a unique twist  <span class="math">E&#x27;/\\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span>  with  <span class="math">r \\mid \\#E&#x27;(\\mathbb{F}_{p^4})</span>  with twisting isomorphism  <span class="math">\\psi : E&#x27; \\to E</span>  over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span> . Let us define the usual groups  <span class="math">G_1 = E(\\mathbb{F}_p)[r]</span>  and  <span class="math">G_2 = \\ker(\\phi_p - [p]) \\subset E(\\mathbb{F}_{p^{24}})[r]</span>  as the 1- and p-eigenspaces of the Frobenius endomorphism  <span class="math">\\phi_p</span>  on E[r]. Let the group  <span class="math">G&#x27;_2 = \\psi^{-1}(G_2)</span>  be the preimage of  <span class="math">G_2</span>  under  <span class="math">\\psi</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let T=t-1. As outlined in [9], we can either compute the original ate pairing</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">a_T: G_2&#x27; \\times G_1 \\to \\mathbb{F}_{p^{24}}^*, \\ (Q&#x27;, P) \\mapsto f_{T, \\psi(Q&#x27;)}(P)^{\\frac{p^{24} - 1}{r}},</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">by "untwisting" Q' for the computation of  <span class="math">f_{T,\\psi(Q&#x27;)}</span> ; or we can compute</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">a&#x27;_T: G&#x27;_2 \\times G_1 \\to \\mathbb{F}^*_{p^{24}}, \\ (Q&#x27;, P) \\mapsto f_{T, Q&#x27;}(\\psi^{-1}(P))^{\\frac{p^{24} - 1}{r}},</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">i.e. compute entirely on the twist by "twisting" P to E'.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A function  <span class="math">f_{T,R}(S)</span>  for points R,S on E or E' as above is computed with Miller's algorithm [19]. It involves curve arithmetic in  <span class="math">G&#x27;_2</span> , i.e. doubling and addition of points on the curve E' over the field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span>  and the computation of line functions from points in  <span class="math">G&#x27;_2</span>  evaluated at a point in  <span class="math">G_1</span>  or its preimage under  <span class="math">\\psi</span> . The computations in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span>  for point doubling and addition and for obtaining the corresponding line function coefficients share partial results and are thus usually optimized together. Depending on the context in which the pairing is used and the computing platform, one needs to choose between affine and different variants of projective coordinates to find the best formulas for these operations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The function  <span class="math">f_{T,R}(S)</span>  is built up by accumulating the line function values. This requires efficient squaring and multiplication-by-line-function operations in the full extension field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{24}}</span> . The final exponentiation on elements in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{24}}^*</span>  has a fixed exponent and it is possible to use specialized more efficient squaring operations as well as other optimizations [13, 17, 1]. Full extension field arithmetic needs to be particularly efficient as pairing efficiency strongly depends on it. It is therefore important to work with a well-chosen extension field tower [6].</p>

    <h3 id="sec-4" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3 Particularly friendly subfamilies</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we show that specializing the congruency classes of the curvefinding search parameter gives rise to four subfamilies of k=24 BLS curves that are highly efficient in terms of all operations required in a pairing computation. Specifically, we show that rather than searching with  <span class="math">x_0 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}</span> , searching with any of  <span class="math">x_0 \\equiv 7, 16, 31, 64 \\pmod{72}</span>  guarantees that the curves found offer (among other things) the following advantages.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>The curve constant b is immediately determined (see Proposition 3 below). This saves performing expensive computations that test different values of b and the corresponding group order until the correct twist is found; or the checks for quadratic and cubic residuosity and root computations for the algorithm in [24].</li>

      <li><strong>Highly efficient field tower options are available</strong> (see Proposition 2 below). This facilitates very efficient field arithmetic in the full extension field (and all intermediate subfields).</li>

      <li>The correct twist is immediately determined (see Proposition 4 below). Among other savings, having an automated and general representation for the <em>correct</em> twist saves group arithmetic on curves over the quartic extension field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span>  in the generation phase. Also, the representations of the twists are always simple and facilitate nice back-and-forth isomorphisms between E and E'.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In addition to the above efficiency benefits, generating curves with identical or consistent parameters also offers the advantage of code reusability across different instantiations and security levels. This allows an implementor the flexibility of scaling parameter sizes to better match a neighboring security level without changing any of the pairing code.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Furthermore, having fixed coefficients for the curve and its twist leads to a very compact way of representing the curve data. Note that in this setting, the knowledge of the generating parameter  <span class="math">x_0</span>  uniquely determines all information about both curves. What only remains is to give generators for the groups  <span class="math">G_1</span>  and  <span class="math">G&#x27;_2</span> , except for the case of  <span class="math">x_0 \\equiv 64 \\pmod{72}</span>  for which a compact generator in  <span class="math">G_1</span>  is always available as <a href="3,5">h</a> with high probability, where h is the cofactor, i.e. [h] maps elements of  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_p)</span>  into  <span class="math">G_1</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 1. Four attractive subfamilies of BLS curves</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We split the rest of this section into two subsections. The first subsection is dedicated to proving the claims in Table 1 and showing that taking  <span class="math">x_0 \\equiv 7, 16, 31, 64 \\pmod{72}</span>  will always give rise to highly efficient BLS instantiations. The intention of the second subsection is to detail why  <span class="math">x_0 \\equiv 7, 16, 31, 64 \\pmod{72}</span>  reign supreme over the other possible congruence classes.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-5" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">3.1 Using the four classes <span class="math">x_0 \\equiv 7, 16, 31, 64 \\pmod{72}</span></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We start with a lemma that is instrumental in some of the proofs that follow. For a prime p, let QR(p) denote the set of quadratic residues modulo p.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lemma 1.</strong> Let  <span class="math">x_0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}</span>  be any of  <span class="math">x_0 \\equiv 7, 16, 31, 64 \\pmod{72}</span> , and let  <span class="math">p = p(x_0)</span>  with p given by (1) be a prime. Then 2 is neither a quadratic nor a cubic residue modulo p.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof.</em> A simple calculation shows that for  <span class="math">x_0 \\equiv 7, 16, 64 \\pmod{72}</span> , we have  <span class="math">p(x_0) \\equiv 19 \\pmod{72}</span> . For  <span class="math">x_0 \\equiv 31 \\pmod{72}</span> , we have  <span class="math">p(x_0) \\equiv 43 \\pmod{72}</span> . In both cases, it is easy to deduce that  <span class="math">2 \\notin QR(p)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It remains to show that 2 is not a cube modulo p for each of the  <span class="math">x_0</span>  values. For all four cases, we use [16, Prop. 9.6.2], which states that for  <span class="math">p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}</span> , 2 is a cubic residue modulo p if and only if there exist integers C, D such that  <span class="math">p = C^2 + 27D^2</span> . According to [16, Prop. 8.3.2], for  <span class="math">p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}</span>  there always exist integers A and B such that  <span class="math">4p = A^2 + 27B^2</span>  and A, B are unique up to sign. Thus, if A and B in this unique representation are both even, 2 is a cube modulo p, otherwise it is not. In each of the four cases  <span class="math">x_0 \\equiv 7, 16, 31, 64 \\pmod{72}</span> , we examine A and B in terms of the polynomials from (1).

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof.</em> It is well known that if g is neither a square nor a cube in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> , then all possible group orders an elliptic curve  <span class="math">E: y^2 = x^3 + b</span>  can have over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  occur as the order of one of the 6 twists with  <span class="math">b \\in \\{1, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5\\}</span> . Specifically, choosing b as exactly one of  <span class="math">\\{1, g, g^2, g^3, g^4, g^5\\}</span>  will give the correct number of points (cf.  <span class="math">[31, \\S X.5]</span> ), i.e. the curve with  <span class="math">r \\mid n = \\#E(\\mathbb{F}_p)</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">We compute both  <span class="math">n_{4,1}</span>  and  <span class="math">n_{4,2}</span>  as polynomials in terms of the parametrization (1), and evaluate them at each of the congruency classes which reveals opposing parities each time. The remainder of the proof is essentially the same for all four congruencies classes, so we demonstrate completely with  <span class="math">x_0 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{72}</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proposition 2 shows that v is neither a square nor a cube in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span> , so the correct twist can be given as  <span class="math">y^2 = x^3 + 4v</span>  or as  <span class="math">y^2 = x^3 + 4v^5</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">exponent on the right hand side of the last equation is divisible by 3, we conclude that 4v is a cube in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span> . Similarly, one can show that  <span class="math">4v^5</span>  is not a cube. Since 4v is a cube, the curve  <span class="math">y^2 = x^3 + 4v</span>  has a point of order 2, namely (-c, 0) with  <span class="math">c^3 = 4v</span> . Hence its order is even and we have found the correct twist for  <span class="math">x_0 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{72}</span> . The other three cases are proven analogously.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Quadratic extension to  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}</span> : We start by eliminating the classes of  <span class="math">x_0</span>  mod 72 which do not facilitate the quadratic extension as  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2} = \\mathbb{F}_p(u)</span> ,  <span class="math">u^2 + 1 = 0</span> . Of the 24 possible  <span class="math">x_0</span>  values modulo 72 in  <span class="math">\\{1, 4, 7, ..., 67, 70\\}</span> , 12 have  <span class="math">x_0 \\equiv 1, 10 \\pmod{12}</span> , which always (undesirably) produce  <span class="math">p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}</span> . The remaining 12 are  <span class="math">\\{4, 7, 16, 19, 28, 31, 40, 43, 52, 55, 64, 67\\}</span>  with  <span class="math">x_0 = 4, 7 \\pmod{12}</span> , which always produce  <span class="math">p(x_0) \\equiv 7 \\pmod{12}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Quadratic extension to  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span> : If  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span>  is to be constructed as  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^4} = \\mathbb{F}_{p^2}(v)</span> ,  <span class="math">v^2 + u + 1 = 0</span> , then (refer back to the proof of Proposition 2) we can only guarantee this if  <span class="math">N_{\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}/\\mathbb{F}_p}(-(u+1)) = 2</span>  is not a quadratic residue in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> . Substituting the remaining 12 candidates for  <span class="math">x_0 \\pmod{72}</span>  into (1) reveals only 4 possibilities for  <span class="math">p \\pmod{72}</span> , those being  <span class="math">p \\equiv 7, 19, 43, 55 \\pmod{72}</span> . It is easy to check that only two of these have  <span class="math">2 \\notin \\mathrm{QR}(p)</span> , namely  <span class="math">p \\equiv 19, 43 \\pmod{72}</span> .

For the sake of counter examples,  <span class="math">x_0 = 12856 \\equiv 40 \\pmod{72}</span>  and  <span class="math">x_0 = 1135 \\equiv 55 \\pmod{72}</span>  produce BLS curves where 2 is a cube modulo p, and therefore fields which can not use the tower in Proposition 2. Even if alternative binomials can be found in such cases, the fact that 2 is a cubic residue also affects the ease of guaranteeing the smallest identical curve constant p for all curves in the subfamily, as we were able to do for the proposed four congruency classes in Proposition 3. For example, the smallest curve constant for the curve found with  <span class="math">x_0 = 12856 \\equiv 40 \\pmod{72}</span>  is p = -3, whilst the smallest constant for the curve found with  <span class="math">p = 25312 \\equiv 40 \\pmod{72}</span>  is p = -3, whilst the smallest constant for the curve found with  <span class="math">p = 25312 \\equiv 40 \\pmod{72}</span>  is p = -3.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-7" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">4 Choosing simple lines: twisting vs. untwisting</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The aim of this short section is to detail some choices that can facilitate more simple (and theoretically faster) pairing code.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For 128-bit security BN implementations, the complexity of a single Miller loop is higher than complexity of a single final exponentiation (see any of [22, 7,1]). However, as the security level and embedding degree increases, a final exponentiation becomes much more costly than a Miller loop [11] (or see our timings in Appendix A). This could influence implementors paying less attention to more complicated subtleties within the Miller loop, like adopting projective coordinates, and instead focusing on speedups within the exponentiation routine. On the other hand, a large number of recent pairing protocols like attribute-based encryption (ABE) require many Miller loops for each exponentiation (see Scott's recent work [27] for an in depth look), and therefore in these scenarios savings within the loop again become more significant overall. In any case, a thoroughly optimized implementation will make use of the fastest formulas inside the Miller loop, so even though our implementation slightly favored affine coordinates, and indeed Scott's current 256-bit record [27] also employed affine coordinates, it could well be that a thoroughly optimized projective routine (like [1] for k=12) ends up outperforming affine formulas at this level too. We refer to [8,9,18] for ways to find the most efficient coordinate system depending on the specific protocol and implementation situation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As we mentioned briefly in the previous section, the choice of which tower  <span class="math">(T_1, T_2, T_3)</span>  in Proposition 2) to use in an implementation could be influenced by a number of factors. For example, if low bandwidth requirements favored maximum compression techniques [28], then  <span class="math">T_1</span>  would seem most appropriate. On the other hand, if the major priority is raw speed, then one could employ the field arithmetic presented in [10, §6] and favor the (slightly faster) quadratic over cubic extension offered by  <span class="math">T_3</span> . Or perhaps most commonly, if the implementor is adopting BLS curves to scale a prior (say BN) pairing implementation to a higher security level, then the towered code for the BN sextic extension from  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}</span>  to  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}</span>  could be easily updated to BLS code for the extension from  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span>  to  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{24}}</span> . In any case, there are efficient formulas available for all three of the towering choices [10, 9], so we will treat all three cases in parallel and highlight the differences that arise.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One such difference lies in the sparse doubling and addition lines that are used to update the pairing function. For each of the proposed congruency classes, Table 2 follows the exposition in [26,  <span class="math">\\S 5</span> ] and details the correct placing of the line function coefficients for the three tower choices  <span class="math">T_1, T_2, T_3</span>  and the two twist choices in Proposition 4, both of which have the same group order but result in different looking line functions.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The point P is always kept in affine coordinates  <span class="math">(x_P, y_P)</span> . For the affine formulas the line simply is  <span class="math">\\ell(P) = y_P - \\lambda x_P - c</span> , where  <span class="math">\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span>  is the slope of the line as usual and  <span class="math">c \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span>  is the constant coefficient. Projective formulas for these line functions usually output three coefficients  <span class="math">L_{0,0}, L_{1,0}, L_{0,1} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span>  [9] that define the evaluated update  <span class="math">\\ell(P) = L_{0,0} + L_{1,0}x_{\\psi^{-1}(P)} + L_{0,1}y_{\\psi^{-1}(P)} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^{24}}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">by being attached to different algebraic elements in the representation of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{24}}</span>  over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span>  depending on the twisting isomorphism  <span class="math">\\psi</span> . In all cases  <span class="math">\\ell(P)</span>  is a sparse element of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{24}}</span> , with the only difference being the places that the  <span class="math">\\ell_i</span>  occupy as a result of the different algebraic towerings and maybe a sign change.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To explain the different lines in Table 2, let us briefly look at the conversion between representations of an element in the different towering options  <span class="math">T_1, T_2</span> , and  <span class="math">T_3</span> . Let us start with an element a in  <span class="math">T_2</span>  given by the coefficients  <span class="math">a_0, \\ldots, a_5 \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span> , i.e.  <span class="math">a=a_0+a_1z+a_2z^2+a_3z^3+a_4z^4+a_5z^5</span> . Converting to  <span class="math">T_1</span> , we take  <span class="math">z^3\\mapsto w</span>  and thus the same element is represented as  <span class="math">a=(a_0+a_3w)+(a_1+a_4w)z+(a_2+a_5w)z^2</span> . To go to  <span class="math">T_3</span> , we use  <span class="math">z\\mapsto -uz</span>  (i.e.  <span class="math">z^2\\mapsto w</span> ) and obtain  <span class="math">a=(a_0+a_2w+a_4w^2)+(-a_1u-a_3uw-a_5uw^2)z</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">An optimized routine must take advantage of the sparse nature of  <span class="math">\\ell(P)</span>  and tailor make a specialized multiplication routine to exploit the presence of zero entries. Roughly speaking, the options in Table 2 will give rise to similar speeds, but it is obvious to see which twist constant an implementor would choose (all other things being equal) if their choice of tower is already concrete. For example, if  <span class="math">T_1</span>  is the chosen tower, then using b' = 4v gives a slightly easier line function to code than using b' = 4v.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A more important difference arises when choosing whether to leave  <span class="math">P \\in E</span>  and "untwist"  <span class="math">Q&#x27; \\in E&#x27;</span>  to  <span class="math">Q \\in E</span>  for the line function computation, or choosing to put both points on the twist for the entire routine [9]. The nature of the proposed tower actually means that there is a significant difference between the simplicity of the twisting and untwisting isomorphisms, and one option will be more desirable to implement than the other. For example, when using  <span class="math">T_1</span>  and b' = -4v, the untwisting isomorphism  <span class="math">\\psi</span>  is  <span class="math">\\psi: (x&#x27;, y&#x27;) \\mapsto (x/z^2, y/w) = (wvz(u-1)/2 \\cdot x&#x27;, wv(1-u)/2 \\cdot y&#x27;)</span> , which is more annoying to code (and theoretically slightly slower) than using  <span class="math">\\psi^{-1}: (x,y) \\mapsto (z^2x, wy)</span>  to twist the second argument P instead. On the other hand, if the twist is given as  <span class="math">E&#x27;: y^2 = x^3 \\pm b/v</span> , as is the cases when  <span class="math">x_0 \\equiv 7,64 \\pmod{72}</span> , then it is the untwisting isomorphism that is clearly preferable.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-8" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">5 The final exponentiation</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">An optimized final exponentiation routine is critical for fast pairings at high-security levels. Scott <em>et al.</em> [29] propose the most efficient algorithm to date, which exploits the polynomial representations of p and r to reduce the work encountered after the Miller loop. The first step is to split the exponent into two parts by factoring  <span class="math">(p^k-1)/r</span>  and exploiting the Frobenius operator which raises elements to the power of p almost for free. In our case the exponent splits as:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">(p^{24}-1)/r = [(p^{12}-1)\\cdot(p^4+1)]\\cdot \\underbrace{[(p^8-p^4+1)/r]}_{\\text{hard part}}.</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">After exploiting Frobenius operations to quickly raise the output of the Miller loop to the exponent in the left square parentheses, we then face the major</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Table 3.</strong> The final exponentiation for BLS curves with k=24</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This is where the BLS pairing computation benefits most from the faster squarings in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{24}}</span> , and also from an  <span class="math">x_0</span>  value that has low hamming-weight which reduces the  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{24}}</span>  multiplications encountered. In the following section we give several examples of very low hamming-weight  <span class="math">x_0</span>  values that give rise to curves in the proposed implementation-friendly BLS subfamily.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-9" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">6 Example curves</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This section provides four lists of implementation-friendly BLS curves at security levels where the entire BLS family is either competitive across all families, or is clearly the current outright favorite. Each list (Table 4 through to Table 7) corresponds to one of the four proposed subfamilies.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We start with 192-bit security since our timings of a C implementation of the optimal ate pairing at this level (see Appendix A) agreed with Scott's comment [27] that the stand-out candidate curve family at this level is not yet as obvious as the 128- and 256-bit levels. In our implementation both a k=12 BN curve and k=24 BLS curve outperformed a k=18 KSS curve at this level.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Each table lists curves where  <span class="math">x_0</span>  is very sparse in signed binary representation, meaning here that it has weight 3, 4 or 5. Working with signed binary representation for the Miller loop parameter and the powerings in the final exponentiation can be considered standard and extends the space of nice curves compared to just using plain binary representation. Nevertheless, we also included many  <span class="math">x_0</span>  values which have the same plain binary representation as the signed binary representation; these are the  <span class="math">x_0</span>  values which share the same sign for each power of 2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">All curves given have the implementation-friendly properties outlined in the previous sections. In particular, curves in Table 4 and Table 6 have  <span class="math">x_0 \\equiv 7</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(mod 72) and x<sup>0</sup> ≡ 31 (mod 72) respectively, and are given by E : y <sup>2</sup> = x <sup>3</sup> + 1; curves in Table 5 have x<sup>0</sup> ≡ 16 (mod 72) and are given by E : y <sup>2</sup> = x <sup>3</sup> + 4, and curves in Table 7 have x<sup>0</sup> ≡ 64 (mod 72) and are given by y <sup>2</sup> = x <sup>3</sup> − 2. In all cases all parameters are uniquely defined by the short value x0.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The curves in all four tables were found by trying all possibilities for the signed binary representation of x<sup>0</sup> with a fixed weight such that x<sup>0</sup> belongs to the right congruence class modulo 72. In our search, we did not find any curves in the considered range of parameter sizes where x<sup>0</sup> is plus or minus a power of 2 (i.e. weight 1) or where it is a binomial, a sum of two such powers (i.e. weight 2). In this sense, our search indicates that weights 3, 4 and 5 are optimal for the security levels considered in this paper. The even congruencies (x<sup>0</sup> ≡ 16, 64 (mod 72)) gain the slight advantage over the odd congruencies (x<sup>0</sup> ≡ 7, 31 (mod 72)), since the last bit of the binary representation of odd congruencies is obviously forced to be 1. Thus, curves in the even congruency classes commonly have weights 3 and 4 whilst curves in the odd congruency classes commonly have weights 4 and 5. On the other hand, the odd congruencies both give rise to curves with b = 1 which would make for slightly faster point operations, but (all other things being equal) one would probably achieve a faster implementation by taking the x<sup>0</sup> value with the lowest weight possible, since one less bit in x<sup>0</sup> saves over 10 full Fp<sup>24</sup> multiplications per single pairing.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Restricting x<sup>0</sup> to sparse values only results in a certain inflexibility when adjusting the parameter sizes to exact values, for example certain multiples of word sizes on a target implementation platform. However, recent high-speed implementations of pairings at the 128-bit security level have shown that lazy reduction techniques give significant improvements in the field tower arithmetic and thus the overall pairing computation [7, 1]. Such techniques can be employed efficiently when the bit size of the prime characteristic p is a few bits less than a multiple of the word size, which provides a certain space for delaying reductions for field arithmetic. In Tables 4, 5, 6 and 7 we have tried to account for this (as far as possible), by including different choices of curves at each security level that have a varying gap between the prime field size and multiples of standard word sizes 32 and 64, which are also given in the table. We believe that most implementors of pairings in software will find a suitable curve at the desired security level in our tables, or else will be able to find a suitable curve themselves with similar properties.</p>

We give timings for field operations of base field and all extension fields. Timings for pairings are split up into timing for the Miller loop, the final exponentiation, and the complete pairing. The number denoted "Product" refers to the time per pairing in a product of 20 pairings.</p>

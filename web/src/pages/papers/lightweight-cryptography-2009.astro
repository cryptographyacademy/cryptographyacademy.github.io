      <p class="text-gray-300">In the near future myriads of low-cost pervasive computing devices will enable the ubiquitous computing era that is widely believed to be the next paradigm in computing. Along with all its benefits come new security and privacy risks, which, given the severe cost constraints, provide a remarkable challenge. The thesis at hand provides an engineering approach to lightweight cryptography, a research field that aims at providing low-cost cryptographic solutions for constrained devices. Trade-offs for lightweight cryptography are discussed and, since this thesis has a strong emphasis on hardware implementations, application specific integrated circuit design is briefly introduced. Several lightweight cryptographic primitives for encryption, hashing and identification schemes are presented and their implementation for software and hardware platforms is discussed in detail. &shy;</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">8 <strong>bit target platform and development environment</strong></h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The ATMEL AVR RISC<sup>7</sup> microcontroller family uses a <em>Harvard</em> architecture concept, <em>i.e.</em> it uses separate memories and buses for program and data. Its two stage pipeline allows to execute in every clock cycle one instruction and most of its 130 instructions are single cycle instructions [9]. Out of this family we chose the ATmega163 microcontroller [11] as the target platform. Besides other features such as timers and counters, the ATmega163 provides 16 K bytes Flash, 512 bytes EEPROM, 1024 bytes SRAM and 32 general purpose working register. Figure 5.10 depicts the architecture of the ATmega163. Access to the SRAM costs 2 clcock cycles and access to the Flash memory costs 3 clock cycles. The ATmega163 can operate with up to 8 MHz. At a frequency of 4 MHZ and a voltage supply of 3 Volt the ATmega163 draws 5 mA of current when active, 1.9 mA in Idle Mode and less than 1&micro;A in Power-down Mode. The interested reader is referred to the data sheet [11] and the instruction set manual [9] for further details about the ATmega163 microcontroller.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We used the integrated development environment <em>AVR Studio 4.13</em> from ATMEL [10]. It is provided free of charge by ATMEL and supports a wide range of ATMEL's microcontrollers, such as the ATmega series. The <em>AVR Studio</em> features an in-build chip simulator and a source file editor as well as decent project management capabilities. Furthermore it uses the opensource <em>WinAVR</em> tool kit [241] that contains a <em>GNU GCC</em> compiler for C/C++ source, the <em>avr-gdb</em> debugger and the <em>avrdude</em> programmer.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-misc-1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8"><strong>Speed optimized implementation</strong></h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For speed optimization it is wise to pre-compute and store all round keys in an array, because it has to be done only once in the beginning. Since PRESENT requires 32 round keys of each</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 5.10: Architecture of the ATmega163 8 bit microcontroller, source: [11].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">64 bits, in total 256 Bytes of data memory are required. The 61 bit rotation to the left in the key schedule is equivalent to a 19 bit rotation to the right. For the speed optimized variants this rotation was decomposed into a 16 bit and a 3 bit shift to the right. This is advantageous on an 8 bit platform, such as the ATmega163, because a 16 bit shift can be implemented by re-addressing the 8 bit registers in the following way:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$key[i] = key[i + 2 MOD 10], 0 \\le i \\le 9.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally the 61 bit rotation of all 80 bits can be implemented by ten register address swaps and  <span class="math">10 \\cdot 3 = 30</span>  shifting operations. The S-box for the key schedule is stored as 16 8-bit values where the high nibble is the S-box output value and the low nibble is padded with zeros. This allows to immediately OR the S-box output value with the four LSB of the highest key state byte.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The S-Layer of PRESENT consists of  <span class="math">16.4 \\times 4</span>  S-boxes (see Chapter 4). A na&iuml;ve approach would be to select a 4 bit chunk of the current state byte s, substitute it with the 4 bit S-box output value and store the result at the right position of the state. However, this would require to apply an AND operation to the state with a selection mask  <span class="math">(0 \\times F0 \\text{ or } 0 \\times 0F)</span>  and a table lookup. In case that the processed nibble is the higher significant one, additionally a shifting by 4 positions to the left before and after the S-box look-up is required. A more efficient&mdash;and well-known&mdash;technique is to combine two (or more) smaller S-boxes to a larger S-box. By joining two PRESENT S-boxes we get the new  <span class="math">8 \\times 8</span>  S-box:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$S_{8\\times8}(x_1||x_2) = S(x_1)||S(x_2).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">S_{8\\times8}</span>  has 256 entries of each 8 bits. Using  <span class="math">S_{8\\times8}</span>  significantly decreases the cycle count while also significantly increases the memory requirements.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The permutation layer of PRESENT is probably the most difficult part to implement in software, because it processes each of the 64 state bits individually. While in hardware this can be done virtually free of cost, in software this poses severe difficulties. A na&iuml;ve approach would select 64 times a single bit, look-up the shifting offset in a table and shift it to its new position. Since table look-ups require 2 clock cycles this approach would require at least  <span class="math">64 \\cdot (1+2+1) = 256</span>  operations in total. A well-known implementation trick is to use look-up tables instead of permutations. Figure 5.11 depicts the general time-memory trade-off for look-up tables. The left side shows the classic look-up table approach for an n bit permutation, which requires only one look-up to get the result. However, the memory requirements are  <span class="math">2^n \\cdot n</span>  bits. In the case of PRESENT n=64 and hence the memory requirement would be  <span class="math">2^{64} \\cdot 64 = 2^{67}</span>  Bytes, which is by far too much.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Therefore a divide-and-conquer approach with the following steps seems to be better suited:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>(1) Split the <em>n</em> bit word in <em>k</em> parts, each  <span class="math">\\frac{n}{L}</span>  bits wide.</li>
      <li>(2) Create <em>k</em> different tables, each with  <span class="math">2^{\\frac{n}{k}}</span>  entries of <em>n</em> bits.</li>
      <li>(3) Join the <em>k</em> look-up results from the different tables to one final result.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Depending on the joining operation in step 3 (OR, XOR or AND) it is either required to pad the table entries with '0' bits (OR, XOR) or with '1' bits (AND) in step 2. The advantage of this divide-and-conquer approach is that it trades memory for additional time. Since we have k tables each with  <span class="math">2^{\\frac{n}{k}}</span>  entries of n bits, the memory requirement is  <span class="math">k \\cdot 2^{\\frac{n}{k}} \\cdot n</span>  bits. On the other hand now k table look-ups are required and an additional joining operation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">    <img src="_page_91_Figure_1.jpeg" alt="" class="my-4 max-w-full" />
</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 5.11: Time-memory trade-off for look-up tables.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A natural next step for optimizing a software implementation for an 8 bit microcontroller would be to set k=8. While the timing then would be 8+1=9 steps, the memory requirements would be  <span class="math">8\\cdot 2^{\\frac{64}{8}}\\cdot 64</span>  bits  <span class="math">=2^{14}</span>  bytes =16KB. Unfortunately this is the exact amount of Flash memory that our target platform ATmega163 provides and hence this approach does not allow a single additional line of code. Therefore we set k=16 and now it takes 17 steps to process the permutation while the memory requirements are reduced to  <span class="math">16\\cdot 2^{\\frac{64}{16}}\\cdot 64</span>  bits  <span class="math">=2^{11}</span>  bytes =2KB. However, one Flash memory access requires 3 clock cycles, therefore the 8 look-up operations require at least 24 cycles and our timing complexity is about 25 steps. Even worse, one step refers to processing a 64-bit word, which on an 8-bit architecture costs at least 8 cycles each. Therefore the time complexity is around  <span class="math">25\\cdot 8=200</span>  clock cycles. In the end this was the main reason to implement the P-layer in assembly, which results in 176 clock cycles.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, we advised GCC to compile with the -03 option, which aggressively optimizes the code for speed, e.g. by loop-unrolling.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-misc-2" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Size optimized implementation</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For a size optimized implementation it is wise to compute the round keys on-the-fly, <em>i.e.</em> no key is pre-computed. On the one hand this significantly increases the execution time, but on the other hand also significantly decreases storage requirements. For profile I (encryption only) we chose this option, but for profile II (decryption only) things are different. For decryption first the last round key has to computed with the regular key schedule using the regular S-box S. The last round key then can be used to calculate the round keys backwards for which the  <span class="math">S^{-1}</span>  S-box is required. Hence, for decryption an on-the-fly key schedule would require to implement the regular key schedule and its inverse. Furthermore both S-boxes S and  <span class="math">S^{-1}</span>  have to be stored. Our implementation results of both variants revealed that the pre-computation approach yields smaller program code (948 B) compared to the on-the-fly variant (1022 B). Therefore we implemented profile II with key pre-computation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The 61 bit left rotation of the key schedule now is implemented in a FOR loop, while the counter XOR and the S-box look-up are identical to the speed optimized version. The XOR between a round key byte and the appropriate state byte is implemented in a loop.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For size optimization we chose to implement the S-box as a byte array of 16 entries. The output of this S4&times;<sup>8</sup> called S-box is given by the output value of the PRESENT S-box (lower nibble) with the higher nibble padded with 0x0:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$S_{4\\times8}(x) = 0x0||S(x).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The S-box look-up of all eight state bytes is realized in a loop for both the encryption and the decryption routine.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the size optimized version we resigned to use assembly code. Instead we used the arithmetic representation of the permutation layer P(i) and its inverse P &minus;1 (i) as it was described in Section 4.3.3:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$P(i) = \\begin{cases} i \\cdot 16 \\mod 63, &amp; i \\in \\{0, \\dots, 62\\} \\\\ 63, &amp; i = 63. \\end{cases}</span>$
(5.1)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$P^{-1}(i) = \\begin{cases} i \\cdot 4 \\mod 63, &amp; i \\in \\{0, \\dots, 62\\} \\\\ 63, &amp; i = 63. \\end{cases}</span>$
(5.2)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We used a loop to permute all bits of the state according to Equations 5.1 and 5.2. Finally, we advised GCC to compile with the -Os option, which aggressively optimizes the code for minimal size, e.g. by not unrolling any loop.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-misc-3" class="text-2xl font-bold"><strong>Performance results</strong></h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 5.10 summarizes our implementation results and provides details about all implemented profiles. We compare the implementation results of profile V (speed optimized implementation of encryption and decryption) to other software implementations in Table 5.11. As one can see, our PRESENT-80 implementation is about 11% faster than the one published in [68] but still significantly slower than the AES or IDEA implementation from the same publication. Also the code size of our implementation is larger than the code size of PRESENT and IDEA but smaller than AES.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We chose the <em>Infineon C167CR</em> microcontroller as the target 16-bit platform [111] due to its widespread usage in the embedded systems community.

The C167 architecture combines design elements of RISC as well CISC features and consists of 32 KB to 128 KB mask-programmable ROM, 2 KB of internal RAM (IRAM) and 2 KB extension RAM (XRAM). All memories (as well as the I/O ports) share the same address space, therefore the C167 microcontroller has a <em>Von Neumann</em> memory architecture.

</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 5.12: Architecture of the C166 microcontroller, source: [111].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">special function registers (SFR), a separate multiply and dive unit and a barrel shifter. In conjunction with its four stage instruction pipeline this allows to execute most of the instructions within one clock cycle. It is noteworthy that&mdash;independent of the shifting amount&mdash;all shift and rotate instructions can be executed in one machine cycle. The C167CR requires a voltage supply between 4.5 V and 5.5V and its maximum operating frequency is between 25 MHz and 33 MHz. Its current consumption depends on the operating frequency and can be calculated for active (IDD) and for idle (IID) mode by the following equations:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$I_{DD} = 15 + 2.5 \\cdot f</span>$
<span class="math">$I_{ID} = 10 + f</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where f denotes the frequency in MHz. In power down mode the current consumption is IP D = 50&micro;A. The interested reader is referred to the data sheet [111] and the instruction set manual [108] for further details about the C167 microcontroller.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We used <em>Altiums Tasking VX-Toolset v2.2r3</em> [3], which is integrated into the Eclipse framework [222]. It features a debugger (Crossview Pro) and a high speed simulator for C/C++, assembly and mixed code. There are four optimization levels available:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Level 0</strong> no optimization,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Level 1</strong> optimize without affecting debug-ability,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Level 2</strong> optimize, this is the default level and</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Level 3</strong> maximum optimization.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">There are different memory models: near, far, (segmented) huge and huge. Out of these alternatives the near memory model results in the fastest code, because it does not access Flash memory, while the far memory model yields the smallest code.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-misc-4" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8"><strong>Speed optimized implementation</strong></h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The state is stored as a long long variable that has 64 bits. Since the key has 80 bits, it has to be stored as two long long variable keyhigh and keylow. Though it would have been possible to use a variable type with just 16 bits, we decided to use the long long variable, because this is advantageous for the 61 bit rotation of the key schedule. The S-box of the key schedule S4&times;<sup>64</sup> is realized as a look-up table with 16 entries, each of which is 64 bits wide. The S-box output is the most significant nibble, while the remainder of the output is padded with zeros, <em>i.e.</em></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$S_{4\\times64}(x) = S(x)||0x000000000000000000000000000000000</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For speed optimization we have implemented PRESENT-80 with key pre-computation. For profiles I (encryption only) and V (encryption and decryption) we merged the S-layer and the P-layer into a single look-up. For this purpose the divide-and-conquer approach (see Section 5.4.3) has been applied and 8 new look-up tables have been computed. Since each table outputs 64 bits the memory requirement for the merged S/P-layer is 8 &middot; 2 8 &middot; 64 = 16K bytes. The look-up values are concatenated by an OR operation. For profile III (decryption only) however it is not possible to merge the inverse S-layer and the inverse P-layer, due to the reverse execution order.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-misc-5" class="text-2xl font-bold"><strong>Size optimized implementation</strong></h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For size optimization it is wise to use on-the-fly key scheduling in order to save memory of the round keys. We use on-the-fly key scheduling for profiles II and VI, while for profile IV we use pre-computation (see Section 5.4.3). Since we operate on 64 bit variables (long long) the 61 bit left rotation can be performed within one instruction. Another difference compared to the speed optimized version is the usage of a 4 &times; 16 S-box S4&times;<sup>16</sup> which in this case gives the following output:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$S_{4\\times 16}(x) = 0x000||S(x).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">S4&times;<sup>16</sup> is used both for the key schedule as well a for the data path of the size optimized version, hence the P-layer has to be implemented separately.

    <h3 id="sec-misc-7" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8"><strong>Target platform and development environment</strong></h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We used <em>Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Professional Edition</em> [155] as the integrated development environment. Visual Studio features a compiler and a debugger as well as outstanding documentation by the MSDN library. The compiler has several optimization goals, which are bundled to two options: O1 for minimal size and O2 for maximum speed. The implementation was done on a laptop PC equipped with 512 MB RAM and an <em>Intel Pentium III M</em> processor, clocked at 1, 600 MHz.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-misc-8" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>Speed optimized implementation</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Similar to the speed optimized 16-bit implementations (profiles I, III, V, see Section 5.4.4) we stored the 80-bit key in two 64-bit variables (__int64) in order to exploit performance benefits in the 61-bit key schedule rotation. Also similar to the 16-bit implementations, the S-box in the key schedule is realized as a 4&times;16 S-box with 64-bit output values that consist of the S-box lookup value which is padded with 15 zeros to the right, <em>i.e.</em> S4&times;64(x) = S(x)||0x000000000000000. The S-box and permutation of the datapath have been merged and the divide-and-conquer approach has been applied with k = 8 (see Section 5.4.3) for profiles I and V. As we have pointed out for the 16-bit implementation (see Section 5.4.4) it is not possible to merge S-box and permutation for the decryption routine. For the 32-bit implementation however it is possible to exploit an interesting property of the permutation layer. As described in Section 4.7 it is possible to re-arrange the S-boxes of the datapath such that the permutation layer actually consists of four instances of a permutation layer P16(x) that permutes only 16 bits (see Figure 4.6(b)). Now it is possible to merge 4 adjacent S-boxes and one instance of the reduced permutation layer (see Figure 5.13) into a new look-up table SP16&times;<sup>16</sup> = P16(S(x)||S(x)||S(x)||S(x)). SP<sup>16</sup> has 2 <sup>16</sup> 64-bit entries. As one can see, the major benefit is that the expensive permutation layer P (or better P 0 ) now only every second round has to be processed, which leads to an estimated clock cycle reduction of 25%. However, since every second round key has to be re-ordered as</p>

</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 5.13: Re-ordering and merging of S-boxes with the permutation layer.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">well, the saving is less. Figure 5.13 depicts details of the re-ordering and the merging of the S-boxes with the permutation layer.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, we advised the compiler to use the /O2 option for the speed optimized profiles I, III and V.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-misc-9" class="text-2xl font-bold"><strong>Size optimized implementation</strong></h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For profiles II, IV and VI we implemented the key schedule similar to the 16-bit size optimized implementation. However, since we operate on 64-bit variables (__int64) we use the 4 &times; 64 S-box S4&times;<sup>64</sup> which was introduced above. The permutation layer was implemented using the arithmetic description (see Section 4.3.3). Furthermore we advised the compiler to use the /O1 option for the code size optimized profiles II, IV and VI.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-misc-10" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8"><strong>Performance results</strong></h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 5.13 summarizes the implementation results of all variants for the 32-bit <em>Pentium III</em>. We derived the memory requirements from the file size of the assembly file which is created by the compiler. For each profile we measured 100, 000 times the required clock cycles with the RDTSC command. Out of the 100, 000 values we chose the minimum to keep external influences of the PC (such as network card activity etc.) to a minimum.</p>

He also implemented a GUI based implementation of PRESENT in <em>Microsoft Silverlight</em> for educational purposes. Figure 5.14 depicts selected screenshots of his implementation. Oosterlynck implemented PRESENT in <em>Python</em>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 5.14: Screenshots of selected implementations of PRESENT.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this Chapter we have explored implementations of PRESENT on a wide variety of different platforms, ranging from ASICs and FPGAs, over hardware-software co-design approaches to plain software implementations. The serialized ASIC implementation constitutes with 1, 000 GE the smallest published ASIC implementation of a cryptographic algorithm with a reasonable security level. Also the FPGA-implementation leads to a very compact result (202 slices), while providing a maximum frequency of 254 MHz. ASIC and FPGA figures highlight that though PRESENT was designed with a minimal hardware footprint in mind, <em>i.e.</em> targeted for low-cost devices such as RFIDs, PRESENT is also well suited for high-speed and highthroughput applications. Especially its hardware efficiency, <em>i.e.</em> the throughput per slice or GE, respectively, is noteworthy. Furthermore, interestingly the old-fashioned Boolean minimization tool <em>espresso</em> lead to an FPGA implementation that was significantly smaller than a standard LUT based implementation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If we only consider crypto cores in a HW/SW co-design environment, the energy consumption of PRESENT seems to be not so promising compared to the AES. However, if we also take the I/O commuication overhead between the microcontroller and the co-processor into account, PRESENT is more energy efficient and also the power and area (7 <em>times</em> smaller) requirements of PRESENT are very low compared to the AES. Together with the gained speed-up factor of 44.6 for a HW/SW co-design approach compared to a plain software implementation, these figures underline PRESENTs suitability for low-area and low-cost hardware implementations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">On the software side we exploited the lightweight structure of PRESENT and especially its 4-bit S-boxes by implementing PRESENT on a 4-bit microcontroller. Due to the low-power nature of the ATAM893-D microcontroller it is also thinkable that 4-bit microcontroller will be employed in low-cost RFID tags. To the best of our knowledge up to now there are no implementation results of cryptographic algorithms for 4-bit microcontrollers published. In this Chapter we have closed this gap and provided the first implementation results of this kind. We therefore presented a proof-of-concept that state-of-the-art cryptography is feasible on ultra-constrained 4-bit microcontrollers. Our implementation draws a current of 6.7&micro;A at a supply voltage of 1.8V and a frequency of 500 KHz. Together with the observation that the processing of one data block requires less than 200 ms we conclude that this implementation is interesting for passively powered RFID tags. In this Chapter we also provided implementation figures for PRESENT with different optimization goals (speed or code size) for 8-, 16- and 32-bit processors. We also showed that the regular structure of the permutation layer of PRESENT can be exploited to obtain a faster implementation by re-ordering the S-boxes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this Chapter lightweight hash functions are investigated. First, the work is motivated in Section 6.1 and related work is treated in Section 6.2. Then our design decisions are presented in Section 6.3 and subsequently information about general hash function constructions are given in Section 6.4. Since current hash functions of dedicated design are either too large or broken, we first consider hash functions that are built around block ciphers. In particular we use the compact block cipher PRESENT (see Sections 4 and 5) as a building block and we consider the implementation of a range of hash functions offering 64-bit (see Section 6.5) and 128-bit outputs (Section 6.6) using established techniques. We also consider hash functions that offer larger outputs and we highlight some design directions along with their potential hardware footprint in Section 6.7. Finally, the Chapter is concluded in Section 6.8. Please note that parts of this chapter are based on joint work with Andrey Bogdanov, Gregor Leander, Christof Paar, Matt Robshaw and Yannick Seurin. Especially the design and security assessment of DM-PRESENT-80, DM-PRESENT-128, H-PRESENT-128 and C-PRESENT-192 contain significant contributions from Matt Robshaw and Yannick Seurin, whereas Andrey Bogdanov and Gregor Leander significantly contributed to the design of PROP-1 and PROP-2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With RFID tags on consumer items, the potential for wired-homes, and large-scale sensor networks becoming a reality, we are on the threshold of a pervasive computing environment. But along with these new applications come new, and demanding, security challenges. The cryptographic research community has been quick to identify some of the issues, and device authentication and privacy have received considerable attention. As a result a variety of new protocols have been proposed and in many of them, particularly ones intended to preserve user privacy and to anonymize tag interactions, it is assumed that a cryptographic hash function will be used on the tag.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, which hash function might be used in practice is rarely identified. Looking at dedicated hash functions from the last 20 years, we have become used to their impressive hashing speed (though this is a view that we might have to change in the future). This fast throughput might lead some designers to believe that hash functions are &quot;efficient&quot; in other regards and that they can be routinely used in low-cost environments. This is a mistake, a point that was convincingly made in a paper by Feldhofer and Rechberger [72]. Generally speaking, current hash functions are not at all suitable for constrained environments. They require significant amounts of state and the operations in current dedicated designs are not hardware friendly. This is not surprising since modern hash functions were designed with 32-bit processors in mind, but it means that very few RFID-oriented protocols appealing to a hash function could ever be used on a modestly-capable tag.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this Chapter we consider RFID tag-enabled applications and the use of hash functions in RFID protocols. We then turn our attention to the design of hash functions and we explore whether a block cipher makes an appropriate starting point for a compact hash function instead of a dedicated design.<sup>1</sup></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Sections 6.5 and 6.6 we instantiate lightweight hash functions using literature-based constructions and the compact block cipher PRESENT [33]. This allows us to implement a range of representative constructions that, for their given parameter sets, are the most compact hash functions available today. In Section 6.7 we then look at some challenging problems in designing hash functions with greater hash output lengths. While the paper reveals positive results, our work also serves to highlight the difficult issue of compact hash functions; we therefore close the paper with problems for future research.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To consider the efficiency of our proposals, we implemented two different architectures, <em>i.e.</em> round-based and serialized, for each proposal in VHDL. We describe these architectures and the implementation results in the corresponding subsection in detail. For functional and postsynthesis simulation we used <em>Mentor Graphics Modelsim SE PLUS 6.3a</em> [92] and <em>Synopsys Design-Compiler</em> version <em>Z-2007.03-SP5</em> [219] was used to synthesize the designs to the <em>Virtual Silicon</em> (VST) standard cell library <em>UMCL18G212T3</em>, which is based on the <em>UMC L180 0.18</em>&micro;<em>m 1P6M</em> logic process and has a typical voltage of 1.8 Volt [233]. We used <em>Synopsys Power Compiler</em> version <em>Z-2007.03-SP5</em> [220] to estimate the power consumption of our implementations. For synthesis and for power estimation we advised the compiler to use a clock frequency of 100 KHz, which is a widely used operating frequency for RFID applications. For the power simulation an appropriate wire-load model was chosen that fits to the size of the actual design. We give details about this in the corresponding subsection.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For RFID tag-based applications, the protocols in question are often focused on authentication or on providing some form of anonymity and/or privacy [5, 14, 61, 77, 100, 142, 176]. These protocols use a cryptographic hash function and it is assumed that these can be efficiently implemented in hardware. However, Feldhofer and Rechberger have pointed out that current hash functions are not all suited for use in hardware constrained environments, because the area and power requirements of standard hash functions, e.g. MD4 [197], MD5 [196], SHA-1 [166] and SHA-256 [166] are too large [72]. In particular, their implementations require 7, 350 GE and 456 cycles for MD4, 8, 400 GE and 612 cycles for MD5, 8, 120 and 1, 274 cycles for SHA-1 and 10, 868 GE and 1, 128 cycles for SHA-256. This is far away from the 2, 000 GE barrier and so they identified the design of new lightweight hash functions as future work.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A new lightweight compression function named <em>MAME</em> was proposed by Yoshida <em>et al.</em> at CHES 2007 [95]. Though their hardware implementation requires only 96 clock cycles, the area requirement remains still too large with 8, 100 GE. At FSE 2008 Shamir proposed a new MAC named <em>SQUASH</em> that is tailored for RFID tags [207]. There have been no ASIC implementations published so far, but Gosset <em>et al.</em> have assessed the hardware efficiency of SQUASH on a Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA device [90]. Their area optimized implementation of SQUASH with an output size of 32 bits requires 63, 250 clock cycles and 377 slices and 104, 114 clock cycles and 378 slices for a 64-bit output variant. These figures are translated into 6, 303 GE and 6, 328 GE, respectively, by the synthesis tool <em>Xilinx ISE</em>. Please note that the amount of GE derived from a number of slices is typically significantly larger than a plain ASIC implementation would</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>1</sup>This relates to proposals for future work identified in [72].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">require and also depends on the target device. Consequently Gosset <em>et al.</em> proposed to see their results as an upper bound.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Recent attacks on standard hash functions [236, 237] have triggered a public competition for a new hash algorithm by NIST [165]. However, since the aim is to design a general purpose hash algorithm, it is no wonder that the requirements do not fit well for constrained environments such as passive RFID tags. Especially the digest sizes of 224- to 512-bit will most probably lead to high area requirements for any candidates.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Informally, a cryptographic hash function H takes an input of variable size and returns a hash value of fixed length while satisfying the properties of preimage resistance, second preimage resistance, and collision resistance [153]. For a hash function with n-bit output, compromising these should require 2 n , 2 n , and 2 n/<sup>2</sup> operations respectively. These properties make hash functions very appealing in a range of protocols. For tag-based applications, the protocols in question are often focused on authentication or on providing some form of anonymity and/or privacy [5, 14, 61, 77, 100, 142, 176]. However, some estimates suggest that no more than 2, 000 GE are available for security in low-cost RFID tags [116] but implementation results show that the hash functions available are unsuitable in practice [72]. When we consider what we need from a hash function in an RFID tag-based application the following issues can be identified:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>(1) In tag-based applications we are unlikely to hash large amounts of data. Most tag protocols require that the hash function processes a challenge, an identifier, and/or perhaps a counter. The typical input is usually much less than 256 bits.</li>
      <li>(2) In many tag-based applications we do not need the property of <em>collision resistance</em>. Most often the security of the protocol depends on the <em>one-way</em> property. In certain situations, therefore, it is safe to use hash functions with smaller hash outputs.</li>
      <li>(3) Applications will (typically) only require moderate security levels. Consequently 80-bit security, or even less, may be adequate. This is also the position taken in the eSTREAM project [175]. An algorithm should be chosen according to the relevant security level and in deployment, where success depends on every dollar and cent spent, there is no point using extra space to get a 256-bit security level if 64-bit security is all that is required.</li>
      <li>(4) While the physical space for an implementation is often the primary consideration, the peak and average power consumption are also important. The time for a computation will matter if we consider how a tag interacts with higher-level communication and anticollision protocols.</li>
      <li>(5) Some protocols use a hash function to build a <em>message authentication code</em> (MAC), often by appealing to the HMAC construction [164]. When used as a MAC a number of interesting issues arise such as choosing an appropriate key length and understanding whether keys will be changed, something that will almost certainly be impossible in most tag-enabled applications. There might also be the possibility of side-channel analysis on the MAC. However, such attacks will rarely be worthwhile for cheap tag-enabled applications and we do not consider this issue further.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Taking account of these considerations allows us to make some pragmatic choices. There will be applications that just require one-wayness and the application may only require 80-bit or 64-bit security. Note that this is the view adopted by Shamir in the proposal SQUASH for use in RFID tags [207]. For other applications we might like to see 80-bit security against collision attacks.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Hash functions in use today are built around the use of a <em>compression function</em> and appeal to the theoretical foundations laid down by Merkle and Damg&aring;rd [55, 154]. The compression function h has a fixed-length input, consisting of a <em>chaining variable</em> and a message extract, and gives a fixed-length output. A variety of results [58, 114, 118] have helped provide a greater understanding of this construction and while there are some limitations there are some countermeasures [24]. Since our goal is to obtain <em>representative</em> performance estimates, we will not go into the details of hash function designs. Instead we will assume that our hash function uses a compression function in an appropriate way and that the compression function takes as input some words of chaining variable, represented by H<sup>i</sup> , and some words of (formatted) message extract, represented by M<sup>i</sup> . We then restrict our focus to the cost of implementing the compression function.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the hash function literature it is common to distinguish between two popular ways of building a compression function. The first is to use a compression function of a dedicated design and the second is to use an established, and trusted, block cipher.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-6.4.1" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>6.4.1 Dedicated hash function constructions</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The separation of dedicated constructions from block cipher-based constructions tends to disguise the fact that even dedicated hash functions like SHA-1 [163] and MD5 [196] are themselves built around a block cipher. Remove the feed-forward from compression functions in the MD-family and we are left with a reversible component that can be used as a block cipher (such as SHACAL [98] in the case of SHA-1). However, the underlying block cipher we are left with is rather strange and has a much larger-than-normal block and key size combination. The problem with dedicated hash functions is that recent attacks [236, 237] have shown that there is much to learn in designing block ciphers with such strange parameter sizes. There is therefore some value in considering approaches that use a more &quot;classical&quot; block cipher as the basis for a compression function.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-6.4.2" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>6.4.2 Block cipher constructions</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The use of a block cipher as a building block in hash function design [49] is as old as DES [159]. The topic has been recently revisited and Black <em>et al.</em> [30] have built on the work of Preneel [187] to present a range of secure 2n- to n-bit compression functions built around an n-bit block cipher that takes an n-bit key. Among these are the well-known <em>Davies-Meyer</em>, <em>Matyas-Meyer-Oseas</em>, and <em>Miyaguchi-Preneel</em> constructions.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A hash function with an output of n bits can only offer a security level of 2 <sup>n</sup> operations for pre-image and second pre-image attacks and 2 n/<sup>2</sup> operations against finding collisions. While a security level of 128-bit is typical for mainstream applications, 80-bit security is often a reasonable target for RFID tag-based applications. Either way, there is a problem since the hash functions we need cannot always be immediately constructed out of the block ciphers we have to hand. This is not a new problem. But it is not an easy one to solve either, and there has been mixed success in constructing 2n-bit hash functions from an n-bit block cipher [36, 49, 129, 136, 137, 188, 189]. While limitations have been identified in many constructions, work by Hirose [103, 105] has identified a family of double-block-length hash functions that possess a proof of security. These use block ciphers with a key length that is twice the block length. Such a property is shared by AES-256 [161] and PRESENT-128 [33] and so in Section 6.6 we consider the performance of an Hirose-style construction instantiated using PRESENT-128.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">When it comes to providing a replacement for SHA-1, the parameter sizes involved provide a difficult challenge. If we are to use a 64-bit block cipher like PRESENT-128, then in arriving at a hash function with an output of at least 160 bits we need a construction that delivers an output three times the block size (thereby achieving a 192-bit hash function). There are no &quot;classical&quot; constructions for this and so Sections 6.7.1 and 6.7.3 illustrate two possible design directions. These give representative constructions and we use them to gauge the hardware requirements of different design approaches. We hope that this will be of interest to future hash function designers.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we will consider two approaches to compact hashing with a digest size of 64 bits when we use the block cipher PRESENT [33] as a building block. We start with the description and security analysis of DM-PRESENT-80 and DM-PRESENT-128 in Section 6.5.1. Subsequently, we describe different implementation results of both proposals in Section 6.5.2 (DM-PRESENT-80) and Section 6.5.3 (DM-PRESENT-128).</p>

      <h4 id="sec-6.5.1" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>6.5.1 Description of DM-PRESENT-80 and DM-PRESENT-128</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">There are a variety of choices for building a 64-bit hash function from a 64-bit block cipher. We will illustrate these with the <em>Davies-Meyer</em> mode where a single 64-bit chaining variable  <span class="math">H_i</span>  is updated using a message extract  <span class="math">M_i</span>  according to the computation  <span class="math">H&#x27;_i = E(H_i, M) \\oplus H_i</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In our case E denotes encryption with either PRESENT-80 or PRESENT-128, see Figure 6.1. Such hash functions will only be of use in applications that require the one-way property and 64-bit security. At each iteration of the compression function 64 bits of chaining variable and 80 bits (resp. 128 bits) of message-related input are compressed. Therefore the two proposals DM-PRESENT-80 and DM-PRESENT-128 provide a simple trade-off between space and throughput. We also provide figures for a serial and parallel implementation of PRESENT, see Table 6.5.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">While we have focused on using Davies-Meyer, it is important to note that these figures are a good indication of the cost for <em>any</em> single block-length hash function construction. If one prefers to implement <em>Matyas-Meyer-Oseas</em> or <em>Miyaguchi-Preneel</em> based on PRESENT (instead of <em>Davies-Meyer</em>) then the cost of DM-PRESENT-80 will be a reasonable guide. Moving away from PRESENT to a different block cipher will almost certainly cause an increase to the space required for an implementation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;2</sup>These properties are identical to those offered by the proposal SQUASH [207].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We first describe the round-based implementation DM-PRESENT-80/64 with a 64-bit datapath and then subsequently the serialized implementation DM-PRESENT-80/4 with a 4-bit datapath.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-misc-11" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8"><strong>Implementation results of</strong> DM-PRESENT-80 <strong>with a</strong> 64<strong>-bit datapath</strong></h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 6.3 depicts the architecture of the DM-PRESENT-80 module with a datapath of 64 bits and its input and output signals are depicted in Figure 6.2(a). As one can see this architecture consists of the 64-bit gated register Temp, a finite state machine (FSM), a 64-bit XOR and a round-based PRESENT-80 implementation. The latter one contains a 64-bit and an 80-bit register, a 64-bit XOR, 17 S-boxes (16 in the datapath and one in the key schedule), the P-Layer and a 61-bit rotation and the 5-bit counter XOR in the key schedule.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We used the finite state machine (FSM) depicted in Figure 6.2(b) to control our implementation of DM-PRESENT-80 with a datapath of 64 bits. As can be seen the FSM consists of the six states S_IDLE, S_INIT_TEMP, S_INIT_DATA, S_PRESENT, S_H_UPDATE, and S_DONE. Upon resetting the ASIC the FSM starts in the S_IDLE state. The following two states S_INIT_TEMP and S_INIT_DATA both last for one clock cycle and do not have a condition for transition, <em>i.e.</em> after one clock cycle the FSM transitions to the following state. During the S_INIT_TEMP state the initial chaining variable H is loaded into the Temp register and during the S_INIT_DATA state it is forwarded to the State register. The S_PRESENT state lasts for 31 cycles, during which a complete PRESENT encryption is performed. After the encryption the FSM transitons to the S_H_UPDATE state, where the result of the PRESENT encryption is XORed with the chainig variable H and the result is stored in the Temp register. This takes one clock cycle and if all message chunks are processed the FSM transitions to the S_DONE state, otherwise to the S_INIT_DATA state. During the S_DONE state the done signal is active indicating that the correct result is ready.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It takes 33 clock cycles to process one message chunk of 80 bits. At a frequency of 100 KHz this is equivalent to a throughput of 242.42 Kbps. After synthesis our implementation requires</p>

The hardware efficiency is 109.5 bps/GE.

    <p class="text-gray-300">The architecture of a serialized implementation with a datapath of 4 bits is depicted in Figure 6.4 and its input and output signals are shown in Figure 6.5(a). This architecture comprises of a gated register Temp with 4- and 64-bit inputs and outputs, a 4-bit XOR, a 4-bit MUX, and a serialized PRESENT-80 implementation. The latter one consists of a gated register with 4 and 64-bit input and output, one gated register with 4- and 80-bit input and output, two 4-bit MUXes, a 4-bit XOR, two S-boxes (each one for the datapath and the key schedule), the P-Layer, a 61-bit rotation, the 5-bit counter XOR in the key schedule and a finite state machine (FSM). Please note that this serialized PRESENT-80 implementation is similar to the one described in Section 5.1.1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We used the finite state machine (FSM) depicted in Figure 6.5(b) to control our implementation of DM-PRESENT-80/4. As can be seen the FSM consists of the seven states S_IDLE, S_INIT_DATA, S_INIT_KS, S_SBOX, S_PLAYER_KS, S_FINISHED, and S_DONE. Upon resetting the ASIC the FSM starts in the S_IDLE state and transistions after one clock cycle into the next state S_INIT_DATA. During each of the next 16 cycles a 4-bit chunk of the 64-bit chaining variable H is loaded into both the Temp and the State register. At the same time also the 64 MSB of the 80-bit message M are loaded into the Key register. Then the FSM transitions to the S_INIT_KS state, which loads the remaining 16 bits of the message M into the Key register. Thus it takes another 4 clock cycles before the FSM transitions to the next state S_SBOX. During each of the 16 cycles of this state, a 4-bit chunk of the state is XORed with a 4-bit chunk of the roundkey, and then subsequently processed by the S-box. Once all 64 bits are processed, the FSM transitions to the S_PLAYER_KS state. During this state the whole State is permuted by the P-layer, and the Key register is updated with the new roundkey within one clock cycle. Since PRESENT features 31 complete rounds (<em>i.e.</em> a round consisting of key XOR, S-box lookup and permutation), the FSM returns back to the S_SBOX state 31 times. At the</p>

Within each of its 16 clock cycles it computes both the final round of PRESENT and then the XOR addition of the chaining variable H and the output of PRESENT, 4 bits at a time. Also the done signal is set to 1 to indicate that the result is output. Finally, the FSM transitions to the S_DONE state in order to set the done signal to 0.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It takes 547 clock cycles to process one message chunk of 80 bits. At a frequency of 100 KHz this is equivalent to a throughput of 14.63 Kbps. After synthesis our implementation requires 1,600 GE. Unfortunately a detailed breakdown of its components is not possible in this case, because the synthesis result does not provide the required information. However, our serialized architecture of DM-PRESENT-80 consists of a serialized PRESENT-80 (1,075 GE), as described in Section 5.1.1), the Temp register (384 GE), a 4-bit MUX (9 GE), and a 4-bit XOR (11 GE), which sums up to 1,479 GE. The missing 121 GE may be required by the more complex FSM. The hardware efficiency is 9.1 bps/GE. At a clock frequency of 100 KHz and with the suggested wire-load model of 10,000 GE DM-PRESENT-80/4 consumes 1.83  <span class="math">\\mu</span> W which is equivalent to 1.02  <span class="math">\\mu</span> A.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 6.7 depicts the architecture of the DM-PRESENT-128 module with a datapath of 64 bits and its input and output signals are depicted in Figure 6.6. Similar to the DM-PRESENT-80 implementation with a 64 bits datapath it contains a 64-bit gated register Temp, a finite state machine (FSM) and a 64 bit XOR. The main difference lies in the round-based PRESENTimplementation, which in this case is PRESENT-128 and not PRESENT-80. It consists of a 64-bit and a 128-bit register, a 64-bit XOR, 18 S-boxes (16 in the datapath and two in the key schedule), the P-Layer and a 61-bit rotation and the 5-bit counter XOR in the key schedule.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We used the same finite state machine (FSM) as for DM-PRESENT-80/64 (see Figure 6.2(b)) and refer to the description above for further details. Similar to the DM-PRESENT-80/64 implementation it also takes 33 clock cycles to process one message chunk. Contrary to the DM-PRESENT-80/64 implementation one message chunk now has 128 bits instead of 80 bits. Therefore the throughput at a frequency of 100 KHz is a factor of  <span class="math">\\frac{128}{80} = 1.6 \\text{ higher}</span>  and now achieves 387.88</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We used a slightly modified version of the finite state machine (FSM) for DM-PRESENT-80/4 to control our implementation of DM-PRESENT-128/4, see Figure 6.10. As can be seen, the FSM consists of the same seven states, <em>i.e.</em> S_IDLE, S_INIT_DATA, S_INIT_KS, S_SBOX, S_PLAYER_KS, S_FINISHED, and S_DONE. The only difference occurs during the S_INIT_KS state. Since now PRESENT with a 128-bit key is used, it requires 12 more cycles to load the whole key into the Key register. Therefore the FSM transitions after 16 clock cycles to the next state and not after just four clock cycles. The remainder of the FSM is identical and we refer to the description above for more details.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">When designing a 128-bit hash function from the 64-bit output block cipher PRESENT, we have to appeal to so-called double-block-length hash function constructions.

These schemes possess security proofs in the ideal cipher model, where the underlying block cipher is modeled as a family of random permutations, one permutation being chosen independently for each key. However, MDC-2 is not an ideal construction [214] and so we base our 128-bit hash function H-PRESENT-128 on the construction studied in [105]. We start with a description and security ananlysis of our proposal H-PRESENT-128 in Section 6.6.1. Subsequently, we present different implementation results for the proposal in Section 6.6.2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The scheme H-PRESENT-128 is illustrated in Figure 6.11. The compression function takes as input two 64-bit chaining variables and a 64-bit message extract, denoted by the triple  <span class="math">(H_1, H_2, M)</span> , and outputs the pair of updated chaining variables  <span class="math">(H_1&#x27;, H_2&#x27;)</span>  according to the computation</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$H_1&#x27; = E_{H_2 \\parallel M}(H_1) \\oplus H_1</span>$
and  <span class="math">H_2&#x27; = E_{H_2 \\parallel M}(H_1 \\oplus c) \\oplus H_1</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where E denotes PRESENT-128 and c is a non-zero constant that needs to be fixed [40]. Thus the chaining variable  <span class="math">H_1 \\parallel H_2</span>  is 128 bits long and 64 bits of message-related input are hashed per iteration.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Hirose showed that, in the ideal cipher model, an adversary has to make at least  <span class="math">2^n</span>  queries to the cipher in order to find a collision with non-negligible advantage, where n is the block size of the cipher. It is possible to make the same kind of analysis for preimage resistance (see proof of Theorem 4 in [104]) and to show that any adversary has to make at least  <span class="math">2^{2n}</span>  queries to the cipher to find a preimage. As for Section 6.5 our implementation results are presented for both a parallel and serial implementation of PRESENT-128, see Table 6.5. These results should be viewed as indicative of the cost of a double-block-length construction using PRESENT. Since only one key schedule needs to be computed per iteration of the compression function, the Hirose construction is probably one of the most efficient constructions of this type, e.g. in the case of PRESENT around 1,000 GE can be saved in this way.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 6.13 depicts the architecture of the round-based H-PRESENT-128 implementation with a datapath of 128 bits. The H-PRESENT-128/128 implementation consists of a gated register with 64-bit input and output for the chaining variable (384 GE), two 64-bit MUXes (298 GE), two 64-bit XOR gates (342 GE), a finite state machine, a modified PRESENT-128 core and an additional PRESENT data path (1, 000 GE). Note that since the constant c was chosen as 0x00000000 00000001, the XOR with the constant is actually only a NOT gate, which requires 0.5 GE.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We used the finite state machine (FSM) depicted in Figure 6.12(b) to control our implementation of H-PRESENT-128/128. As can be seen, the FSM consists of the three states S_IDLE, S_INIT and S_PRESENT. Upon resetting the ASIC the FSM starts in the S_IDLE state. During the following state S_INIT the chaining variable h<sup>1</sup> is stored in the Temp register. In the same clock cycle also the second chaining variable h<sup>2</sup> and the first message chunk M are concatenated and loaded into the Key register. The FSM directly transitions without any condition</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It takes 32 clock cycles to process one message chunk of 64 bits. At a frequency of 100 KHz this is equivalent to a throughput of 200 Kbps. After synthesis our implementation requires 4, 256 GE and a breakdown of its components is given in Table 6.3. As one can see more than half of the area is required for storage of the state (56.4 %). The hardware efficiency is 109.5 bps/GE.

    <h4 id="sec-misc-16" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Implementation results of H-PRESENT-128 with an 8-bit datapath</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 6.14 depicts the architecture of the serialized H-PRESENT-128 implementation with a datapath of 8 bits. The H-PRESENT-128/8 implementation basically consists of the DM-PRESENT-128/4 implementation (1,886 GE, see above for details) with some additional logic. In particular this is a gated register with 4-bit and 64-bit input and output for the second PRESENT state (384 GE), two 4-bit MUXes (20 GE), two 4-bit XOR gates (22 GE)<sup>3</sup> and an additional 4-bit MUX for the S-box input (10 GE).<sup>4</sup></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We used the same finite state machine (FSM) as for DM-PRESENT-128/4 (see Figure 6.10) to control our implementation of H-PRESENT-128/8, hence we refer to the description above for</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;3</sup>Because the roundkey is XORed to both PRESENT states and both results are then XORed with the chaining variable. Therefore, H-PRESENT-128/8 requires two 8-bit XORes and not two 4-bit XORes as DM-PRESENT-128/4.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;4</sup>H-PRESENT-128/8 has two serialized PRESENT datapathes, hence 8 bits are processed by the S-boxes, while DM-PRESENT-128/4 has only one PRESENT datapath, hence only 4 bits are processed at once. Since in both architectures the S-boxes are also used by the key schedule the input has to be multiplexed.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">more details. It takes 559 clock cycles to process one data chunk of 64 bits. Since DM-PRESENT-128/4 processes data chunks of 128 bits while requiring the same amount of clock cycles, H-PRESENT-128/8 gains exactly half of its throughput, <em>i.e.</em> 11.45 Kbps at a frequency of 100 KHz. After synthesis our implementation requires 2,330 GE. Again for this architecture a detailed breakdown of its components is not possible. The hardware efficiency is 4.9 bps/GE. At a frequency of 100 KHz and with the suggested wire-load model of 10,000 GE H-PRESENT-128/8 has an average power consumption of 6.44  <span class="math">\\mu</span> W, which relates to an average current consumption of 3.58  <span class="math">\\mu</span> A.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In some cases tag-enabled applications might need collision-resistance at a security level of  <span class="math">2^{80}</span>  operations. For this we need a hash output of 160 bits or greater. However, this is where the problems really begin and we consider two directions.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the first, we continue the approach to consider building a hash function with a hash output greater than 160 bits from PRESENT as is. So in Section 6.7.1 we try to use PRESENT in this way and, using established results in the literature, we make a proposal. However, at the same time, we use the very same results to demonstrate that this approach is unlikely to be successful, a sentiment that is supported by our implementation results in Section 6.7.2. Instead, for the second direction that is described in Section 6.7.3, we move towards a dedicated hash function though we keep elements of PRESENT in our constructions. Our dedicated proposals are deliberately simple and obvious, and in this way we aim to provide some first results on the impact different design choices might have in moving towards a new, compact, hash function.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-6.7.1" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>6.7.1 Description of</strong> C-PRESENT-192</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We aim to design a hash function that is based on PRESENT and has a digest size of at least 160 bits. Since PRESENT has a 64-bit block size, this means that we are forced to consider a triple-block-length construction and we will obtain a 192-bit hash function. Unfortunately very few designs for l-block length hash function with  <span class="math">l \\geq 3</span>  have been studied so far. However, Peyrin et al. [179] have identified some necessary conditions for securely combining compression functions to obtain a new compression function with a longer output. We can use these results and so, in the case we consider here, our constituent compression functions will be based around PRESENT-128, i.e. we will use DM-PRESENT-128 as the building block.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">More background to the construction framework is given in [179]. However, within this framework, efficiency demands that we keep to a minimum the number of compression functions that we need to use, where each compression function is instantiated by DM-PRESENT-128. For reasons of simplicity and greater design flexibility we restrict ourselves to processing only a single 64-bit message extract, and so our inputs to C-PRESENT-192, where we use C as shorthand for &quot;constructed&quot;, consist of a quadruplet  <span class="math">(H_1, H_2, H_3, M)</span>  while the output is a triplet  <span class="math">(H_1&#x27;, H_2&#x27;, H_3&#x27;)</span> . The compression function C-PRESENT-192 is illustrated in Figure 6.16. The output is computed as:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$H&#x27;_1 = f^{(1)}(H_3, H_1, H_2) \\oplus f^{(3)}(H_3 \\oplus M, H_1, H_2) \\oplus f^{(5)}(H_2, H_3, M)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">H&#x27;_2 = f^{(1)}(H_3, H_1, H_2) \\oplus f^{(4)}(H_1, H_3, M) \\oplus f^{(6)}(H_1 \\oplus H_2, H_3, M)</span>
<span class="math">H&#x27;_3 = f^{(2)}(M, H_1, H_2) \\oplus f^{(4)}(H_1, H_3, M) \\oplus f^{(5)}(H_2, H_3, M)</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Each inner compression function f (i) is built around PRESENT-128 in Davies-Meyer mode, and five non-zero constants c1, . . . , c<sup>5</sup> are used to make them independent. The constants were chosen to be linearly independent and of low Hamming weight.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We chose the constants c<sup>0</sup> to c<sup>5</sup> according to the following equation</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$c_i = \\begin{cases} 0, i = 0 \\\\ c_i = 2^{i-1}, 1 \\le i \\le 5. \\end{cases}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In other words we used the constants c<sup>0</sup> = 0 = 000002, c<sup>1</sup> = 1 = 000012, c<sup>2</sup> = 2 = 000102, c<sup>3</sup> = 4 = 001002, c<sup>4</sup> = 8 = 010002, c<sup>5</sup> = 16 = 100002. In a more computer architecture oriented description the non-zero constants c1, . . . , c<sup>5</sup> are given by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$c_i = (0x0000000000000001) \\ll (i-1).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This construction might seem too complicated, but this is exactly the point we wish to make. The particular set of parameter values that are forced upon us when trying to build a largeoutput hash function from a small block cipher means that there will be <em>no</em> simple construction. More precisely, work in [179] shows that for <em>any</em> construction that uses a compression function with parameters equivalent to PRESENT-128 along with linear mixing layers to combine chaining variables and intermediate values, at least six compression functions are needed to resist all currently-known generic attacks. We <em>must</em> therefore use at least six independent calls to DM-PRESENT-128, which is attained by our C-PRESENT-192 construction.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In addition, the output mapping should be a (6, 3, 3) binary linear error-correcting code, while the input mapping must satisfy the following constraints:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>(1) Every external output block must depend on all external input blocks, no matter which invertible transformation of the external inputs and outputs is applied.</li>
      <li>(2) Every pair of external input blocks must appear as an identified pair for every invertible combination of external output blocks, where a pair (A, B) is said to be identified when A and B both appear within the internal inputs to some f (i) , and this no matter which invertible transformation of the external inputs is applied.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The input mapping for our representative was selected from among those that satisfy these conditions and that also minimize the number of key schedules used to hash one block of message. By reducing the number of key schedules we increase the performance of the scheme and, potentially, reduce the space required by an implementation. It can be proved that for the parameter sets of interest to us here, the minimal number of key schedules is two.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the results of Peyrin <em>et al.</em> [179] to hold, the compression functions f (i) have to be <em>ideal</em> compression functions with respect to collision and preimage resistance (that is, finding a collision or a preimage must require on average &Theta;(2n/<sup>2</sup> ) and &Theta;(2<sup>n</sup> ) evaluations of the function respectively) and must behave independently. Each inner compression function f (i) is built around PRESENT-128 in a way similar to the Davies-Meyer mode. That way, the results of Black <em>et al.</em> [30] ensure that, in the ideal cipher model, finding a collision (resp. a preimage) for the compression functions f (i) requires &Theta;(2n/<sup>2</sup> ) (resp. &Theta;(2<sup>n</sup> )) queries to the cipher. Hence, in the ideal cipher model, each inner compression function f (i) is ideal in the sense defined above.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Making the six compression functions f (i) independent is not so easy. The most secure way to do this would be to &quot;tweak&quot; the block cipher with <em>e.g.</em> the XE or XEX construction of Rogaway [198]. However, these constructions are only efficient when one has to compute ciphertexts for the same key and many different tweaks, which is not our case. Using any known provably secure construction of a tweakable block cipher for the C-PRESENT-192 scheme would imply one supplementary cipher call for each key, thus increasing the number of block cipher calls per message block to eight. Instead we might consider using the same kind of technique that is used in the Hirose construction and we use five constants c1, . . . , c<sup>5</sup> to make the six instances of the compression function independent. In the absence of a structural weakness in PRESENT this is sufficient for our purposes. Further, we are trying to estimate the space required for a construction of this type and so this approach will help to yield conservative estimates. The constants were chosen to be linearly independent and of low Hamming weight. They are given by c<sup>0</sup> = 0 and c<sup>i</sup> = (0x0000000000000001) (i &minus; 1) for i &ge; 1. While some limitations of this construction follow from [205], assuming we can consider the inner compression functions independent, Peyrin <em>et al.</em> show that there is no currently-known attack with <em>computational</em> complexity less than brute-force on the larger compression function.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-6.7.2" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>6.7.2 Implementation results and estimations of</strong> C-PRESENT-192</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">When implementing C-PRESENT-192 in a round-based manner, there is a trade-off between storage of intermediate values and additional PRESENT datapaths. A completely parallelized approach would require six datapaths (6 &times; 840 GE = 5, 040 GE, see Section 5.1) and two key schedules (2 &times; 1, 000 GE = 2, 000 GE, see Section 5.1) of PRESENT-128, eight 64-bit XORs with two inputs (8 &times; 64 &times; 2.67GE = 1, 368 GE) and three 64-bit XORs with three inputs (3 &times; 64 &times; 4.67 GE = 896 GE). Note that the XOR addition of the constants can be achieved by inverting the appropriate bit positions. Since we chose five constants that all have Hamming weight 1, the area requirement for the XOR addition of the constants is about 3 GE. In total the minimal requirement for a round-based implementation of C-PRESENT-192 would sum up to more than 9, 300 GE and these figures do not even include the finite state machine of the control logic. This is far away from our ideal goal of around 2, 000 GEs and consequently we do not follow this approach any further.<sup>5</sup></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, following the above stated trade-off, it is possible to sacrifice throughput for the benefit of area savings. Since a PRESENT datapath consists of the storage for 64 bits, the requirements for the S-boxes and the key XOR, we chose to use as few datapaths as possible. In our proposed C-PRESENT-192 the key schedule is shared by three PRESENT datapaths. In order to benefit from the shared key schedule, at least three PRESENT datapaths are required. Therefore, we base our estimations on three serialized PRESENT datapaths.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A serialized PRESENTdatapath basically consists of the storage for the state (384 GE), the key XOR (11 GE) and the S-box (28 GE), which sums up to a total gate count of 384 + 11 + 28 = 423 GE. Besides three PRESENTdatapathes (3 &times; 423 GE = 1, 269 GE) and one PRESENT-128 key schedule (837 GE) C-PRESENT-192 requires to store at least five additional 64-bit temporary values (5 &times; 64 GE = 1, 920 GE), 13 4-bit MUXes (13 &times; 4 &times; 2.33 GE = 121 GE), which would lead to 4, 150 GE. Additionally, several XOR gates and a finite state machine are required, so in total we estimate the area requirements with 4, 600 GE. Such a serialized implementation would require 3, 338 clock cycles for processing one block of 64 bits, giving it a throughput of 1.9 Kbps at 100 KHZ. In total this would lead to a hardware efficiency of 0.41 bps. From these estimations it becomes clear that also a serialized implementation of C-PRESENT-192 requires too much area, mostly because of the huge intermediate storage requirements.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-6.7.3" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>6.7.3 Dedicated design elements inspired by</strong> PRESENT</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Hash function design is notoriously difficult and so an interesting first step is to identify some general approaches and to understand their security and performance trade-offs. In this section we describe the results of some prototyping which tests a range of approaches and provides good background to our ongoing work. Our basic premise is to stay close to the design elements of PRESENT and to modify the design so as to give a block cipher with a much larger block size. We then adapt the key schedule in two alternative ways with the first being a natural proposal and the second having strong similarities to Whirlpool [17]. We give implementation results for both approaches.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our schemes will continue to be based on the Davies-Meyer (DM) scheme Hi+1 = E(H<sup>i</sup> , Mi)&oplus; H<sup>i</sup> though the form of our encryption function E will now change. In general, the encryption function E can be described as:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\begin{split} E: \\mathbb{F}_2^n \\times \\mathbb{F}_2^k &amp;\\to \\mathbb{F}_2^n \\ , \\\\ E: \\text{PLAINTEXT} \\times \\text{KEY} &amp;\\mapsto \\text{CIPHERTEXT}. \\end{split}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The detailed description of PRESENT can be found in Section 4. At a top-level we can write the r-round encryption of the plaintext STATE as:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>5</sup>Note that the <sup>C</sup>-PRESENT-192/192 implementation described in [34] only uses two round-based PRESENT datapaths and also shares XOR-gates. Technically speaking this is not a plain round-based implementation, but an approach that uses round-based components in a serialized manner. Therefore it is no wonder that the implementation figures for C-PRESENT-192/192 given in [34] are smaller than our estimates for a plain round-based implementation. However, this design still requires more than 8, 000 GE and hence is far too demanding for our purposes.</p>

STATE \\leftarrow sBoxLayer(STATE)

STATE \\leftarrow pLayer(STATE)

KEY \\leftarrow genLayer(KEY, i)
\\nend for

STATE \\leftarrow STATE \\oplus eLayer(KEY, r + 1),
</code></pre>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where eLayer describes how a subkey is combined with a cipher STATE, sBoxLayer and pLayer describe how the STATE evolves, and genLayer is used to describe the generation of the next subkey.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">When used in the DM mode we recast the plaintext and ciphertext as hash function STATE and use the (formatted) message extract as the key. For ease of design we will choose the parameters k and n so that k|n and 4|n, and both our proposals will have the following (unmodified) structure:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-text">\\begin{aligned} &amp; \\textbf{for } i = 1 \\textbf{ to } r \\textbf{ do} \\\\ &amp; \\textbf{STATE} \\leftarrow \\textbf{STATE} \\oplus \\textbf{eLayer}(\\texttt{MESSAGE}, i) \\\\ &amp; \\textbf{STATE} \\leftarrow \\textbf{sBoxLayer}(\\texttt{STATE}) \\\\ &amp; \\textbf{STATE} \\leftarrow \\textbf{pLayer}(\\texttt{STATE}) \\\\ &amp; \\textbf{MESSAGE} \\leftarrow \\textbf{genLayer}(\\texttt{MESSAGE}, i) \\\\ &amp; \\textbf{end for} \\\\ &amp; \\textbf{STATE} \\leftarrow \\textbf{STATE} \\oplus \\textbf{eLayer}(\\texttt{MESSAGE}, r+1). \\end{aligned}
</code></pre>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The following building blocks are unchanged between the two proposals and are merely generalizations of the PRESENT structure to larger 160-bit block sizes.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>(1) sBoxLayer: This denotes use of the PRESENT  <span class="math">4 \\times 4</span> -bit S-box S and it is applied n/4 times in parallel.</li>
      <li>(2) pLayer: This is an extension of the PRESENT bit-permutation and moves bit i of STATE to bit position P(i), where</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$P(i) = \\begin{cases} i \\cdot n/4 \\mod n - 1, &amp; \\text{if } i \\in \\{0, \\dots, n - 2\\} \\\\ n - 1, &amp; \\text{if } i = n - 1. \\end{cases}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is in the specification of genLayer, which transforms the message of length k from round-to-round, and eLayer :  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2^k \\to \\mathbb{F}_2^n</span> , that describes how the message extract is combined with cipher state, that the two proposals differ.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>PROP-1.</strong> For ease of comparison with PRESENT we keep exactly the same 80-bit key input and the same 80-bit key schedule. Thus we modify a 160-bit chaining variable using an 80-bit message input and, to make an implementation estimate, we use 64 rounds. This is equivalent to the parameters n=160, k=80, and r=64. The sBoxLayer and pLayer are as above and eLayer and genLayer are described as follows:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>(1) eLayer(MESSAGE, i) = MESSAGE||genLayer(MESSAGE, i)</li>
      <li>(2) genLayer(MESSAGE, i) is defined as the 80-bit key schedule of PRESENT. Thus, MESSAGE is rotated by 61-bit positions to the left, the left-most four bits are passed through the PRESENT S-box, and the round counter i is exclusive-ored with some bits of MESSAGE.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In words, we use the key schedule of PRESENT-80 exactly as is and at each round we use what would be two successive 80-bit round keys. At each round the key schedule is updated only</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">once, so the same subkey is used once on the right-hand side and, in the following round, on the left-hand side.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>PROP-2.</strong> For the second proposal, we consider a structure that has some similarity to Whirlpool. Our parameter set is n = 160 and k = 160 which allows us to use a longer message extract at each iteration of the compression function. For prototyping and implementation estimates we set r = 80. The building blocks eLayer and genLayer are specified as:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>(1) eLayer(MESSAGE, i) = MESSAGE</li>
      <li>(2) genLayer(MESSAGE, i) = pLayer(sBoxLayer(MESSAGE &oplus; i)), being just a copy of the data path with round constant addition.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In words, we imagine that our message extract is a 160-bit key and we process the key in a key-schedule that is identical to the encryption process.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our proposed design elements are not intended to be specifications. Nevertheless, some preliminary analysis follows from the simple structures proposed. In particular, for a fixed message block and two different chaining values we can apply Theorem 1 of [33] directly. This states that at least 10 active S-boxes are involved in any 5-round differential characteristic. However, for the more important case of two different message blocks, the analysis has to be slightly modified. The following two results on the differential behavior of the proposals can be viewed as a first step towards a deeper analysis:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 6.1.</strong> <em>Let</em> P (3) (&#8710;1,&#8710;2)7&rarr;&#8710; <em>be the probability of a differential characteristic over 3 rounds of PROP-1 with</em> &#8710;<sup>2</sup> 6= 0<em>, i.e. the probability that</em></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$PROP-1_3(H \\oplus \\Delta_1, M \\oplus \\Delta_2) = PROP-1_3(H, M) \\oplus \\Delta,</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>where</em> PROP-1<sup>3</sup> <em>denotes three rounds of PROP-1. Then each 3-round differential characteristic of this form has at least 4 active S-boxes and therefore</em> P (3) (&#8710;1,&#8710;2)7&rarr;<sup>&#8710;</sup> &le; 2 &minus;8 <em>.</em></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 6.2.</strong> <em>Let</em> P(&#8710;1,&#8710;2)7&rarr;<sup>&#8710;</sup> <em>be the probability of a differential characteristic such that</em></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$PROP-2(H \\oplus \\Delta_1, M \\oplus \\Delta_2) = PROP-2(H, M) \\oplus \\Delta</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">for
<span class="math">$\\Delta_2 \\neq 0</span>$
. Then  <span class="math">P_{(\\Delta_1, \\Delta_2) \\mapsto \\Delta} \\leq 2^{-400}</span>  for PROP-2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Theorem 6.1 indicates that the probability of each 64-round differential characteristic can be upper-bounded by (2&minus;<sup>8</sup> ) 64 <sup>3</sup> &asymp; 2 <sup>&minus;</sup>170. This observation as well as Theorem 6.2 show that the differential properties may be strong enough to thwart pre-image, second pre-image and collision attacks for both proposals. Furthermore, Theorem 6.2 indicates that one could probably decrease the number of rounds in PROP-2 without unduly compromising the security. The most appropriate trade-off remains an area of research.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-6.7.4" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>6.7.4 Estimations of</strong> PROP-1 <strong>and</strong> PROP-2</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We estimated the hardware figures for different architectures when implementing PROP-1 and PROP-2. Our implementation estimates range from a 4-bit width data path (highly serialized) up to a 160-bit width data path which offers one round of processing in one cycle. Since PROP-2 uses a very similar key schedule (<em>i.e.</em> message path) and encryption routine, we can give a further two different implementation options: one with a shared sBoxLayer between the data path and the message path and one with an individual sBoxLayer. The results are summarized in Table 6.4 with the efficiency <em>eff.</em> being measured in bps/GE.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 6.4: Hardware estimations of PROP-1 and PROP-1 using datapath widths from 4 bit to 160 bit.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 6.5 summarizes our results and compares them to other hash functions and AES-based schemes. When the hash output length is 128 bits or lower, a construction based around PRESENT seems to have potential. Certainly they are far more competitive than current hash functions, the primary reason being that there exist efficient block cipher-based constructions for this size of hash output. Even a larger block cipher such as AES makes for a more compact hash function than current dedicated designs at this security level, though the throughput suffers. Also first estimates of an ASIC implementation of SQUASH indicate significantly higher area requirements while at the same time providing a two orders of magnitude lower throughput.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the area estimates of the AES-based <em>Davies-Meyer</em> and <em>Hirose</em> schemes we used the smallest known (3,400 GE) AES implementation [71]. We estimated the area requirements for storing one bit to be 8 GE as stated in [71]. For the AES-based <em>Davies-Meyer scheme</em> we assumed that at least one additional register would be required to store the 128-bit value H<sup>1</sup> (1,024 additional GE), summing up to at least 4,400 GE in total.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The AES-based <em>Hirose scheme</em> requires an AES implementation with 256-bit key length. However, no such low-cost implementation has been reported so far. Therefore we estimate the area requirements starting from the Feldhofer <em>et al.</em> [71] implementation with a 128-bit key. At least 128 additional key bits (1,024 GE) have to be stored to achieve an AES implementation with 256 bits key length, summing up to at least 4,400 GE. The <em>Hirose scheme</em> requires two instantiations of the block cipher and the storage of one intermediate value H1, which has the same size as the block size. All together we estimate the AES-based <em>Hirose scheme</em> to require at least 9,800 GE. The serial variant of C-PRESENT-192 was not implemented, because the figures for the round-based variant and the estimations indicate large area requirements with more than 4, 600 GE. In fact this large area requirement for both variants of C-PRESENT-192 was the main reason to look for other constructions such as PROP-1 and PROP-2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that it is not easily possible to compare power consumption of designs implemented in different technologies, hence we did not include these figures in Table 6.5. However, the figures for SHA-256 (15.87 &micro;W) and SHA-1 (10.68 &micro;W) provided by Feldhofer and Rechberger [72] are in the same range as ours.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">While compact hash functions are often proposed in protocols for RFID tags, there are currently no sufficiently compact candidates to hand. Here we have explored the possibility of building a hash function out of a block cipher such as PRESENT. We have described hash func-</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 6.5: The performance of different hash functions based on the direct application of PRESENT. For comparison with our hash functions with 128-bit output we include estimates for the AESbased 128-bit hash function in Davies-Meyer mode. For comparison with MAME we include estimates for the 256-bit hash function built from the AES in Hirose's construction.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">tions that offer 64- and 128-bit outputs based on current design strategies. For their parameter sets these are the most compact hash function candidates available today. In particular, H-PRESENT-128 requires around 4,000 GE, which is similar to the best known AES implementation and about 50% smaller than the best reported MD5 implementation. At the same time, H-PRESENT-128 requires between 20&ndash;30 <em>times</em> fewer clock cycles than compact AES and MD5 implementations, giving it a major time-area advantage.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Obviously 128-bit hash functions are relevant for applications where a security-performance trade-off is warranted. To obtain larger hash outputs there are severe complications and we suspect that dedicated designs could be more appropriate.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Understanding the best trade-offs for the different approaches is not easy. As one can see, all three estimations of PROP-1 and PROP-2 scale nicely, though it seems that PROP-2 is more efficient in terms of throughput per area when compared to PROP-1. On the other hand PROP-1 offers a lower minimal achievable gate count, though at the cost of a higher cycle count. Much would also depend on a thorough security analysis of any final proposal and while some initial analysis suggests the possibility of optimizations to an approach like PROP-2, this is something to explore in future work during the design of an explicit proposal.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Clearly there are many areas of open research, not least the design of very compact hash functions. In parallel, it might also be worth revisiting tag-based protocols that use hash functions to see if the same goals can be achieved in a different way.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this Chapter first the usage of lightweight public-key cryptography is motivated in Section 7.1 and related work is treated in Section 7.2. Subsequently, a brief introduction to the <em>crypto-GPS</em> identification scheme is given in Section 7.3. Then a prototype board that contains a proof-of-concept ASIC implementation of <em>crypto-GPS</em> is decribed in Section 7.4. The component of the ASIC, three different variants of the <em>crypto-GPS</em> scheme, are described subsequently. First two round-based variants are describe in Section 7.5 and a serialized implementation is detailed in Section 7.6.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The automotive production process nowadays is very sophisticated with a widely distributed division of tasks. Consequently it is also referred to as a <em>supply chain</em> [97] or even more precise a <em>supply network</em>. On the different steps in the production process different supplier and sub-supplier deliver components or modules just-in-time (JIT). Some modules, such as dashboards or seats are delivered just-in-sequence (JIS). It is of paramount importance to identify components cheaply and reliably in order to guarantee to have the right part at the right place of the assembly line at the right point in time (JIT) in the right order (JIS). Since many different players are here involved, this kind of scenarios for RFID applications is also referred to as <em>open systems</em>. An overview of potentials and risks for automotive supply-chains that use RFID tags from an economic perspective is provided in [183]. One conclusion is that there are great optimization potentials, but also severe security threats if RFID tags are used in open systems.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The former chapters dealt with symmetric cryptographic primitives, which have the drawback of the key-distribution problem. In <em>closed systems</em> RFID tags, readers and the backend system are controlled by a single player. However, this poses no great difficulty, but for open systems it does. Lightweight public-key cryptography may be suitable to address these problems.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">There exists a rich literature on low-area implementations of public key cryptography based on elliptic curves (ECC). Comparison of different ECC implementations is not always easy, because the choice of the underlying curve determines both efficiency and security of the algorithm. However, no implementation has been published so far that comes close to the goal of 2, 000 GE, but several publications&mdash;with a significantly lower security level than 80-bit&mdash;exist that are in the range of 10, 000 GE or above [18, 68, 75]. Gaubatz <em>et al.</em> [76] have investigated the hardware efficiency of the NTRUencrypt algorithm [174, 106] with the following parameters (N, p, q) = (167, 3, 128) that offer a security level of only 57 bits. Though their implementation requires only 2, 850 GE, it takes 29, 225 clock cycles, which translates to 292 ms, for the response to be computed. However, it is noteworthy that more than 80% of the area is occupied with storage elements and that already a bit serial datapath is used, which implies that the chance of future improvements is very limited. Oren <em>et al.</em> propose a public key identification scheme called <em>WIPR</em> [177] that is based on the randomized variant [87] of the Rabin crypto system [190]. Their ASIC implementation requires 5, 705 GE and 66, 048 clock cycles, which is still significantly larger than 2, 000 GE.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this Section first a brief historical overview of GPS is given, before relevant parameters and optimization tricks are presented.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In 1991 Girault describes self-certified public keys in [81] and 1998 Poupard and Stern analyzed the security of practical &quot;on-the-fly&quot; authentication and signature systems [185]. In 2006 Marc <em>G</em>irault, Guillaume <em>P</em>oupard and Jacques <em>S</em>tern proposed an &quot;On the Fly Authentiction and Signature Scheme Based on Groups of Unknown Order&quot; in [85].<sup>1</sup> In the remainder we focus on the identification scheme. Nowadays, crypto-GPS is standardized within the international standard ISO/IEC 9798-5 [112]. Furthermore it is listed within the final NESSIE recommendations [113].</p>

      <h4 id="sec-7.3.2" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>7.3.2 Parameters and optimizations</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since crypto-GPS offers a variety of parameters for different security-performance trade-offs, optimizations have been widely discussed in the literature. In the following we will focus on the optimizations that have actually been chosen for our implementation. Starting with the elliptic curve-based variant, we will discuss coupons, low Hamming weight (LHW) challenges, compact encoding of the LHW challenge, and the usage of a PRNG.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-misc-17" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>Elliptic curve-base</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Though there are variants of the crypto-GPS scheme that are based on RSA-like moduli, we use a variant that uses elliptic curve operations, because it allows smaller keys. Brute-force attacks require a square-root work effort [84], consequently for a security level of 80 bits a secret s with &sigma; = |s| = 160 bits is required.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-misc-18" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8"><strong>Coupons</strong></h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In [82] Girault described a storage-computation trade-off for the crypto-GPS scheme that uses t coupons, each consisting of a pair (r<sup>i</sup> , xi) for 1 &le; i &le; t. These coupons are stored on the tag before deployment. The on-tag computation then can be reduced to y = r<sup>i</sup> + (s &times; c), where c is a challenge of &delta; = |c| bits length provided by the reader and s is a &sigma;-bit secret that is stored on the tag. Figure 7.1 shows a general overview of the elliptic curve-based variant of crypto-GPS that we used. Here h denotes the length from an arbitrary hash function HASH.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>1</sup> In the following we refer to this asymmetric identification scheme as <em>crypto-GPS</em> in order to not confuse with the widespread Global Positioning System.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-misc-19" class="text-2xl font-bold"><strong>Low Hamming weight challenge</strong></h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In order to avoid the computationally rather demanding (&sigma; &times; &delta;)-bit multiplication, it is possible to turn it into a series of simple additions [84]. For this purpose, it is required to turn the challenge c into a <em>Low Hammingweight (LHW) challenge</em> [84] such that at least &sigma; &minus; 1 zero bits are between two subsequent 1 bits. When using binary representations of the multiplicands it is easy to see that multiplications can be performed using the basic Shift-And-Add multiplication algorithm [178]. Always when a bit of the input challenge c is 0, the multiplicand s is shifted to the left by one position. When the bit of the input challenge c is 1 the multiplicand s is shifted to the left and the result is added (with carry) to the multiplicand s. This way a complete multiplication can be reduced to simple shiftings and additions. Since in our case we use a low Hamming weight challenge that has all 1 bits at least &sigma; &minus; 1 zero bits apart, it is ensured that there is no overlap in subsequent additions of s. In other words, s is never added more than once at the same time.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In our implementation we use the following parameters: &sigma; = |s| = 160 and a challenge c of length &delta; = |c| = 848 with a Hamming weight of 5. The specifications of GPS state that the parameters are typical set to &rho; = |r| = &sigma; + &delta; + 80. For the chosen values this leads to &rho; = |r| = 160 + 848 + 80 = 1, 088 bits. According to [84] these parameters enable crypto-GPS to achieve a security level equivalent to a probability of impersonation of 2 <sup>&minus;</sup>32. This combination of coupons and LHW leads to the most efficient implementation for constrained devices as has been pointed out in [83, 151, 152].</p>

    <h3 id="sec-misc-20" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8"><strong>Compact encoding of the LHW challenge</strong></h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Also in [151, 83] two encoding schemes have been proposed that allow to use only 40 bits to encode the complete 848-bit challenge c. In our implementation we will use a modified variant of the encoding scheme that was proposed for the 8-bit architecture in [151]. In particular it assumes that the challenge c consists of five 8-bit chunks n<sup>i</sup> , or in other words c = n4kn3kn2kn1kn0. Each n<sup>i</sup> consists of the 5-bit number c<sup>1</sup> and the 3-bit number c<sup>2</sup> (n<sup>i</sup> = ci,2kci,1) and encodes the exact position of one of the five non-zero bits of the 848-bit low Hamming weight challenge.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In particular, the positions of the non-zero bits can be calculated by the following recursive equation:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$P(i) = 160 + 8 \\cdot c_{i,1} + c_{i,2} \\quad 1 \\le i \\le 4</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$P(0) = 8 \\cdot c_{0,1} + c_{0,2} \\quad i = 0.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let us consider two example challenges Ccomp,<sup>1</sup> and Ccomp,2. A compact transmitted challenge</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$C_{comp,1} = \\begin{array}{c|c|c} n_4 &amp; n_3 &amp; n_2 &amp; n_1 &amp; n_0 \\\\ \\hline 00 &amp; 00 &amp; 00 &amp; 00 &amp; 00 \\end{array}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">in hexadecimal notation gives us the following ci,<sup>1</sup> and ci,2. Now it is easy to calculate the positions of the non-zero bits P(i) according to the above equation.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-misc-21" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8"><strong>Usage of PRNG</strong></h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Storing coupons cost memory space and especially in both hardware and software implementation for embedded devices memory is a significant cost factor. Hence, the size of the coupons limits the amount of available coupons for a given amount of memory or increases the cost. One approach considers using shorter hash length [86] to lower memory requirements. The ISO standard 9798 [112] suggests the usage of a PRNG for regenerating r<sup>i</sup> instead of storing it. This would lower the size of each coupon at the fixed cost of implementing a PRNG. We chose to use PRESENT in output feedback mode (OFB) to serve as the PRNG for our crypto-GPS implementations.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-7.3.3" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>7.3.3 Design decisions</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The following optimizations have been considered for this prototype:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>(1) Elliptic curves-based variant rather than RSA-based allows shorter keys thus reducing the storage requirements.</li>
      <li>(2) Coupons/pre-computations avoid hashing and elliptic curve operations on the tag.</li>
      <li>(3) LHW challenges reduce the on-tag (&sigma; &times; &delta;)-bit multiplication to simple additions.</li>
      <li>(4) Compact encoding of LHW challenge allows to reduce the transmission time.</li>
      <li>(5) Usage of a PRNG reduces storage for the random values.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">While all of these optimizations have already been considered and studied in [83, 151, 152] the here described implementations have different features. First of all, the implementations described in [152] assume that the 1, 088-bit random number stream r and the 160-bit secret s are provided in 8-bit chunks on-demand and that the 848-bit challenge c is provided bit-serial, 1 bit in each cycle. This however implies that r and s have to be stored in a separate memory on the tag. Furthermore, this assumption also implies some kind of memory addressing logic that selects the appropriate 8-bit chunk of r and s on-demand once requested by the GPS core. The implementations described in [151] also assume that the 1, 088-bit random number stream r and the 160-bit secret s are provided in 8-bit or 16-bit chunks (depending on the architecture) on-demand. Furthermore it is assumed that the compact challenge c is input into the GPS core in 8-bit chunks on-demand. Similar to the implementations described in [152] this implies that r, s and c are stored in an additional memory on the tag and that there is a memory addressing logic. Figures for the additional logic (memory controller, memory) on the tag however are estimated (1, 000 GE for a PRNG) or not provided.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The implementations described in Sections 7.5 (GPS-64/8-F) and 7.6 (GPS-4/4-F) read in the complete compact challenge c and a 64-bit initialization vector IV at the beginning of the computation. Though the secret s will be fixed in practical applications, we have also implemented a variant (GPS-64/8-V) with a variable s in order to scrutinize performance trade-offs for different values of s. Therefore, the (GPS-64/8-V) variant also awaits an s value at the beginning of the computation. The 64-bit IV will be used to initialize a PRESENT-80 core in <em>Output-Feedback</em>-mode (OFB) that will act as the PRNG. At the end of one run, <em>i.e.</em> after 17 complete iterations of PRESENT (17 &middot; 64 bit = 1, 088 bit), the ASIC also outputs the internal state of the PRESENT core, which will act as the new IV for the next run.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Before we turn to the detailed description of the crypto-GPS implementations in Sections 7.5 and 7.6, we first describe the prototype board in the next section in order to better understand the design constraints.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To proof the efficiency of the crypto-GPS scheme and to study different design trade-offs, Orange Labs, Paris, France decided to fabricate a proof-of-concept ASIC that should be able to respond to a challenge in less than 200 ms. We implemented three different architectures in VHDL. The functional simulated variants were sent to IHP<sup>3</sup> , a german chip foundry. IHP offers so-called multi-design ASICs, were a set of different designs from different customers is bundled on the same wafer. This procedure ensures significant cost savings for the production of the lithographic mask, which in turn allows us to fabricate three different designs for a limited budget. An ATMEL ATmega323 [12] microcontroller (&micro;C) is used to simulate the remaining parts of an RFID tag. As such it provides the ASIC with the challenge cin and the secret s (for some variants) and receives the output of the ASIC. In order to have a proof-of-concept prototype it should be possible to easily demonstrate the functionality of the crypto-GPS variants. Therefore the board contains a serial USB interface for easy communication with a PC. The &micro;C converts the bit serial data stream from the USB interface to the 8-bit parallel I/O of the ASIC and vice versa. Figure 7.2 depicts the layout of the prototype board.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-7.4.1" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>7.4.1 The input and output pins of the ASIC</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One requirement of the shared design ASIC was that all variants have the same I/O pins. In order to have the possibility of using a small packaging we tried to use as few pins as possible. Beside the mandatory pins for power supply we decided to use the following 20 I/O pins:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>clk</strong> one pin is required to clock the ASIC with the right frequency.</p>

</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 7.2: Layout diagram of the crypto-GPS prototype board.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>n reset</strong> one pin is required to reset the ASIC.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>rx</strong> this pin is required for the I/O handshake protocol as the input channel to the ASIC.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>tx</strong> this pin is required for the I/O handshake protocol as the output channel of the ASIC.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">data in these eight pins are used to load values into the ASIC.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">data out these eight pins are used to output the result.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since the microcontroller ( <span class="math">\\mu</span> C) is clocked independently from the ASIC, both components have to be synchronized when they are communicating. Therefore a handshake protocol with the following steps was implemented (see Figure 7.3):</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>(1)  <span class="math">\\mu</span> C sets input data</li>
      <li>(2) wait until input data valid</li>
      <li>(3)  <span class="math">\\mu</span> C sets tx to '0' indicating that input data are valid</li>
      <li>(4) wait until ASIC notices that input is valid (IO_READ_WAIT)</li>
      <li>(5) ASIC sets rx to '0' indicating that input is being read (IO_READ_INPUT)</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We implemented one crypto-GPS variant with a round-based PRESENT-80 core, an internal datapath of 8 bits and a fixed secret s. We refer to this variant in the following as GPS-64/8-F and describe the implementation in Section 7.5. Some applications might require that the secret s is going to be updated. For this reason and in order to exploit the performance trade-offs for different values of s we implemented a GPS variant with a round-based PRESENT-80 core, an internal datapath of 8 bits and a variable secret s which is referred to as GPS-64/8-V. We will also provide details about this implementation in Section 7.5. Another design trade-off is to use a serialized PRESENT-80 core instead of a round-based one. For this variant it is advantageous to use an internal datapath of 4 bits. Furthermore we decided to implement this variant with a fixed secret s. Details for this GPS-4/4-F called variant are provided in Section 7.6. Finally, the ASIC also contains a variant that consists only of a serialized PRESENT-80 encryption core. This implementation is similar to the serialized PRESENT-80 implementation described in Section 5.1.1 but also contains I/O logic. Especially noteworthy is the implementation of the handshake protocol that lead to a significant increase of the area requirements (1, 220 GE compared to 1, 075 GE). At the time of the submission of this Thesis the ASIC has not yet been</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The architecture of GPS-64/8-F is depicted in Figure 7.4. It uses a round-based PRESENT-80 implementation (PRESENT), a Controller component, a full-adder component (Addwc) and a storage component (S_Storage). In the following these components are described in detail. Since the PRESENT component is similar to the one described in Section 5.1.2 we refer the interested reader there. Starting with the Controller component in Section 7.5.1, the Addwc component is described in Section 7.5.2. Finally two different S_storage components are described in Sections 7.5.3 and 7.5.4.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 7.6: Architecture of the adder component of all crypto-GPS variants.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The controller consists of four separate but interacting FSMs each one for the central control (see Figure 7.5(a)), I/O (Figure 7.5(b)), S_STORAGE (Figure 7.5(c)) and PRESENT (Figure 7.5(d)). It requires 64 clock cycles to initialize the ASIC and load the values IV , cin and s. In the round based version it requires 32 cycles to create 64 pseudo random bits by the PRESENT component and to add it with the appropriate chunk of the secret s. Due to the handshaking protocol, it then requires 64 cycles to output the result in 8-bit chunks. Since we have to compute 1, 088 bits we have to repeat this procedure another 16 times. Finally the internal state of the PRESENT component has to be stored outside the ASIC as the new IV for the next iteration of crypto-GPS. So in total (including I/O overhead) it takes 17 &middot; (32 + 64) + 64 = 1, 696 clock cycles for one complete run of crypto-GPS.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-7.5.2" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>7.5.2 Implementation of the Addwc component</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 7.6 depicts the ADDWC component. As one can see, it consists of a flip-flop to store the carry bit and a standard full-adder component. For the round-based variants GPS-64/8-F and GPS-64/8-V it has a datapath width of 8 bits, <em>i.e.</em> two 8-bit input values are added.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-7.5.3" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>7.5.3 Implementation of the S_Storage component with a fixed secret</strong> s</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 7.7(a) depicts the architecture of the S_Storage component for a fixed secret s. It consists of an 8-bit AND gate (11 GE), an 8-bit OR gate (11 GE), a gated register with 8 bit input (48 GE), an 8-bit 20-to-1 MUX (249 GE), and a shifting component denoted with (&quot;00000000&quot;||a)&laquo;c2. First, the right 8-bit chunk of s is chosen by the MUX, which then is ANDed with the 8-bit signal n_zero. n_zero replicates eight times a single bit of the control_vector, hence it can either be set to &quot;00000000&quot; or &quot;11111111&quot;. This way the resulting value a is either set to the corresponding 8-bit chunk of s or &quot;00000000&quot;, before it is processed by the shifting component. The shifting component has a second input, namely the shifting offset c2. Within the shifting component the input value a is appended to the string &quot;00000000&quot; in order to yield the intermediate state b, <em>i.e.</em> in VHDL notation</p>

    <pre><code class="language-text">b &lt;= &quot;00000000&quot;&amp;a;.
</code></pre>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It then rotates b by c2 positions to the left. Since c2 has three bits, the shifting offset varies between 0 and 7. Finally, it outputs two 8-bit values c and d, which consist of the 8 MSB (c) and the 8 LSB (d) of the internal state b. c is stored in an 8-bit gated register and d is ORed with the output of the gated register.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-7.5.4" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>7.5.4 Implementation of the S_Storage component with a variable secret</strong> s</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 7.7(b) depicts the architecture of the S_Storage component that is capable to process variable secrets s. It consists of an 8-bit 4-to-1 input MUX, an 8-bit 3-to-1 output MUX, an 8-bit AND, an 8-bit OR and 22 gated shifting registers that each store 8 bit. 20 of these shifting registers are required to store the complete secret s and the remaining two are required to temporarily store the shifted values for the next addition cycle.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The architecture of GPS-4/4-F is depicted in Figure 7.8(a). As one can see, the general structure is very close to the architecture of the round-based variants GPS-64/8-F and GPS-64/8- V (see Figure 7.4). It also feeds the 8-bit input value cin into the Controller component, but contrary to the round-based variants it splits this value and feeds the higher nibble into the S_Storage component and the lower nibble into the PRESENT component. Since it uses an internal datapath of 4 bits, also the outputs of the PRESENT, S_Storage and the Addwc components are only 4 bits width. Therefore the 4-bit output signal data_out is padded with &quot;0000&quot; in order to fulfill the requirements of an 8 bit I/O interface. It uses a serialized PRESENT-80 implementation (PRESENT), a Controller component, a full-adder component (Addwc) and a storage component for fixed s (S_Storage). Since the PRESENT component is similar to the one described in Section 5.1.1 and the Addwc component was already described in Section 7.5.2, we refer the interested reader there. However, the Controller and the S_Storage components are different and consequently we detail them in the remainder of this section.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-7.6.1" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>7.6.1 Implementation of the Controller component</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The Controller module consists of the same four FSMs that were already described in Section 7.5.1. Three of them (central FSM, I/O FSM and storage FSM, see Figures 7.5(a) to 7.5(c)) are similar to the ones used for the round-based variants and we refer to Section 7.5.1 for further details. Figure 7.8(b) depicts the FSM of the serialized PRESENT-80 component. Due to the serialized approach it is significantly more complex than the FSM for a round-based implementation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It requires 64 clock cycles to initialize the ASIC and load the values IV , cin and s. In the serialized version it requires 563 cycles to create 64 pseudo random bits by the PRESENT component and to add them to the appropriate chunk of the secret s. Due to the handshaking protocol, it then requires 64 cycles to output the result in 4-bit chunks. Since we have to compute 1, 088 bits we have to repeat this procedure another 16 times. Finally the internal state of the PRESENT component has to be stored outside the ASIC as the new IV for the next iteration of crypto-GPS. So in total (including I/O overhead) it takes 17 &middot;(563 + 64) + 64 = 10, 723 clock cycles for one complete run of crypto-GPS.</p>

As one can see, it is very similar to the S_Storage component of the round-based variant GPS-64/8-F (see Figure 7.7(a)). In fact it just splits the 8-bit input value into two 4-bit chunks. Dependent on a counter value it outputs either the higher or the lower nibble.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For functional and post-synthesis simulation we used <em>Mentor Graphics Modelsim SE PLUS 6.3a</em> [92] and <em>Synopsys DesignCompiler</em> version <em>Z-2007.12-SP1</em> [218] was used to synthesize the designs to two different standard-cell libraries. Table 7.1 summarizes the implementation results of the three different architectures of crypto-GPS. We provide area figures from post-synthesis for two different libraries. One is the <em>Virtual Silicon</em> (VST) standard cell library <em>UMCL18G212T3</em>, which is based on the <em>UMC L180 0.18</em>&micro;<em>m 1P6M</em> logic process and has a typical voltage of 1.8 Volt [233]. Since throughout this Thesis we used this library for many other designs<sup>4</sup> , we also provide area figures for crypto-GPS synthesized to the UMC library in order to enable a fairer comparison with the other designs. On the other hand we provide area figures for crypto-GPS for the <em>IHP</em> standard cell library <em>SESAME-LP2-IHP0.25UM</em>, which is compatible to the <em>IHP 0.25</em> &micro;<em>m Logic 1P4M Salicide</em> process and has a typical voltage of 2.5 Volt [64]. Since we manufactured an ASIC that uses this process (see Figure 7.9 for a photograph), it is interesting to see how the post-synthesis figures compare to the manufactured ones.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 7.9: Photograph of the manufactured crypto-GPS ASIC.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As one can see from Table 7.1 the round-based variants GPS-64/8-F and GPS-64/8-V require 1, 696 clock cycles and the serialized variant GPS-4/4-F requires 10, 723 clock cycles for processing one challenge. At a frequency of 100KHz this translates to 16.96 ms and 107.23 ms, which is well below the required 200 ms. The area requirements (for the <em>UMCL18G212T3</em> library) range from 3, 976 GE for GPS-64/8-V over 2, 556 GE for GPS-64/8-F to 2, 181 GE for GPS-4/4-F. Given the more than 6 <em>times</em> longer processing time, it seems that a serialized PRESENT implementation only provides a slight benefit compared to a round-based implementation. However, flexibility comes at a high price: while the fixed secret variants can hardwire s and select the appropriate chunk with MUXes, the variable variant has to use 160 flip-flops, which results in a significant area overhead.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Oren <em>et al.</em> propose a public key identification scheme called <em>WIPR</em> [177] that is based on the randomized variant [87] of the Rabin crypto system [190]. Their ASIC implementation requires 5, 705 GE and 66, 048 clock cycles, which is still significantly larger than 2, 000 GE. Furthermore it takes more than 6 <em>times</em> longer to process one challenge compared to our serialized implementation and 39 <em>times</em> longer compared to our round-based variants while being significantly larger. While offering a significantly lower security level, even the smallest published ECC implementations require more than 10, 000 GE and hence are far away from being lightweight. Gaubatz <em>et al.</em> [76] have investigated the hardware efficiency of the NTRUencrypt algorithm [174, 106] with the following parameters (N, p, q) = (167, 3, 128) that offer a security level of only 57 bits. Though their implementation requires only 2, 850 GE, it takes 29, 225 clock cycles, which translates to 292 ms, for the response to be computed. However, it is noteworthy that more than 80% of the area is occupied with storage elements and that already a bit serial datapath is used, which implies that the chance of future improvements is very limited.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this Chapter physical security aspects and their relation to lightweight implementations are discussed. Starting with a motivation in Section 8.1, we define a pervasive attacker model in Section 8.2. Subsequently, pervasive devices are classified in Section 8.3 Then we provide an evaluation of pervasive devices with regard to physical security aspects in Section 8.4. Subsequently, in Section 8.5 side channel attacks and their countermeasures are introduced. Then in Section 8.6 the cost overhead of side channel countermeasures are assessed for lightweight hardware and software implementations of PRESENT-80. Finally this Chapter is concluded and pointer for future work are provided in Section 8.7.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Even though modern ciphers like AES seem to be resistant against cryptographic attacks, such as linear or differential cryptanalysis [149, 26], it might be possible to attack the <em>implementation</em> of the algorithm. In the last years it became clear that an implementation of a cryptographic algorithm can leak sensitive information about processed key-related data. The term side channel analysis summarizes all possible ways of collecting this information, such as processing time [130], power consumption [131] or electromagnetic emission [8]. Side channel attacks pose a severe threat for pervasive devices, because of their deployment &quot;in the field&quot;. If a device implements no countermeasures against tampering, an adversary may manipulate the operation environment of the device (voltage, clock frequency) or intrude the device for example by <em>micro probing</em>. An adversary may deduce from side channel information (electromagnetic emission, power consumption) or from the device's behavior to her manipulations (time delays) critical security parameters like a secret key stored inside the device.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For a security evaluation of pervasive devices it is important to classify the attackers, which will be carried out in Section 8.2.1. Subsequently in Section 8.2.2 physical attacks will be classified and finally in Section 8.2.3 costs of an attack will be discussed.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-8.2.1" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>8.2.1 Classification of attackers</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since the requirements in terms of cost, time, expertise and equipment differ significantly for different attacks, it is important to classify the attackers. We adopted the classes proposed in [1] and [6], respectively<sup>1</sup> :</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>1</sup>Please note that the amount of money spent by the attackers is a vague estimation that is not backed by literature.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li><strong>Class 1, Clever Outsiders:</strong> &quot;These attackers are often very intelligent but may have insufficient knowledge of the system. They may have access to only moderately sophisticated equipment. They often try to take advantage of an existing weakness in the system, rather than try to create one.&quot; We believe that clever outsider will typically not spent more than 5,000 EUR for the whole attack including equipment and salary.</li>
      <li><strong>Class 2, Knowledgeable Insiders:</strong> &quot;These attackers have substantial specialized technical education and experience. They have varying degrees of understanding of parts of the system but potential access to most of it. They often have highly sophisticated tools and instruments for analysis.&quot; Knowledgeable insiders may also spend up to 5,000 EUR for an attack, but they can use expensive equipment free of charge.</li>
      <li><strong>Class 3, Funded Organizations:</strong> &quot;These attackers are able to assemble teams of specialists with related and complementary skills backed by great funding resources. They are capable of in-depth analysis of the system, designing sophisticated attacks, and using the most advanced analysis tools. They may use class 2 adversaries as part of the attack team.&quot; Funded organizations may spend several 100,000's EUR for an attack. Notice that combinations of attacker classes are also possible and bear a great security risk. Imagine a knowledgeable insider who distributes his knowledge via the Internet to many clever outsiders.</li>
    </ul>

      <h4 id="sec-8.2.2" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>8.2.2 Classification of attacks</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Following Anderson <em>et al.</em> [7], we categorize the attacks in either <em>active</em> or <em>passive</em> and either <em>local</em> or <em>remote</em> attacks. During an active attack the adversary tries to manipulate the device, its input or its environment to cause abnormal behavior, while during a passive attack, the adversary works with the device as it is operated normally. Local attacks can be further separated into invasive, semi-invasive and non-invasive attacks. Invasive attacks are classified by a direct electrical access to the internal components of the device, for example by micro-probing [134]. Even though, semi-invasive attacks do neither require direct electrical contact nor damage the silicon, they need a de-packaged chip. Thus, an adversary requires access to the device. Anderson <em>et al.</em> [7] give the following example for a semi-invasive attack: &quot;the attacker may use a laser beam to ionize a transistor and thus change the state of the flip-flop that holds the device's protection state&quot;. Non-invasive attacks include close observation and manipulation of the device's operation, for example differential power analysis [131]. For this kind of attacks, no extremely sophisticated equipment is necessary. Even class 1 attacker can organize some second-hand equipment (like high-grade oscilloscope) for this attack. Remote attacks include observation of the normal input and output of the device, for example timing analysis, cryptanalysis, protocol analysis, and attacks on the application programming interface. A special kind of remote attacks are Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. In this case an attacker's aim is to compromise the availability of functions of the device. As an extreme example for a Denial of Service attack consider the following: an attacker could send lots of requests to the device, forcing it to compute answers. After a certain time period the energy resources will be exhausted and the node stops working. That is the reason why active devices are more susceptible to Denial of Service attacks than passive devices. However, since this is not a physical security concern, it was not considered in our evaluation.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-8.2.3" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>8.2.3 Classification of attack costs</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We assume that the cost of an attack consists of two parts: initial costs C<sup>i</sup> and cost per device Cd. The average costs per device C to break x devices are estimated by the following equation:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$C = \\frac{C_i + x \\cdot C_d}{x}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As one can see from this equation, with larger x, the initial cost C<sup>i</sup> become negligible. While high initial costs C<sup>i</sup> put off class I and class II attackers but not class III attackers, high breaking costs per device C<sup>d</sup> also scare class III attackers. The optimization goal is therefore to increase the cost per device C<sup>d</sup> as much as possible.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Resistance against tampering is used as the main characteristic to distinguish the classes, because we classify the devices with regard to security issues. The classes are:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>unprotected devices</li>
      <li>partly protected devices</li>
      <li>tamper resistant devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Another property which we used to classify devices is the power supply. If a device provides not its own power supply, it is called a <em>passive</em> device. If a device has a built-in power supply it is called an <em>active</em> device. Active devices usually have a longer range than passive devices, but, if battery powered, they offer an additional resource, which an attacker might attack. Therefore, we further separated each of the three classes into active and passive devices. In our classification scheme device costs also play an important role. If millions or even billions of devices are deployed, the price of a single device becomes a knock-out criterion. Thus, we classified the devices on their estimated prize as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>low:</strong> less than 1 EUR (e.g. passive RFID label)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>medium:</strong> 1 - 10 EUR (e.g. smart card)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>high:</strong> more than 10 EUR (e.g. high-end smart card)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The NIST standard FIPS 140-02 [160] defines four levels of physical security for cryptographic modules:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Level 1:</strong> devices with no special protection mechanisms</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Level 2:</strong> devices, that implement tamper evidence mechanisms</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Level 3:</strong> devices, that implement tamper evidence and tamper response mechanisms</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Level 4:</strong> devices, that implement tamper evidence, tamper response and environmental protection mechanisms/environmental testing</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Tamper evidence mechanisms</em> provide the evidence, that an attack has been attempted (for example a seal). <em>Tamper response mechanisms</em> actively react to the detection of an attack (for example a zeroization circuit that deletes the secure key). <em>Environmental protection mechanisms</em> measure the voltage and temperature of the device. Environmental testing means, that a device undergo a testing procedure with extreme voltages and temperatures before it is deployed. According to Anderson <em>et al.</em> [7], there is a clear bifurcation in the smart card market between low-cost smart cards and state of the art secure smart cards. Low-cost smart cards offer rudimentary protection such that we denote them as <em>passive partly protected devices'</em>. We will have a look at highly secure smart cards in Section 8.3.3 as <em>passive tamper resistant devices</em>. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices comprise a wide variety of devices. Because this ranges from single bit transponders to contact-less smart cards, the term RFID is not suitable for our classification scheme. In each case one has to classify an RFID transponder based on the properties of the device. However, we use the term RFID as an equivalent to passive low-cost RFID tags, therefore we will use the term RFID tags synonymous to passive unprotected pervasive devices.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-8.3.1" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>8.3.1 Unprotected pervasive devices</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Unprotected pervasive devices typically have been developed for mass-market applications. Furthermore, we assume that one of the main designing constraints, probably the most important one, for this kind of devices was low production cost. As a consequence of this sharp cost calculation, unprotected devices were not designed to provide any countermeasures against tampering. A standard passivation layer is the top most layer of every micro-controller. If the secret key is stored in an external memory an adversary can simply read it out and the passivation layer is useless. In this sense it is not really a countermeasure, but it can extend the time needed for an attacker to gain access to the controller chip. Unprotected devices usually comprise embedded processors, which are normally very cheap and hence best suited for mass deployment. The following list summarizes the main characteristics of unprotected devices:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>low-cost</li>
      <li>no security driven design</li>
      <li>small/lightweight</li>
      <li>only external memory (e.g. flash memory or EEPROM)</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A special subset of unprotected devices are passive unprotected devices. They do not have an own power supply and are extremely low-cost devices. They are supposed to be very small, lightweight and hence very mobile. Examples for this device class are RFIDs tags used as electronic product codes for 0.55 cent. Active unprotected devices are quite similar to passive unprotected devices. They are supposed to be cheap, small, lightweight and also mobile. The main difference is their own power supply. Hence they are additionally susceptible to denial of service attacks. MicaMotes [52] serve as an example for active unprotected devices.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-8.3.2" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>8.3.2 Partly protected pervasive devices</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With regard to physical security mechanisms partly protected devices in our classification scheme equal Level 3 devices in FIPS 140-2. The aim of this device class is to prevent an intruder to gain access to critical security parameters, like plaintext key, which are stored inside the device. This includes mechanisms that have a high probability of tamper-detection, such as:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>top-metal sensor meshes</li>
      <li>light-sensors</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Nowadays high-grade smart cards have a sensor mesh implemented in the top metal layer. A sensor mesh consists of sensor, ground and power lines in a serpentine pattern. An adversary, who destroys a sensor line or shortens it to ground or power, causes the device to self-destruct. For micro-probing it is necessary to open a device and remove the standard passivation layer to gain access to the chip's surface. Light sensors can be used to prevent an opened chip from working. If one of these sensors detects an intrusion attempt, a tamper-response mechanism is triggered. Usually tamper-response mechanisms are zeroization circuits that erase all critical security parameters stored on the device. Beside tamper-detection and tamper-response mechanisms, partly protected devices may have one or more of the following countermeasures implemented:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>glue logic</li>
      <li>noise generators</li>
      <li>internal bus hardware encryption</li>
      <li>password restricted software access to internal memory</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Microcontrollers used to be separated in standard building-blocks, like CPU instruction decoder, register file, ALU and I/O circuits. These blocks could be easily identified with an optical microscope. Glue logic describes a randomized ASIC-like logic design where the blocks cannot be identified any more. For an adversary it is virtually impossible to find signals for probing by hand in a glue logic design, hence invasive attacks based on micro-probing are thwarted by this countermeasure [7]. Internal bus hardware encryption makes data analysis more difficult and thus improves the security level. Password restricted software access to internal memory is a countermeasure against simple attacks to read out the whole memory. If the memory content is encrypted an adversary gains no advantage any more. Noise generators aim at thwarting side channel attacks like differential power analysis. They generate noise to obscure the actual signals in the controller. It has become clear that noise generators can not prevent side channel attacks in general, yet they can significantly increase the effort for an adversary to succeed. The following list summarizes the main characteristics of partly protected devices:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>medium cost</li>
      <li>security is a design goal</li>
      <li>at least one of the above listed countermeasures is implemented</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Passive partly protected devices implement one or more of the above mentioned countermeasures against tampering attacks. Although some of these countermeasures need power to work properly (all kind of sensors) they can be implemented as well on passive devices. An adversary can invade a passive device without any concern as long as the device is not powered on. Once the device is powered on, the sensors detect an intrusion attempt and zeroize all critical security parameters like the plaintext key. Hence the countermeasures work with a delay, giving an adversary a time window where she can try to bypass the countermeasures. In practice, the countermeasures are quite sophisticated and it is a hard and time consuming work to bypass them. Examples for this device class are secure memory modules or basic smart cards. Similar to passive partly protected devices active partly protected devices implement one or more of the above mentioned countermeasures. Additionally, they implement improved tamper-resistance measures compared to passive partly protected devices. Unlike passive devices, active devices can react immediately to a detected intrusion attempt. This is an advantage over passive devices, hence active partly protected devices are able to provide a higher security level than passive partly protected devices.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-8.3.3" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>8.3.3 Tamper resistant pervasive devices</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Tamper resistant devices are the most sophisticated devices in our classification scheme. They are comparable to security level 4 devices defined in FIPS 140-2 with regard to physical security issues. In comparison to partly protected devices, which typically implement only a few of the aforementioned countermeasures, tamper resistant devices aim to thwart any known attacks, even attacks from funded organisations (class 3 attackers). Therefore, tamper resistant devices usually implement more of the above mentioned countermeasures than partly protected devices. In addition to the countermeasures mentioned in Section 8.3.2, tamper resistant devices possess environmental failure protection mechanism or undergo environmental failure testing. In particular, FIPS 140-2 security level 4 requires the implementation of voltage and temperature sensors. Additionally clock frequency sensors improve the security level. If a device is operated in unusual environmental conditions outside of its standard operation range, this can cause abnormal behaviour, which may result in a security risk [16]. Environmental failure protection mechanisms include:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>internal voltage sensors</li>
      <li>clock frequency sensors</li>
      <li>temperature sensors</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Power glitch attacks use under- and over-voltages to cause abnormal behavior of the device. Internal voltage sensors protect the device against these kinds of attacks. Similar to power glitch attacks, clock glitch attacks use a higher frequency to cause abnormal behavior of the device. Furthermore, at a very low clock frequency it is possible to make a static analysis of the device. Clock frequency sensors protect the device from these attacks. Static RAM contents can persist for seconds to minutes after power is removed, when the temperature is below -20&deg;C. An adversary could use this fact to read out RAM content like secret keys. Furthermore, very high temperatures can cause failures, which may be used for attacks. Temperature sensors aim at this kind of attacks. A high security level is a basic requirement for tamper resistant devices, hence they are the most expensive devices in our classification scheme, assumed that devices of the same processing power are compared. The following list summarizes the main characteristics of partly protected devices:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>most sophisticated devices</li>
      <li>high cost</li>
      <li>security is a basic requirement</li>
      <li>many of the aforementioned countermeasures are implemented</li>
      <li>environmental protection mechanisms are implemented or the devices undergo environmental testing before deployment</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As already mentioned in Section 8.3.2, an adversary can attack a device without any concern as long as it is not switched on, because tamper-detection and environmental failure protection mechanisms can only work, when the device is powered on. Passive tamper resistant devices should therefore have been tested for environmental failure before deployment. The temperature to be tested should range from -100&deg;C to +200&deg;C, the voltage &quot;should range from the smallest negative voltage (with respect to ground) that causes the zeroization of the electronic devices or circuitry, including reversing the polarity of the voltages.&quot; [160]. A wide spread example for passive tamper resistant devices are sophisticated smart cards with controllers like the Infineon SLE88CX720P and SLE66C24PE [109, 110]. In comparison to passive tamper resistant devices, active tamper resistant devices can take full advantage of environmental failure protection mechanisms, because they can continuously monitor the operating voltage and temperature of the device. As soon as the sensors detect unusual environmental conditions of fluctuations, tamper response mechanisms must be triggered. FIPS 140-2 gives two alternatives for tamper-responding mechanisms. Either the device is shut-down or all critical security parameters are zeroized immediately. Examples for active tamper resistant devices are secure hardware modules used for communication between embassies or encryption devices for telecommunication.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we evaluate the proposed device classes with regard to security issues. Starting with unprotected pervasive devices in Section 8.4.1, we evaluate partly protected pervasive devices in Section 8.4.2 and tamper resistant pervasive devices in Section 8.4.3.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Unprotected devices are developed under tight cost constraints, hence they are not supposed to implement any countermeasures against physical attacks. Once an attacker can achieve unsupervised physical access to an unprotected device, she can try to tamper it with any of the above mentioned local attacks. Neither expensive equipment nor outstanding knowledge about the system is required for an attack of this device class. A clever outsider (class I attacker) may spend up to 5,000 EUR for the required (second hand) equipment. Hence, even class I attacker (clever outsiders) are supposed to be able to break unprotected pervasive devices.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-8.4.2" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>8.4.2 Evaluation of partly protected pervasive devices</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Partly protected devices implement one or more of the following countermeasures: top-metal sensor meshes, light-sensors, glue logic, noise generators, internal bus hardware encryption, and password restricted software access to internal memory. Anderson <em>et al.</em> state, that &quot;no single low-cost defence technology can protect a device against attacks&quot; [7]. Anyway, if countermeasures are prudent implemented, they can significantly raise the time and effort (red: cost) an attacker has to spend to physically attack a single device. Furthermore, sophisticated and, hence, expensive equipment is required, which will ultimately exclude class I attackers. Beside this, countermeasures aim to make life hard for class II attackers and expensive for class III attackers [6]. Passive devices are in general more vulnerable to physical attacks than active devices, because their countermeasures need to be powered on to work. This delay provides a time window, where the adversary may bypass the countermeasures before she powers the device to read out critical security parameters. Therefore it is more expensive for class II and class III attackers to break an active device rather than a passive device.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-8.4.3" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>8.4.3 Evaluation of tamper resistant pervasive devices</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In addition to the countermeasures mentioned in the last section, tamper resistant devices implement environmental failure protection mechanisms or undergo environmental failure detection. Environmental failure protection mechanisms include: internal voltage sensors, clock frequency sensors, and temperature sensors. Anderson and Kuhn refer to a senior agency official and a senior scientist at a leading semiconductor manufacturer stating the following: &quot;chip contents cannot be kept from a capable motivated opponent; at most one can impose cost and delay&quot; [7]. Because passive tamper resistant devices provide a time window where an adversary may bypass the countermeasures and the environmental failure protection mechanisms, we think that these devices can be broken by a class III (funded organisations) opponent. By contrast, active tamper resistant devices can implement more sophisticated tamper-detection mechanisms, which will react immediately to a detected attack. This results in a higher security level and, hence, even for class III attackers it is much more expensive to break an active tamper resistant device. Note that content of static RAM, if stored for a long period, may be burned in and, hence, easily be read out.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As we have pointed out in this Section, the security level of a cryptographic implementation is a matter of costs and it is very expensive to deter class II and class III attackers. Since a large share of the envisioned applications of low-cost RFID tags protects low-price values, also a low-cost security solution is sufficient. In particular for many cases it might be sufficient to deter class I attackers or raise the cost to break a single device above the value of the protected application. Therefore in the following we concentrate on non-invasive passive attacks, <em>i.e.</em> side-channel attacks, because they only require low-cost equipment and can be mounted without insider knowledge.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Side channel cryptanalysis has emerged as a serious threat for smart cards and other types of pervasive devices performing cryptographic operations. It was demonstrated in a number of publications that side channel attacks are an extremely powerful and practical tool for breaking unprotected (or insufficiently protected) implementations of crypto systems. These attacks exploit the fact that the execution of a cryptographic algorithm on a physical device leaks information about sensitive data (<em>e.g.</em> secret keys) involved in the computations. Though these attacks have been discovered accidently already in 1943 [167], it took more than 50 years for the first publication of power analysis attacks in 1999 [131]. Many sources of side channel information have been discovered in recent years, including the timing characteristics of a cryptographic algorithm [130], as well as deliberately introduced computational faults [16, 27], but most notably are power analysis attacks [131], which evolved to an own scientific sub-field with an ever increasing amount of publications. <em>Simple Power Analysis (SPA)</em> uses the leaked information from a single computation, while <em>Differential Power Analysis (DPA)</em> utilizes statistical methods to evaluate the information observed from multiple computations [131]. Currently, there exists no perfect protection against DPA attacks. However, by applying appropriate countermeasures, it is possible to make the attacker's task more difficult and expensive. These countermeasures can be implemented at the architectural, algorithmic, or cell level. In the remainder we focus on the latter two. Starting with an overview of countermeasures at the algorithmic level, we then discuss countermeasures at the cell level.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-8.5.1" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>8.5.1 Countermeasures at the algorithmic level</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The two most common countermeasure principles against side channel attacks at the algorithmic level are <em>hiding</em> and <em>masking</em> [147]. This Section provides a brief overview over implementation possibilities of these fundamental principals.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-misc-22" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8"><strong>Hiding</strong></h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Hiding</em> is a general term for countermeasures that aim to break the link between the power consumption of a cryptographic device and the processed data value [147]. There are two hiding approaches: either the device has a random power consumption such that in each clock cycle a random amount of power is consumed or exactly the same amount of power is dissipated in each cycle. The latter approach tries to implement single operations in a way that each operation with all data values consumes the same amount of data. However, both goals are not possible in practice, but there are several proposal to approach this goal. In the following two proposals that use time de-synchronization are shortly presented. Subsequently two proposal that reduce the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are presented.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Random insertion of dummy cycles</strong> This approach tries to de-synchronize different power traces of the cryptographic device. It randomly inserts dummy operations before, during and after the execution of the algorithm. For an attacker it is important to have aligned traces, such that correlating peaks add up. The random insertion of dummy operations de-aligns measured power traces and hence more traces are required for a successful attack. The drawback of this approach is its longer execution time and hence its lower throughput.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Shuffling</strong> Many cryptographic algorithms use operations that only modify a part of the internal state at once. S-boxes are a good example for these kind of operations. In the case of AES and PRESENT 16 similar S-boxes are applied in parallel to the state. Note that AES has an internal data state of 128 bits and 8 &times; 8 S-boxes while PRESENT has an internal state of 64 bits and 4 &times; 4 S-boxes. In a serialized implementation, where in each clock cycle only one chunk of 4 bits (in case of PRESENT) is processed by the S-box, 16 cycles are required for the whole state. Usually the 4-bit chunks are processed subsequently and&mdash;more important&mdash;in the same order for each round of the algorithm. Shuffling randomizes the sequence of similar operations with different random number for each execution and round of the algorithm. As a result the power traces of such a protected implementation are similarly randomized as by the insertion of dummy operations, but the throughput does not suffer. Unfortunately only a limited amount of operations are shuffle-able in an algorithm. However, in practice both countermeasures are often combined.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Increasing the noise</strong> There are two possibilities to reduce the SNR: increasing the noise or reducing the signal. To increase the noise especially for hardware implementations there exist a variety of different approaches. The most straightforward approach is to perform several independent operations in parallel. A pipelined parallelized implementation of a cryptographic algorithm performs several encryptions of different&mdash;and hence independent&mdash;plaintexts at the same time. Consequently it is much harder to attack a parallelized implementation compared to a round-based or serialized implementation. Dedicated noise generators are another approach to increase the noise. These circuits are solely implemented to generate random noise thus increasing  <span class="math">Var(P_{sn})</span>  and hence lower the SNR. Disadvantageous on both approaches is the introduction of significant overhead in terms of area and power consumption.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Reducing the signal</strong> In order to lower the SNR it is also possible to decrease the signal. It turned out that this a challenging task, because even the smallest deviations in the power consumption of different operations can be exploited by DPA. However, dedicated logic styles try to flatten the power consumption at the cell level. The goal is have a constant power consumption for all different cells such that the overall power consumption is constant. Finally some approaches filter the power consumption of the cryptographic device in order to remove all data- and operation-dependent components.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-misc-23" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Masking</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Masking</em> is a countermeasure that aims to release the link between the intermediate values of a cryptographic algorithm and its power consumption by randomization. Masking can be applied on the algorithmic level, <em>i.e.</em> there is no need to change the power characteristics of the device. In <em>Boolean masking</em> the intermediate value  <span class="math">v_m</span>  is bit-wise XORed with the mask, such that  <span class="math">v_m = v \\oplus m</span>  and in <em>arithmetic masking</em> an arbitrary arithmetic operator is used despite the bit-wise XOR. In the remainder of this Thesis we focus on <em>Boolean masking</em> and consequently the term <em>masking</em> refers to <em>Boolean masking</em> unless it is denoted otherwise.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The idea behind masking is to blind the input at the very beginning of the cipher with a random value (the mask) and then process the masked instead of the unmasked value. As a result, the side channel leakage of all intermediate, key-dependent values is not correlated to the unmasked values. Hence, side channel attacks can be effectively thwarted [204]. Finally, in the so-called <em>mask correction</em> step, the mask has to be removed in order to output the correct ciphertext. For this purpose the mask has to be processed by similar operations as the data or key state. For linear operations, e.g. the permutation layer in PRESENT, this is simple to implement, because  <span class="math">P(x \\oplus m) = P(x) \\oplus m</span>  holds. However, for non-linear operations such as S-boxes it is not trivial, because  <span class="math">S(x \\oplus m) \\neq S(x) \\oplus S(m)</span> . Therefore, the masked S-box  <span class="math">S_{m_1}</span>  has to be adapted for each possible value of the mask  <span class="math">m_1</span> , such that  <span class="math">S_{m_1}(x \\oplus m_1) = S(x) \\oplus m_1</span>  holds. This enables the mask to <em>flow</em> through the S-box, such that it can be unmasked easily by XORing the mask to the output again. Figure 8.1(a) depicts a schematic of such a modified S-box.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, if the mask has to be updated in every round, the S-box can be further modified, such that  <span class="math">S_{m_2}(x\\oplus m&#x27;)=S(x)\\oplus m_d</span>  holds. Now the input value  <span class="math">x\\oplus m&#x27;</span>  of the S-box is concealed by a different mask (m') than the output of the S-box  <span class="math">(m_d)</span> . Figure 8.1(b) depicts a schematic of the masked S-box-m2 entity, which takes  <span class="math">x\\oplus m&#x27;</span> , m' and  <span class="math">m_d</span>  as inputs and outputs  <span class="math">S(x)\\oplus m_d</span> . We advised the espresso tool to provide four Boolean output functions according to the specifications. Hence S-box-m1 can be seen as an  <span class="math">8\\times 4</span>  S-box and S-box-m2 as a  <span class="math">12\\times 4</span>  S-box.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 8.1: Schematics of single and double masked PRESENT S-boxes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">After synthesis the masked S-boxes Sm<sup>1</sup> and Sm<sup>2</sup> require 52 GE and 57 GE, which is about twice the size of a standard PRESENT S-box (28 GE).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Both modified S-boxes S-box-m1 and S-box-m2 first remove the mask form the input, process the unmasked value, and then mask the output again. This is an effective countermeasures against side channel attacks that exploit the leakage of flip-flops, such as [158, 157]. However, both S-boxes may be susceptible to side channel attacks that exploit the leakage of the combinatorial parts (toggle-count model).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Masking is in fact a (2,2) secret sharing scheme [206, 31], where both shares of the secret are required to proceed. Unfortunately, higher order DPA attacks (HODPA) can break basic masking schemes. However, Chari <em>et al.</em> have shown in [41] that up to n-th order DPA attacks can be prevented by using n masks. Following this direction, Nikova <em>et al.</em> extend the idea of masking with more than two shares in [168]. They show that non-linear functions implemented in such a way, achieve provable security against first-order DPA attacks and also resists higherorder attacks that are based on a comparison of mean power consumption. Estimations of a hardware implementation of these ideas are presented in [169].</p>

      <h4 id="sec-8.5.2" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>8.5.2 Countermeasures at the cell level</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Sense Amplifier Based Logic (SABL), which is a Dual-Rail Precharge (DRP) logic, has been proposed by Tiri <em>et al.</em> [224] as the first DPA countermeasure at the cell level. In fact, in theory using a full-custom design tool enables to equalize the load capacitances of each couple of complementary logic signals and hence to make the power consumption independent of the processed data. Afterwards, Wave Dynamic Differential Logic (WDDL) [226] has been introduced in order to avoid the usage of full-custom design tools especially for the routing process. Since some place and route methods such as [93, 227] were proposed to diminish the load imbalances of complementary signals, the data-dependent time of evaluation and the memory effect of WDDL cells leave it still vulnerable to DPA attacks [216, 147].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Although it has been shown that masking at the cell level can not prevent the information leakage because of the presence of glitches [148], its combination with precharge logics led to Random Switching Logic (RSL) [217] in order to equalize the circuit transition probability. However, Tiri and Schaumont [225] showed that the single mask-bit in RSL just add one bit of entropy. On the other hand, in order to use semi-custom design tools without routing constrains, Masked Dual-Rail Precharge Logic (MDPL) [182] was introduced. It works similar to WDDL and employs a single mask-bit to nullify the effect of load imbalances. Moreover, Dual-Rail Random Switching Logic (DRSL) [42] was proposed to be the dual-rail version of RSL and to avoid the need of a central module to control the precharge signals.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Suzuki <em>et al.</em> showed that MDPL is susceptible to the early propagation effect [215]. The practical evaluation of the SCARD prototype chip<sup>2</sup> proved that the early propagation effect which resulted in a vulnerability of CMOS circuits also exists for MDPL cells [181]. In order to cope with the early propagation issues, the designers of MDPL introduced a so called Evaluation-Precharge Detection Unit (EPDU), which consists of three (CMOS) AND gates and two (CMOS) OR gates. The EPDU is applied to all improved MDPL (iMDPL) gates, hence it is not surprising that the area requirements for iMDPL gates increased significantly compared to MDPL gates.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Gierlichs [79] presented an attack on MDPL that exploits a deviation in the mask bit distribution and unbalanced dual-rails in the target cell. In order to mount this attack an adversary requires detailed knowledge on the layout-level of the device under attack. However, in practice this information is not publicly available or requires insider knowledge or expensive equipment and time-consuming efforts, such as reverse-engineering to gain it.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">At that time, Schaumont and Tiri [202] showed that already slightly unbalanced complementary wires can be exploited to mount classical DPA attacks after only a simple filtering operation. Contrary to Gierlichs they did not exploit the unbalanced wires of the mask bit signal, but rather use only the unbalanced dual-rail wires of the logical signals.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that the attacks of Gierlichs and of Schaumont/Tiri can also be mounted on circuits built in iMDPL, but again require unbalanced wires and detailed knowledge of the device under attack. Therefore both attacks assume a rather strong attacker model. Furthermore, both attacks and also the attacks by Suzuki <em>et al.</em> [215] and Popp <em>et al.</em> [181] exploit leakage of the combinatorial part of a circuit. Contrary to this, Moradi <em>et al.</em> presented an attack on special circuits built in MDPL and DRSL that exploits the leakage of the underlying flip-flops [158]. They gain the Hamming distance of the mask bit with a Simple Power Analysis (SPA) and subsequently attack the circuit with a Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) [35]. Note that the success rate of any SPA strongly depends on the architecture of the attacked device. However, this attack is focused on a special type of flip-flops and a special architecture of the circuit. In a followup work [157] Moradi <em>et al.</em> analyzed the information leakage of CMOS flip-flops as well as the flip-flops of some known DPA-resistant logic styles. Using a modified Hamming distance</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>2</sup>During the SCARD (Side-Channel Analysis Resistant Design Flow, www.scard-project.eu) project a prototype chip was built, that contains amongst other components three AES co-processors built in CMOS, a DRP logic, and MDPL.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">model to find the leakage of the CMOS flip-flops used in masked flip-flops their attack does not require any knowledge of the layout of the device<sup>3</sup> nor unbalanced wires and hence can be mounted even by class 1 attackers (clever outsiders). Their attack works even if a masked dual-rail ASIC has perfectly balanced wires.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Yet, perfectly balanced loads can never be achieved in practice because electrical effects will always cause different wire capacitances, even when the routing is done manually in a fullcustom design process. Therefore, it is questionable whether dual-rail logic approaches can provide enough resistance against side channel attacks in practice. Hence, the design of side channel countermeasures at the cell level remains an open research problem.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this Section the costs of side channel countermeasures for lightweight hardware and software implementations of PRESENT-80 are assessed. The goal is to provide figures that estimate the additional costs in terms of area and timing when implementing side channel countermeasures. First a masked serialized PRESENT-80/4 hardware architecture is discussed in Section 8.6.1 and subsequently a masked software implementation on a 4-bit microcontroller is assessed in Section 8.6.2.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-8.6.1" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>8.6.1 Cost overhead estimations for a masked serialized hardware implementations of</strong> PRESENT</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This section estimates the overhead costs of a masked serialized hardware implementation of PRESENT compared to a non-masked implementation. In a masked implementation no two values with the same mask should be stored in registers with a similar leakage model in subsequent clock cycles [147]. This is especially important for lightweight hardware implementations, because the register are reduced to a minimum in order to save area. This in particular means that as few registers or flip-flops are used as possible, which implies that updated values replace current values. For round-based implementations it is immediately clear that in each cycle a new mask has to be applied to all data state and key state bits. A serialized PRESENT-80/4 implementations requires a new 4-bit mask for every 4-bit chunk of the data and the key state in every round. Hence, regardless of the architecture, a masked PRESENT-80 implementation requires in total 32 &middot; (64 + 80) = 4, 608 mask bits, <em>i.e.</em> random bits.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 8.2 depicts a proposal for a double masked serialized PRESENT-80 architecture. It consists of a serialized PRESENT-80/4 implementation without the S-boxes component (1, 038 GE), because it was replaced by S-box-m2 in the datapath and by S-box-m1 in the key schedule. The initial data are input as sixteen 4-bit words W = w<sup>15</sup> . . . w0. These words are masked with random 4-bit words md,i &isin;<sup>R</sup> {0, 1} <sup>4</sup> before they are stored in the state registers, hence the data state consists of the following sixteen 4-bit words wm,<sup>15</sup> . . . wm,<sup>0</sup> where wm,i = w<sup>i</sup> &oplus; md,i for 0 &le; i &le; 15. Similarly, the initial key K = k<sup>19</sup> . . . k<sup>0</sup> is input in 4-bit words and masked with random 4-bit words mk,j &isin;<sup>R</sup> {0, 1} 4 . Consequently the key state consists of the following twenty 4 bit words km,<sup>19</sup> . . . km,<sup>0</sup> where km,j = k<sup>j</sup> &oplus;mk,j for 0 &le; j &le; 19. For this initial masking step two additional 4-bit XORs with two inputs (18.64 GE) are required.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>3</sup>Of course, any power analysis attack needs a brief knowledge about the architecture and intermediate values.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Please note that in our notation the masks of the current round are denoted with  <span class="math">m_{d,i}</span>  and  <span class="math">m_{k,j}</span>  while the values of the masks from the previous round are denoted with  <span class="math">m&#x27;_{d,i}</span>  and  <span class="math">m&#x27;_{k,j}</span> . Therefore, after each round the following transitions occurs</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$m&#x27;_{d,i} \\leftarrow m_{d,i}, \\text{for } 0 \\leq i \\leq 15</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$m&#x27;_{k,j} \\leftarrow m_{k,j}</span>$
, for  <span class="math">0 \\le j \\le 19</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and consequently also</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$w_{m&#x27;,15}\\ldots w_{m,0} \\leftarrow w_{m,15}\\ldots w_{m&#x27;,0}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$k_{m&#x27;,19} \\dots k_{m,0} \\leftarrow k_{m,19} \\dots k_{m&#x27;,0}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">w_{m&#x27;,i} = w_i \\oplus m&#x27;_{d,i}</span>  for  <span class="math">0 \\le i \\le 15</span>  and  <span class="math">k_{m&#x27;,i} = k_i \\oplus m&#x27;_{k,i}</span>  for  <span class="math">0 \\le i \\le 19</span> . This implies that the mask bits have to be stored for one round, which requires 144 additional flip-flops (864 GE).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">After initialization, the first 4-bit word of the data state  <span class="math">w_{m&#x27;,0}</span>  is XORed with the corresponding key nibble  <span class="math">k_{m&#x27;,0}</span>  and subsequently processed by the S-box-m2 before it is stored again in the data state register. As mentioned above the data state has to be concealed with a different mask prior to storing, which is performed by the S-box-m2 component. The S-box input  <span class="math">x_{m&#x27;,i}</span>  consists of the XOR sum of the masked data state word  <span class="math">w_{m&#x27;,i}</span>  and the corresponding masked key state word  <span class="math">k_{m&#x27;,i}</span> , i.e.  <span class="math">x_{m&#x27;,i} = w_{m&#x27;,i} \\oplus k_{m&#x27;,i} = (w_i \\oplus m&#x27;_{d,i}) \\oplus (k_i \\oplus m&#x27;_{k,i}) = x_i \\oplus m&#x27;_{i}</span> , where  <span class="math">x_i = w_i \\oplus k_i</span>  and  <span class="math">m&#x27;_i = m&#x27;_{d,i} \\oplus m&#x27;_{k,i}</span> . Recall that S-box-m2 was designed such that  <span class="math">S_{m_2}(x \\oplus m&#x27;) = S(x) \\oplus m_d</span> , hence the output of S-box-m2 is  <span class="math">S(w_i \\oplus k_i) \\oplus m_{d,i}</span> . In order to provide  <span class="math">m&#x27;_i</span>  a 4-bit XOR with two inputs is required (9.32 GE).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the same cycle the key state word is fed back into the key state register. In order to update the key mask, one 4-bit XOR with three inputs (18.68 GE) is required that XORs  <span class="math">m_{k,i}</span>  and  <span class="math">m&#x27;_{k,i}</span>  to the masked key word  <span class="math">k_{m&#x27;,i}</span> . Therefore the key state is updated with  <span class="math">k_{m,i} = k_{m&#x27;,i} \\oplus m&#x27;_{k,i} \\oplus m_{k,i} = (k_i \\oplus m&#x27;_{k,i}) \\oplus m&#x27;_{k,i} \\oplus m_{k,i} = k_i \\oplus m_{k,i}</span> . After 16 iterations all data state words have been processed but four key state words have not. Therefore four additional clock cycles, during which the data state sleeps, are required. The permutation layer is processed in a single clock cycle on the complete data state. In total the execution of one round would require 16+4+1=21 clock cycles. After repetition of 31 times in the final round the output has to be unmasked. For this purpose a 4 bit XOR with two inputs is required (9.32 GE).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Please note that the S-boxes unit replaces the S-box component of the serialized PRESENT-80/4 implementation while all other units from Table 8.1 require additional area. The S-box component of the plain PRESENT-80/4 implementation consists of a 4-bit MUX (9.32 GE) and an S-box (28 GE), which sums up to 37.2 GE. Consequently the contribution of the S-boxes unit to the overhead was reduced by 37 GE and in the following Table 8.2 only the difference was taken into account. As one can see a masked implementation requires less than double the area of a non-masked one and is slightly above the 2,000 GE barrier. Similar to the plain implementation, the majority of the area is required for storage, because for every data and key state bit also a mask bit has to be stored. The timing overhead is caused by the fact that the key state is 16 bits longer than the data state. Since the mask bits are provided in 4-bit chunks, 4 additional clock cycles are required per round in order to update the mask of the key state. Since also the plain implementation requires 20 clock cycles to read in the key at the beginning of each new message block, this overhead occurs only during 31 rounds. In total  <span class="math">31 \\cdot 4 = 124</span>  additional clock cycles would be required for a masked implementation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 8.3: Code size and cycle count overhead of a masked PRESENT-80 implementation on the ATAM893-D 4-bit microcontroller.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">promising, a real ASIC should be manufactured and attacked in order to assess the security level more realistically.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Section 5.4.2 a software implementation of PRESENT-80 on a 4-bit microcontroller was presented. This implementation was strengthened using Boolean masking in a straightforward manner and a coding style that achieves a constant runtime. Further implementation details can be found in [234]. Table 8.3 shows the performance of the masked implementation in comparison with the non-masked implementation. As one can see the masked implementation requires more than three times of ROM while the stack requirements stay the same. This is mainly caused by the masked S-box, which is 16 times larger than the unmasked S-box. At the same time the initialization phase is nearly three time as long and the encryption of one data blocks requires 66% more clock cycles. However, with 92, 498 clock cycles the masked implementation can encrypt one message block below 200 ms when clocked at 500 KHz, where the current consumption is still below 10 &micro;A (see Section 5.4.2).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The structural problem of most of todays SCA countermeasures is that they significantly increase the area, timing and power consumption of the implemented algorithm compared to a non-protected implementation. Furthermore, many countermeasures require random numbers, hence also a TRNG or a PRNG<sup>4</sup> has to be available. Since this will also increase the cost of an implementation of the algorithm, it will delay the break-even point and hence the mass deployment of some applications. For ultra-constrained applications, such as passive RFID tags, some countermeasures pose an impregnable barrier, because the power consumption of the protected implementation is much higher than what is available.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Power optimization techniques are an important tool for lightweight implementations of specific pervasive applications and might ease the aforementioned problem. On the one hand they also strengthen implementations against side channel attacks, because they lower the power consumption (the signal), which decreases the signal to noise ratio (SNR). However, on the other hand power saving techniques also <em>weaken</em> the resistance against side channel attacks. One consequence of the power minimization goal is that in the optimal case only those parts of the data path are active that process the relevant information. Furthermore, the width of the data path, <em>i.e.</em> the amount of bits that are processed at one point in time, is reduced by serialization. This however implies that the algorithmic noise is reduced to a minimum, which reduces the amount of required power traces for a successful side channel attack. Even worse, the serialized architecture allows the adversary a divide-and-conquer approach which further reduces the complexity of a side channel attack. Summarizing, it can be concluded that lightweight implementations greatly enhance the success probability of a side channel attack. The practical side channel attack [67] on <em>KeeLoq</em> applications [171] impressively underline this conclusions.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A different approach that combines power saving and SCA resistance is taken by Khatir and Moradi. They propose to use <em>adiabatic logic</em> styles as a countermeasure against SCA attacks [121]. Adiabatic logic uses a time-varying voltage source and its slopes of transition are slowed down. This reduces the energy dissipation of each transition to:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$E_{Adiabatic} = \\xi \\frac{RC}{T} C V_{dd}^2</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where T denotes the charging/discharging time, Vdd the voltage swing value &xi; is the shaping factor for the power wave form. Recall that the energy dissipation of a CMOS circuit is given by the following equation:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$E_{CMOS} = \\frac{1}{2}CV_{dd}^2</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where C denotes the associated capacitance and Vdd the supply voltage. In short the idea of adiabatic logic is to use a trapezoidal power-clock voltage rather than fixed supply voltage. As a consequence the power consumption of a circuit is reduced while at the same time its resistance against side-channel attacks is greatly enhanced. Especially for pervasive devices adiabatic logic styles seem to be a promising SCA countermeasure and future publications on this topic will be worth reading.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As we have pointed out in this Thesis, the attacker model is different for pervasive devices compared to traditional computers. Especially the access to and the control over the pervasive devices opens the whole field of physical attacks for a potential adversary. On the other side, pervasive devices are typically very constrained in terms of computing capabilities, memory capacitance, and available power supply. These requirements lead to the need of specifically tailored security solutions for pervasive devices. Furthermore, due to the cost-constraints inherent in mass-deployment always the cheapest, <em>i.e.</em> most constrained, device that fulfills the requirements will be chosen for deployment. Consequently, there is a constant or even increasing demand for lightweight cryptography.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Chapter 2 we introduced the notation, metrics and further background information as well as the design approaches and trade-offs for lightweight cryptography. We started with the approach of implementing a standardized algorithm with the optimization goal of minimal hardware requirements in Chapter 3. We chose DES, because it is one of the very few algorithms that was designed with a strong focus on hardware efficiency and is probably the best investigated algorithm. As a result we presented the smallest known hardware implementation of DES in Section 3.4.1. The next step was to have a closer look on the hardware requirements of the single components and it turned out that the substitution layer of DES is very demanding in terms of area requirements. Consequently we thought about further optimizations and we decided to slightly and very carefully change the substitution layer of DES. The literature study revealed that so far there was no DES variant published that uses a single S-box repeated eight times. Therefore we studied the design criteria of DES' S-boxes and the various publications that deal with cryptographic properties of S-boxes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Section 3.3 we stated eight conditions which a single S-box has to fulfill in order to be resistant against certain types of linear and differential cryptanalyses, and the Davies-Murphy attack. We presented a strengthened S-box, which is used in the single S-box DES variants DESL and DESXL. Furthermore, we showed, that a differential cryptanalysis with characteristics similar to the characteristics used by Biham and Shamir in [25] is not feasible anymore. We also showed, that DESL is more resistant against the most promising types of linear cryptanalysis than DES due to the improved non-linearity of the S-box. In order to expand the key space we also proposed DESXL, which is a DESX variant based on DESL rather than on DES. Due to the low current consumption and the small chip size required for our DESL design, it is especially suited for resource limited applications, for example RFID tags and wireless sensor nodes. DESL and DESXL are two examples for the approach where a well trusted algorithm is slightly and very carefully modified. In order to gain an even more hardware efficient implementation of a cryptographic algorithm, it is required to design a new lightweight algorithm from scratch.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This approach was followed in Chapter 4, where the new lightweight block cipher PRESENT was proposed. Well-known design principles (substitution-permutation network) were used to optimize its structure and every component for lightweight hardware implementation with a minimal area footprint, hence so to say PRESENT is an <em>engineered</em> cipher. The design philosophy of PRESENT was to keep it straight and simple wherever possible, because this eases implementation, while at the same time encourages researchers to scrutinize the security of PRESENT. In Section 4.6 we have presented our cryptanalytic results that show that PRESENT resists all (at the time of publication) known cryptanalytic attacks. Furthermore we also have discussed recent cryptanalytic results from other researchers that to some extent propose new cryptanalytic techniques. Interestingly all results underline the strength of PRESENT against these attacks.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this Thesis we have also intensively explored implementations of PRESENT on a wide variety of different platforms, ranging from ASICs and FPGAs, over hardware-software co-design approaches to plain software implementations. The serialized ASIC implementation constitutes with 1, 000 GE the smallest published ASIC implementation of a cryptographic algorithm with a reasonable security level. Also the FPGA-implementation leads to a very compact result (202 slices), while providing a maximum frequency of 254 MHz. ASIC and FPGA figures highlight that though PRESENT was designed with a minimal hardware footprint in mind, <em>i.e.</em> targeted for low-cost devices such as RFIDs, PRESENT is well suited for high-speed and high-throughput applications. Especially its hardware efficiency, <em>i.e.</em> the throughput per slice or GE, respectively, is noteworthy. Furthermore, interestingly the old-fashioned Boolean minimization tool <em>espresso</em> lead to an FPGA implementation that was significantly smaller than a standard LUT based implementation. Besides this, we have also discussed recently published HW/SW codesign implementation results from other researchers that all underline PRESENTs suitability for low-cost and low-power applications that only process small amounts of data.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">On the software side we exploited the lightweight structure of PRESENT and especially its 4-bit S-boxes by implementing PRESENT on a 4-bit microcontroller. To the best of our knowledge up to now there are no implementation results of cryptographic algorithms for 4-bit microcontrollers published. In Chapter 5 we have closed this gap and provided the first implementation results of this kind. We therefore presented a proof-of-concept that state-of-the-art cryptography is feasible on ultra-constrained 4-bit microcontrollers. Our implementation draws a current of 6.7 &micro;A at a supply voltage of 1.8V and a frequency of 500 KHz. Together with the observation that the processing of one data block requires less than 200 ms we conclude that this implementation is interesting for passively powered RFID tags.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">While compact hash functions are often proposed in protocols for RFID tags, there are currently no sufficiently compact candidates to hand. In Chapter 6 we have explored the possibility of building a hash function out of a block cipher such as PRESENT. We have described hash functions that offer 64- and 128-bit outputs based on current design strategies. For their parameter sets these are the most compact hash function candidates available today. In particular, H-PRESENT-128 requires around 4, 000 GE, which is similar to the best known AES implementation and about 50% smaller than the best reported MD5 implementation. At the same time, H-PRESENT-128 requires between 20&ndash;30 <em>times</em> fewer clock cycles than compact AES and MD5 implementations, giving it a major time-area advantage. Obviously 128-bit hash functions are relevant for applications where a security-performance trade-off is warranted. To obtain larger hash outputs there are severe complications and we suspect that dedicated designs could be more appropriate.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Lightweight public-key cryptography was investigated in Chapter 7. There we have described a proof-of-concept prototype board that simulates an RFID tag and contains a crypto-GPS ASIC. Several well-known optimizations of crypto-GPS have been described and three different hardware architectures of the crypto-GPS scheme have been presented. The implementation figures show that public key cryptography with a security level equivalent to 80 bits can be implemented with as few as 2, 181 GE including also memory and PRNG components. For 375 additional GE a more than 6 times faster implementation (1, 696 vs. 10, 723 clock cycles) can be realized. Both of these variants have a fixed secret s and an implementation with a variable secret s requires 3, 976 GE and takes 1, 696 clock cycles.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The area and power minimization goals of lightweight cryptographic implementations also bear security risks with regard to physical attacks. While on the one hand power saving techniques reduce the signal, which in turn decreases the signal to noise ratio (SNR), on the other hand together with a serialized datapath they decrease the algorithmic noise to a minimum, thus increasing the SNR. This in turn greatly increase the success probability of side channel attacks. Therefore in Chapter 8 we classified pervasive devices with respect to physical security aspects. Furthermore, we have estimated the costs of masking for lightweight hardware and software implementations of PRESENT. One observation from previously published countermeasures against side channel attacks is that each countermeasure introduces a significant overhead in area, clock cycles, and/or power consumption. Even more interesting, though the <em>relative</em> overhead stays the same for different algorithms, the <em>total</em> overhead in terms of area and power consumption (and also the costs) decreases with a more efficient algorithm. Especially with regard to the adapted Moore's law this can be a strong argument for or against a certain algorithm. Under this assumption area and power minimization becomes ever more important and adiabatic logic seems to be a very promising logic style for pervasive devices.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In short, the implementation results that have been described in this Thesis lead to the following conclusions:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>(1) The widespread assumption that stream-ciphers can be implemented more efficiently in hardware compared to block ciphers does not hold anymore, since the block cipher PRESENT requires only 1, 000 GE.</li>
      <li>(2) Consequently, hash functions with a digest size of 64 or 128 bits that are based on block ciphers can be implemented efficiently in hardware as well. Though it is not easy to obtain lightweight hash functions with a digest size of greater or equal to 160 bits. Given the required parameters, it is very unlikely that the NIST SHA-3 hash competition will lead to a lightweight approach. Hence, lightweight hash functions with a digest size of greater or equal to 160 bits remain an open research problem.</li>
      <li>(3) It is possible to implement the asymmetric cryptographic identification scheme crypto-GPS with only 2, 181 GE including storage and PRNG. However, crypto-GPS has a limited (though configurable) amount of pre-computed coupons. It would be interesting to see lightweight implementations of asymmetric identification schemes that do not have this constraints.</li>

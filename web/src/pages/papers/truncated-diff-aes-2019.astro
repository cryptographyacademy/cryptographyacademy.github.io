        Distinguishers on round-reduced AES have attracted considerable
        attention in the recent years. While the number of rounds
        covered in key-recovery attacks did not increase, subspace,
        yoyo, mixture-differential, and multiple-of-<span class="math">n</span>
        cryptanalysis advanced the understanding of the properties of
        the cipher.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        For substitution-permutation networks, integral attacks are a
        suitable target for extension since they usually end after a
        linear layer sums several subcomponents. Based on results by
        Patarin, Chen et al. already observed that the expected number
        of collisions for a sum of permutations differs slightly from
        that for a random primitive. Though, their target remained
        lightweight primitives.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        The present work illustrates how the well-known integral
        distinguisher on three-round AES resembles a sum of PRPs and
        can be extended to truncated-differential distinguishers over
        4 and 5 rounds. In contrast to previous distinguishers by
        Grassi et al., our approach allows to prepend a round that
        starts from a diagonal subspace. We demonstrate how the
        prepended round can be used for key recovery with a new
        differential key-recovery attack on six-round AES. Moreover,
        we show how the prepended round can also be integrated to form
        a six-round distinguisher. For all distinguishers and the
        key-recovery attack, our results are supported by
        implementations with Cid et al.'s established Small-AES
        version. While the distinguishers do not threaten the security
        of the AES, they try to shed more light on its properties.

    <section id="sec-1" class="mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">1 Introduction</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        During the previous two decades, the Advanced Encryption
        Standard (AES) [Nat01] has withstood vast amounts of
        cryptanalysis. Besides the biclique-based accelerated
        exhaustive search [BKR11], the best-known attacks on AES-128
        in the secret-key model cover seven rounds, as had been the
        state of the art close after its announcement
        [FKL+00]. However, the community's efforts led to
        attacks with considerably reduced resources. Among the
        key-recovery attacks that cover the most rounds [BLNS18,
        DFJ13, FKL+00, MDRM10], the meet-in-the-middle
        attacks by Derbez et al. possess the lowest time and data
        complexities since 2013 [DFJ13]. Their attacks were based on
        Demirci and Selcuk's [DS08] variant of the earlier collision
        attack by Gilbert and Minier [GM00].
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        Although the number of rounds covered in key-recovery attacks
        has stagnated, the recent years were filled with research on
        distinguishers on round-reduced AES that significantly raised
        the understanding of the cipher's components. This direction
        appears promising -- metaphorically, it is comparable to
        heuristics that sometimes also have to leave a local optimum
        to improve in the long run.
      </p>

      <h3 id="sec-1.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">
        1.1 Distinguishers on Round-reduced AES
      </h3>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        <strong>Negative results</strong> paved a rocky start for the
        search for new distinguishers. Sun et al.
        [SLG+16b] proved the absence of impossible
        differentials over more than four rounds for the AES
        <em>structure</em>, which was tantamount with the absence of
        zero-correlation distinguishers over more than four rounds
        [SLR+15]. Since [SLG+16b] ignored the
        details of the AES S-box and its key schedule, there remained
        a spark of hope for longer distinguishers of those kinds. The
        works by Wang and Jin [WJ18, WJ19] extinguished this spark.
        Under the assumption of independent random round keys, they
        showed the absence of any (truncated) impossible differentials
        over more than four-round of the AES taking also the details
        of the S-box into account.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        <strong>Key-dependent Distinguishers.</strong> Despite the
        negative results, a series of works has been focusing on novel
        properties for distinguishers on fewer rounds than the best
        known attacks. First, several key-dependent distinguishers
        were crafted, e.g., the chosen-ciphertext zero-correlation
        hull on five rounds by Sun et al. [SLG+16a]
        exploited a known difference in two key bytes to cover five
        rounds. While their distinguisher required the full codebook
        when converted to the single-key model, it re-ignited the
        community's efforts on analyzing round-reduced AES.
        Subsequent works [CCM+18, GRR16, Gra18a, HCGW18]
        improved on their result and proposed further key-dependent
        results.
      </p>

      <h3 id="sec-1.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">
        1.2 Key-independent Distinguishers on Round-reduced AES
      </h3>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        Besides key-dependent results, several powerful key-independent
        distinguishers have been proposed recently. In a series of
        works [GRR16, GRR17, GR18, Gra18b], Grassi et al. outlined
        novel observations and distinguishers on five-round AES. At
        their core, [GRR17] observed a strong property dubbed
        multiple-of-<span class="math">n</span>: using all pairs from
        a diagonal space, the number of different ciphertext pairs
        that belonged to the same coset of a mixed space was always a
        multiple of <span class="math">n</span> after five rounds.
        Boura et al. [BCC19] revisited the multiple-of-<span class="math">n</span>
        property and derived similar distinguishers for further
        AES-like primitives.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        <strong>Mixture-differential Distinguishers.</strong>
        In [Gra17, Gra18b], Grassi proposed mixture-differential
        distinguishers. Mixtures are couples of pairs that start from
        a pair of plaintexts
        <span class="math">(P, P')</span> that differ in multiple
        components, say values
        <span class="math">(x, y)</span> in
        <span class="math">P</span> and
        <span class="math">(x', y')</span> in
        <span class="math">P'</span>. A second plaintext pair
        <span class="math">(P'', P''')</span> with byte values
        <span class="math">(x, y')</span> and
        <span class="math">(x', y)</span> is created from mixing the
        differing components such that the input difference remains
        invariant, and their corresponding ciphertext pairs lie in a
        coset of the same subspace.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        To the best of our knowledge, the best previously published
        distinguishers on round-reduced AES-128 in terms of minimal
        complexity are the exchange/yoyo-based proposals by Ronjom and
        Bardeh [BR19b, BR19c]. They extended their earlier yoyo
        attacks from [RBH17] and reduced the complexity to about
        <span class="math">2^&#123;88&#125;</span> encryptions and chosen
        plaintexts. Bardeh [Bar19] recently proposed a variant with
        adaptively chosen ciphertexts with
        <span class="math">2^&#123;83&#125;</span> data and time complexity.

        1.3 From Integral to Truncated-differential Distinguishers
      </h3>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        Integral Distinguishers map multi-sets of inputs that iterate
        over all values to multi-sets of outputs that are balanced.
        Traditionally, the properties of bits or bytes are either
        constant (<strong>C</strong>), iterate over all values
        (<strong>A</strong>), are balanced (<strong>B</strong>), or
        unknown (<strong>U</strong>). A traditional integral
        distinguisher usually ends directly before all parts of the
        state become unknown. For the AES, the three-round integral
        distinguisher [DKR97] that maps sets of a single active byte
        to a set of states where each byte is balanced after three
        rounds is understood well, and so is the extension to a
        distinguisher on four rounds [DKR97, FKL+00] that
        prepends a round and starts from an active diagonal.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        <strong>Extending Integrals To Truncated-differential
        Distinguishers.</strong> The core observation at the beginning
        of this work was that an integral distinguisher usually ends
        with a sum operation. In many Substitution-Permutation Networks
        (SPNs), the linear layer often consists of a sum of multiple
        words. At the end of an integral distinguisher, such a sum is
        equivalent to the sum of words that iterate over all values in
        the subspace -- hence, a sum of permutations. The sum still
        has a Balanced (i.e., zero-sum) property, which is usually
        destroyed by the subsequent non-linear layer. As illustrated
        in [Pat08, Pat13], the number of collisions induced by a sum
        of permutations differs slightly from that of an ideal
        function. The sum in the linear layer preserves this number of
        collisions through the subsequent S-box operation. Therefore,
        an integral distinguisher can be extended through the
        subsequent non-linear operation.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        We point out that Chen et al. [CMSZ15] had already considered
        this approach of Patarin's analysis for extending integrals of
        SPNs. They considered Type-II and Nyberg-type Feistel networks
        and conducted experiments on lightweight ciphers for which they
        could confirm that this strategy can lead to extended attacks.
        This work, however, focuses on the AES.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        <strong>Contribution.</strong> This work tries to extend the
        known integral to truncated-differential distinguishers. As a
        result, it describes a five-round distinguisher from a single
        byte to a mixed space. Since inputs start from single-byte
        differences, plaintext structures can form fewer pairs than in
        e.g., the structures from diagonals as in [GR18]. As a
        consequence, the data and computational complexity of the
        five-round distinguisher here are higher than those of the
        probabilistic distinguishers in [GR18], but our proposal
        allows a straightforward extension to a six-round key-recovery
        attack by prepending a round. We present the results of a
        practical implementation of the five-round distinguisher and
        the six-round key-recovery attacks with a small-scale variant
        of the AES. Finally, we propose a possible extension to a
        six-round truncated-differential distinguisher and report our
        results of its implementation for the small variant.

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        <strong>Brief Definition of The AES-128.</strong> The AES-128
        is a substitution-permutation network that transforms 128-bit
        inputs through ten rounds, consisting of SubBytes (SB),
        ShiftRows (SR), MixColumns (MC), and a round-key addition
        with a round key
        <span class="math">K^i</span>. We write
        <span class="math">S^i</span> for the state after Round
        <span class="math">i</span>, and
        <span class="math">S^i[j]</span> for the
        <span class="math">j</span>-th byte. We denote by

        one application of the round function, and by

        <span class="math">r</span> rounds without the key addition

        8 Discussion and Conclusion
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        This work extends the well-known integral distinguisher on
        three-round AES to truncated-differential distinguishers. Our
        attacks exploit a small difference in the average number of
        byte collisions between the sum of four permutations and the
        number of collisions for a truncated random permutation. In
        the AES, this sum is approximated by almost three rounds plus
        the MixColumns operation. The small but significant difference
        allowed us to extend the integral attack to four rounds. By
        extending this approach to collisions in the four bytes of an
        inverse diagonal, we proposed a novel five-round distinguisher
        for the AES.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        Compared to the five-round distinguisher by Grassi and
        Rechberger [GR19], our distinguishers start from a single
        active byte. Thus, they could benefit from the fact that one
        can easily prepend one round for an attack and start from a
        diagonal structure of
        <span class="math">2^&#123;32&#125;</span> texts. Although inferior to
        previous key-recovery results on the AES, we could extend it
        to a key-recovery attack on six rounds in Section 6. Moreover,
        Section 7 showed that even this prepended round could still be
        included in a secret-key distinguisher, with considerably
        lower but still distinguishable bias.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        <strong>Verifiability.</strong> We note that it is infeasible
        to verify the proposed distinguishers for the AES directly.
        Where possible, we tried to implement small-scale variants
        with Cid et al.'s established version of Small-AES with
        four-bit cells. We employed the transition-distribution
        approach by Ronjom as a second means of verification. All
        implementations are freely available online.

      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        Since our distinguisher starts from a single active byte, all

      </div>
      <p class="text-gray-300">
        The random binomial variance is approximately 510, so the

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        <strong>D.2 Variance of The Four-round Distinguisher.</strong>

        <span class="math">2^s</span>
        <span class="math">\delta</span>-sets for
        <span class="math">s \in \&#123;24, 26, 28, 30\&#125;</span>. We see
        considerable differences in the distribution starting from
        <span class="math">s = 28</span>, although still a broad
        overlap of both distributions. For
        <span class="math">s = 30</span>, the different distributions
        become apparent. The distinguisher is a consequence of ours
        but significantly more sophisticated to explore.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Abstract. Previously known techniques to construct pairing-friendly curves of prime or near-prime order are restricted to embedding degree k 6 6. More general methods produce curves over F<sup>p</sup> where the bit length of p is often twice as large as that of the order r of the subgroup with embedding degree k; the best published results achieve ρ ≡ log(p)/ log(r) ∼ 5/4. In this paper we make the first step towards surpassing these limitations by describing a method to construct elliptic curves of prime order and embedding degree k = 12. The new curves lead to very efficient implementation: non-pairing cryptosystem operations only need F<sup>p</sup> and Fp<sup>2</sup> arithmetic, and pairing values can be compressed to one sixth of their length in a way compatible with point reduction techniques. We also discuss the role of large CM discriminants D to minimize ρ; in particular, for embedding degree k = 2q where q is prime we show that the ability to handle log(D)/ log(r) ∼ (q − 3)/(q − 1) enables building curves with ρ ∼ q/(q − 1).</p>

    <h2 id="sec-2" class="text-2xl font-bold">1 Introduction</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A non-supersingular elliptic curve over F<sup>p</sup> is called pairing-friendly if it contains a subgroup of order r whose embedding degree k is not too large, which means that computations in the field Fp<sup>k</sup> are feasible. The optimal case occurs when the entire curve has prime order and the desired embedding degree.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Pairing-friendly curves of prime or near-prime order are absolutely essential in certain pairing-based schemes like short signatures with longer useful life. For instance, the length of BLS signatures [5] is the size of the base field p; at the 128-bit security level the scheme should be defined on a group of 256 bit order r and be mapped to a finite field of roughly 3072-bit size p k . In the optimal case, the embedding degree should be k = 12. Of course, other systems would benefit as well, since the space requirements for all quantities involved in cryptographic protocols except pairing values would be kept to a minimum (pairing compression techniques [16, 10] would help reducing the bandwidth for pairing values as well).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The pioneering work of Miyaji, Nakabayashi, and Takano [13] describes how to construct elliptic curves of prime order and embedding degree k ∈ {3, 4, 6}. Such curves are now dubbed MNT curves, and satisfy p ∼ r by the Hasse bound. Extensions of the original MNT construction to curves of near-prime order were investigated by Scott and Barreto [17], and more recently by Galbraith, McKee, and Valen¸ca [9]<sup>3</sup> . Unfortunately, those methods are restricted to k 6 6 and hence only allow for a tradeoff: one has to choose between increasing the base field to a 512-bit prime p (thus doubling the signature size, which ceases to be "short") or contenting oneself with the lower security level of a 1536-bit finite field Fp<sup>6</sup> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let ρ ≡ log(p)/ log(r) be the ratio between the bit lengths of the finite field and the order of the subgroup with embedding degree k. Several methods have been proposed to construct curves with arbitrary k, including a "folklore" algorithm [4, chapter 9] credited to Cocks and Pinch [7] and related methods due to Barreto, Lynn, and Scott [1] and to Dupont, Enge, and Morain [8]. In general these algorithms only achieve ρ ∼ 2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Algebraic methods may produce curves with ρ closer to unity for certain values of k. Such techniques include the families of curves described by Barreto, Lynn, and Scott [3], and by Brezing and Weng [7]. The latter presents the best known results, achieving ρ ∼ 5/4 for families of curves with k = 8 or k = 24, and ρ ∼ (k + 2)/(k − 1) for prime k (hence ρ 6 5/4 for prime k > 13). Such ratios are already useful under many circumstances. Still, for most embedding degrees the value of ρ is larger than this; for instance, the best published value for k = 12 is ρ ∼ 3/2. Besides, the use of prime k precludes many optimizations that are only possible for even k [2], making the computation of pairings much less efficient.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In spite of all these efforts, constructing pairing-friendly curves with prime order has remained an elusive open problem since it was posed by Boneh et al. [5, section 3.5] (see also [6, section 4.5]).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This paper is organised as follows.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our main contribution, described in section 2, is a surprisingly simple algorithm to construct curves of prime order and embedding degree k = 12. The resulting security enhancement is even better than the lower bound of k = 10 required by Boneh et al.. Using the proposed method, even a 160-bit signature maps to 1920-bit field, where the best algorithms to compute discrete logarithms are worse than Pollard-rho in the elliptic group itself.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We next discuss how to compress the representations of points and pairing values to one sixth of their expected length for the proposed curves in section 3. It turns out that non-pairing operations only need arithmetic over F<sup>p</sup> and Fp<sup>2</sup> ,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>3</sup> Interestingly, the latter work also considers the construction of hyperelliptic curves of genus g = 2 analogous to MNT elliptic curves, for which the range of embedding degrees is k ∈ {5, 8, 10, 12}, but the security ratio k/g is still bound by 6.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and it is possible to compute pairings compressed to one sixth of their length without resorting to full arithmetic on fields larger than  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, we show in section 4 that the ability to handle large complex multiplication (CM) discriminants may have a positive influence on the minimization of  <span class="math">\\rho</span> . In particular, for embedding degree k=2q where q is prime we describe how to build curves with  <span class="math">\\rho \\sim q/(q-1)</span>  and  <span class="math">\\log(D)/\\log(r) \\sim (q-3)/(q-1)</span> . Such discriminants are thus much smaller than expected from random curves with the same embedding degree. We also briefly discuss the possibility of building curves of nearly-prime order over extension fields.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We conclude and summarise our results in section 5.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 1.</strong> There exists an efficient algorithm to construct elliptic curves of prime order (of nearly arbitrary bitlength) and embedding degree k = 12 over a prime field.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof.</em> We follow the strategy of parametrising p(x), n(x) and t(x), and using the property that  <span class="math">n \\mid \\Phi_k(t-1)</span>  as in [1]. Since  <span class="math">\\Phi_{12}</span>  is quartic and we know from the Hasse bound that  <span class="math">n \\sim p \\sim t^2</span> , we must take t(x) to be a quadratic polynomial such that n(x) is a quartic factor of  <span class="math">\\Phi_{12}(t-1)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Galbraith <em>et al.</em> showed [9] that the only quadratic polynomials u(x) such that  <span class="math">\\Phi_{12}(u(x))</span>  splits into two irreducible quartic factors are  <span class="math">u(x) = 2x^2</span>  and  <span class="math">u(x) = 6x^2</span> . Setting the trace of the Frobenius to be  <span class="math">t(x) = 6x^2 + 1</span> , we obtain</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\Phi_{12}(t(x) - 1) = n(x)n(-x),</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">n(x)=36x^4+36x^3+18x^2+6x+1</span> . From the relation n=p+1-t we get the irreducible polynomial  <span class="math">p(x)=n(x)+t(x)-1=36x^4+36x^3+24x^2+6x+1</span> . The CM norm equation becomes</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">DV^2 = 4p - t^2 = 3(6x^2 + 4x + 1)^2.</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Assuming that, for some  <span class="math">x_0</span> , both  <span class="math">n = n(x_0)</span>  and  <span class="math">p = p(x_0)</span>  evaluate to prime numbers, the CM method for discriminant D = 3 [12, 14] produces curves of form  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_p): y^2 = x^3 + b</span> , with  <span class="math">b \\neq 0</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finding b is actually very simple: take the smallest  <span class="math">b \\neq 0</span>  such that b+1 is a quadratic residue mod p and the point  <span class="math">G = (1, \\sqrt{b+1} \\mod p)</span> , which is clearly on the curve<sup>4</sup>, satisfies  <span class="math">nG = \\infty</span> . This method is a simplification of the technique described in [11, section A.14.4] and quickly converges to a suitable b.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We see that the bitlength m of the curve order can be easily tailored by a suitable choice of  <span class="math">x_0</span> , namely, start with the smallest  <span class="math">x \\sim 2^{m/4}</span>  such that n(x) has bitlength m and increase it until finding some  <span class="math">x_0</span>  such that  <span class="math">n(x_0)</span>  and  <span class="math">p(x_0)</span>  are prime.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&</sup>lt;sup>4</sup> Since the curve order n(x) is a large prime, there is no point of form (0, y), which would necessarily have order 3.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In summary, we have the following parametrisation, where x may take either positive or negative values:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">t = 6x^{2} + 1,</span></div>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">n = 36x^{4} + 36x^{3} + 18x^{2} + 6x + 1,</span></div>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">p = 36x^{4} + 36x^{3} + 24x^{2} + 6x + 1,</span></div>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">DV^{2} = 108x^{4} + 144x^{3} + 84x^{2} + 24x + 3 = 3(6x^{2} + 4x + 1)^{2}.</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The choice  <span class="math">u(x) = 2x^2</span>  as indicated in [9] is not considered, since in this case  <span class="math">DV^2</span>  factors as a square free product of irreducible polynomials which in general leads to an enormous CM discriminant D and therefore is not practical. This would also be the case if one took u(x) to be a linear polynomial.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Algorithm 1 shows how the CM method simplifies in our setting. The algorithm takes as input value the desired bitlength of the primes p and n, and returns instances of these primes computed as indicated in the proof of theorem 1, plus a parameter  <span class="math">b \\in \\mathbb{F}_p</span>  such that the curve  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_p) : y^2 = x^3 + b</span>  has order n over the field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> , and the coordinate y of a sample generator G = (1, y). Appendix A gives a few examples of cryptographic interest. Algorithm 1 tends to produce the smallest p and n of the desired bitlength, but it is straightforward to modify it so that the output parameters meet other simple criteria (for instance, the examples in appendix A were selected to maximize p and n while keeping b = 3).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The parametrisation given above may also be deduced in terms of [7]. Choosing a polynomial u(x) such that  <span class="math">\\Phi_k(u(x))</span>  splits may then be interpreted as choosing a suitable number field in the following way. Let l(x) be an irreducible factor of  <span class="math">\\Phi_k(u(x))</span>  and consider the number field</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">K = \\mathbb{Q}[x]/(l(x)).</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As u(x) is a root of  <span class="math">\\Phi_k</span>  over K it is a primitive k-th root of unity modulo l. If D is chosen such that -D is a square in K we set  <span class="math">t(x) = u(x)^i + 1 \\mod l(x)</span>  and  <span class="math">V(x) := (u(x)^i - 1)\\sqrt{-D}^{-1} \\mod l(x)</span>  where  <span class="math">i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, k-1\\}</span> . If  <span class="math">p(x) = (t(x)^2 - DV(x)^2)/4</span>  is irreducible, one sets n = p+1-t. We are able to check for the ratio  <span class="math">\\deg(p)/\\deg(l)</span>  to be less than a certain given bound. Choosing  <span class="math">u(x) = 6x^2</span>  and D = 3 yields the above parametrisation as well.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Contrary to the case k=12, finding parametrisations when  <span class="math">\\varphi(k)&gt;4</span>  (but keeping k reasonably small) seems a rather difficult problem. The method suggested in [9] to find quadratic polynomials u(x) such that  <span class="math">\\Phi_k(u(x))</span>  splits, implies finding integer or rational points on an elliptic curve. Increasing  <span class="math">\\varphi(k)</span>  leads to a higher number of indeterminates and also increases the number of equations to deal with. To combine them into a single equation of an elliptic curve may in this case be impossible. The computation of a resultant as suggested in [9] only reduces the number of indeterminates by one and thus in general will not help. One may try to find polynomials u(x) of degree greater than two such that  <span class="math">\\Phi_k(u(x))</span>  splits, but this results in higher degree equations to be solved. We leave it as an open problem the task of building curves of prime order and  <span class="math">\\varphi(k) &gt; 4</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Furthermore, for efficiency reasons in the pairing computation it is desirable to generate curves of prime order n such that n has a low Hamming weight. Constructing such curves for k = 12 or  <span class="math">\\varphi(k) &gt; 4</span>  is still a research problem.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A fascinating possibility suggested by the proposed curves is to enable cryptosystems more efficient than what was attainable with most previously known curves. We now consider two such improvements, namely, point compression and pairing compression, both to about one sixth of the requirements one would expect in naive implementations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The basic idea for point compression is not only to restrict the first pairing argument to  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_p)</span> , but also to take the second argument  <span class="math">Q \\in E(\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}})</span>  as the image  <span class="math">\\psi(Q&#x27;)</span>  of a point on a sextic twist  <span class="math">E&#x27;(\\mathbb{F}_{p^2})</span> , where  <span class="math">\\psi: E&#x27;(\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}) \\to E(\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}})</span>  is an injective group homomorphism. This way one would work only with  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_p)</span>  and  <span class="math">E&#x27;(\\mathbb{F}_{p^2})</span>  for non-pairing operations like key generation, and map from  <span class="math">E&#x27;(\\mathbb{F}_{p^2})</span>  to  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}})</span>  only when actually computing pairing values. As it turns out, it is possible to do better than this, namely, one can work with smaller fields, as we show next.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lemma 1.</strong> There exists  <span class="math">\\xi \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^2}^*</span>  such that  <span class="math">X^6 - \\xi</span>  is irreducible over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}[X]</span>  whenever  <span class="math">p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof. Since  <span class="math">p^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6</span> , the order of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2} = p^2 - 1</span>  is a multiple of 6. Thus for any primitive root  <span class="math">a \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^2}</span> , the cube roots of unity are  <span class="math">\\{1, \\zeta, \\zeta^2\\}</span>  where  <span class="math">\\zeta \\equiv a^{(p^2-1)/3}</span> . Hence every cube  <span class="math">u^3 \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^2}^<em></span>  has three distinct cube roots, namely,  <span class="math">\\{u, \\zeta u, \\zeta^2 u\\}</span> , which means that only one third of the elements of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}^</em></span>  are cubes. Analogously, only one half of the elements of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}^<em></span>  are squares. Therefore, there must be some element  <span class="math">\\xi \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^2}^</em></span>  that is neither a square nor a cube, and hence  <span class="math">X^6 - \\xi</span>  is irreducible over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}[X]</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Any  <span class="math">\\xi \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^2}^*</span>  provided by lemma 1 may be used to represent  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}</span>  as  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}[X]/(X^6-\\xi)</span>  and to define a sextic twist  <span class="math">E&#x27;(\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}): y&#x27;^2=x&#x27;^3+b/\\xi</span> . A sensible strategy to obtain  <span class="math">\\xi</span>  without resorting to full  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}</span>  arithmetic is to set  <span class="math">1/\\xi=\\lambda^2\\mu^3</span>  where  <span class="math">\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{F}_p</span>  is a noncube and  <span class="math">\\mu \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^2}</span>  is a nonsquare.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">z \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}</span>  be a root of  <span class="math">X^6 - \\xi</span> . The corresponding map  <span class="math">\\psi : E&#x27;(\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}) \\to E(\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}})</span>  is  <span class="math">(x&#x27;, y&#x27;) \\mapsto (z^2 x&#x27;, z^3 y&#x27;)</span> . Notice that  <span class="math">x = z^2 x&#x27; \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^6}</span>  and  <span class="math">y = z^3 y&#x27; \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span> . Also, since any element of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}</span>  has the form  <span class="math">a_5 z^5 + a_4 z^4 + a_3 z^3 + a_2 z^2 + a_1 z + a_0</span>  the computation of  <span class="math">\\psi(Q&#x27;)</span>  does not incur any multiplication overhead, and its rather sparse structure favours efficient implementation of the pairing algorithm.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Alternatively, one may use  <span class="math">\\xi^5</span>  instead of  <span class="math">\\xi</span>  if the first choice produces a twist E' of wrong order ( <span class="math">\\xi^2</span> ,  <span class="math">\\xi^3</span> , and  <span class="math">\\xi^4</span>  give quadratic and cubic twists).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">These considerations open the way to compressing pairing values to one sixth of their length in a way that is compatible with point reduction (that is, the technique of keeping only one point coordinate and entirely discarding the other one). Notice that the map  <span class="math">(x&#x27;, y&#x27;) \\mapsto (z^2 x&#x27;, z^3 y&#x27;)</span>  produces a point on  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}})</span>  whose x-coordinate is in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^6}</span>  and whose y-coordinate is in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Now suppose that we keep only the y-coordinate of the point Q'=(x',y') on the twist  <span class="math">E&#x27;(\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}): y&#x27;^2=x&#x27;^3+b/\\xi</span>  (this is contrary to the conventional choice of keeping only the x-coordinate). There are three points associated to this y-coordinate corresponding to the three cube roots of  <span class="math">y&#x27;^2-b/\\xi</span> . One of the points is Q'. Upon mapping onto  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}})</span> , it turns out that those points map to conjugates over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span>  (i.e. their images are of form Q,  <span class="math">[p^4]Q</span>  and  <span class="math">[p^8]Q</span> ) provided Q' is an n-torsion point. This can be seen from the following arguments. Notice that the order of the twist is  <span class="math">\\#E&#x27;(\\mathbb{F}_{p^2})=(p+1-t)(p-1+t)=n(2p-n)</span>  and hence there exist n-torsion points. Let  <span class="math">\\phi</span>  be the p-th power Frobenius endomorphism and  <span class="math">\\operatorname{tr}_{\\mathbb{F}_{p^6}}: E(\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}) \\to E(\\mathbb{F}_{p^6}), \\ R \\mapsto R + \\phi^6(R)</span>  the trace map over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^6}</span> . An explicit computation leads to the following lemma.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lemma 2.</strong> Let <span class="math-block">Q&#x27; = (x&#x27;, y&#x27;) \\in E&#x27;(\\mathbb{F}_{p^2})</span>  and  <span class="math">Q = \\psi(Q&#x27;)</span> . Then  <span class="math">\\operatorname{tr}_{\\mathbb{F}_{p^6}}(Q) = Q + \\phi^6(Q) = O</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The Frobenius endomorphism has two eigenspaces in  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}})[n]</span>  for the eigenvalues 1,p. The 1-eigenspace consists of all points in  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_p)</span>  while the p-Eigenspace is the set of points of trace zero. Therefore we obtain the following lemma which shows that for an n-torsion point whose  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^6}</span> -trace is O computing the p-multiple is the same as computing the Frobenius endomorphism.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lemma 3.</strong> Let <span class="math-block">Q \\in E(\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}})[n]</span> . Then  <span class="math">\\operatorname{tr}_{\\mathbb{F}_{n^6}}(Q) = O</span>  iff  <span class="math">\\phi(Q) = [p]Q</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">Q=\\psi(Q&#x27;)</span>  for an n-torsion point Q' on the sextic twist. From lemma 2 we see that we may apply lemma 3 and compute  <span class="math">[p^4]Q=\\phi^4(Q)=((z^2)^{p^4}x&#x27;,z^3y&#x27;)</span>  as well as  <span class="math">[p^8]Q=\\phi^8(Q)=((z^2)^{p^2}x&#x27;,z^3y&#x27;)</span> . The points  <span class="math">Q,[p^4]Q</span>  and  <span class="math">[p^8]Q</span>  share the same y-coordinate and therefore have to be the images under  <span class="math">\\psi</span>  of the above mentioned three points corresponding to the given y-coordinate on the twist.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The above shows that the pairing values computed from the three points are also conjugates over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span>  (i.e. they are of the form  <span class="math">e, e^{p^4}</span>  and  <span class="math">e^{p^8}</span> ). Thus, the  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span> -trace of these pairing values is the same for any of the three points. In other words, the choice of the cube root is irrelevant to compute the compressed pairing  <span class="math">\\varepsilon(P,Q&#x27;) \\equiv \\operatorname{tr}_{\\mathbb{F}_{p^4}}(e(P,\\psi(Q&#x27;))) = e(P,\\psi(Q&#x27;)) + e(P,\\psi(Q&#x27;))^{p^4} + e(P,\\psi(Q&#x27;))^{p^8}</span> , whose length is one third of the length of  <span class="math">e(P,\\psi(Q&#x27;))</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One even may go one step further and not only discard the x-coordinate of Q' but also discard one bit of its y-coordinate. This means we do not distinguish between Q' and -Q'. With help of the following lemma we can show that pairing compression up to one sixth of the actual pairing length is possible.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lemma 4.</strong> Let  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  be an n-th root of unity in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\operatorname{tr}_{\\mathbb{F}_{p^{2}}}:\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}\\to\\mathbb{F}_{p^{2}}</span>  the finite field trace over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{2}}</span> . Then  <span class="math">\\operatorname{tr}_{\\mathbb{F}_{n^{2}}}(\\zeta^{-1})=\\operatorname{tr}_{\\mathbb{F}_{n^{2}}}(\\zeta)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof. Since n divides  <span class="math">\\Phi_{12}(t-1)</span>  it divides  <span class="math">\\Phi_{12}(p)=p^4-p^2+1</span> . So n also divides  <span class="math">p^6+1=(p^2+1)(p^4-p^2+1)</span> . Therefore since  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  is an n-th root of unity we have  <span class="math">\\zeta^{-1}=\\zeta^{p^6}</span> . We now see that  <span class="math">\\mathrm{tr}_{\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}}(\\zeta^{-1})=\\zeta^{-1}+\\zeta^{-p^2}+\\zeta^{-p^4}+\\zeta^{-p^6}+\\zeta^{-p^8}+\\zeta^{-p^{10}}=\\zeta^{p^6}+\\zeta^{p^8}+\\zeta^{p^{10}}+\\zeta+\\zeta^{p^2}+\\zeta^{p^4}=\\mathrm{tr}_{\\mathbb{F}_{n^2}}(\\zeta)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that all pairing values are n-th roots of unity in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}</span>  and hence  <span class="math">\\operatorname{tr}_{\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}}(e(P,\\psi(Q&#x27;))) = \\operatorname{tr}_{\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}}(e(P,\\psi(Q&#x27;))^{-1}) = \\operatorname{tr}_{\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}}(e(P,\\psi(-Q&#x27;)))</span> . Together with the transitivity of traces using the above condition on  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span> - traces, this yields that the  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}</span> -traces of the pairing values are equal for all points  <span class="math">(x&#x27;,\\pm y&#x27;), (\\zeta_3 x&#x27;,\\pm y&#x27;)</span>  and  <span class="math">(\\zeta_3^2 x&#x27;,\\pm y&#x27;)</span>  where  <span class="math">\\zeta_3^3=1</span>  in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The advantage of this approach is that one can not only work exclusively on  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}</span>  for non-pairing operations, but also represent points on  <span class="math">E&#x27;(\\mathbb{F}_{p^2})</span>  by the positive or negative of their y-coordinates alone in most protocols, yet obtain a unique compressed pairing value over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}</span> . We point out that the compression ratio of 1/6 is better than what is attainable on any practical supersingular Abelian variety, namely, 8/30, as shown by Rubin and Silverberg [15].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Laddering techniques as those described in [16] to compute pairings may even make it unnecessary to implement full arithmetic over any field higher than  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}</span> . Similar effects may be achieved in a torus-based setting as suggested in [10]. If the x-coordinate corresponding to a point in  <span class="math">E&#x27;(\\mathbb{F}_{p^2})</span>  with given y-coordinate y' is needed, one may obtain it by simply computing a cube root of  <span class="math">y&#x27;^2 - b/\\xi</span> . In appendix B we discuss the computation of cube roots in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}^*</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Under some circumstances, a reasonably small cofactor may be quite acceptable. For instance, if 256-bit prime fields do not have a substantial impact on bandwidth occupation, the Brezing-Weng family of curves for k=8 and  <span class="math">\\rho\\sim 5/4</span>  could provide roughly 200-bit group orders and map the discrete logarithm on the curve to a 2048-bit finite field. Besides, as we already pointed out even values of k are advantageous from the point of view of efficient implementation of the pairing algorithm. It is thus interesting to investigate ways to produce more curves that meet the conditions that k be even and  <span class="math">\\rho&gt;1</span>  be as small as possible (say,  <span class="math">\\rho\\leqslant 5/4</span> ).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A naive approach to solving the norm equation  <span class="math">DV^2 = 4h\\Phi_k(t-1) - (t-2)^2</span> , namely, by choosing t and hoping to be able to handle the resulting D, is in general bound to failure since  <span class="math">D \\sim t^{\\varphi(k)}</span> , where  <span class="math">\\varphi(k)</span>  is Euler's totient function. For instance, for k = 2q where q is an odd prime we expect to find  <span class="math">D \\sim t^{q-1}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, it would be quite simple to obtain curves with k=2q if we could handle a CM discriminant D as large as  <span class="math">t^{q-3}</span> , attaining  <span class="math">\\rho \\equiv \\log(p)/\\log(r) \\sim q/(q-1)</span>  as the following reasoning reveals. Let the trace of Frobenius have the form  <span class="math">t=-4u^2+2</span>  for some u (notice that t is negative), and let x=t-1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Assume that Φk(x) takes a prime value. Then set:</p>

Since p = hr + t − 1, it is also clear that ρ ∼ q/(q − 1). For instance, if k = 10 (i.e. ρ ∼ 5/4) we get z = x <sup>2</sup> − x + 1, and a simple search produces parameters like these:</p>

    <h3 id="sec-7" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.1 Curves over extension fields</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Another interesting observation is that, while none of the currently known methods to construct pairing-friendly curves for arbitrary k is able to produce curves over an extension field Fp<sup>m</sup>, it may be possible to fill this gap if sufficiently large D can be handled. As Galbraith et al. point out [9], parametrising t = 5x <sup>2</sup> + 1 causes Φ5(t − 1) to split as Φ5(t − 1) = r(x)r(−x), where  <span class="math">r(x)=25x^4+25x^3+15x^2+5x+1</span> . We observe that with cofactor h=4, this gives  <span class="math">hr+t-1=(10x^2+5x+2)^2</span> , a perfect square. This means that finding an odd value  <span class="math">x\\in\\mathbb{Z}</span>  such that r and  <span class="math">p=10x^2+5x+2</span>  are both prime enables constructing an elliptic curve over a finite field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}</span>  with near-prime order n=4r.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The CM equation here has the form  <span class="math">DV^2 = 5(5x^2 \\pm 2x + 1)(15x^2 \\pm 10x + 3)</span> . Solving a Pell-like equation can make one but not both of the factors  <span class="math">5x^2 \\pm 2x + 1</span>  or  <span class="math">15x^2 \\pm 10x + 3</span>  to assume the form  <span class="math">dy^2</span>  for small d and some y. One might hope that techniques like Hensel lifting could reduce the square-free part of the other factor to O(x), but it is not clear how to harmonise such techniques to solutions of the Pell-like equation. As a consequence, we expect that  <span class="math">D \\sim p \\sim r^{1/2}</span> ; practical values of p would need  <span class="math">D \\sim 2^{100}</span>  at least.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Nevertheless, such a parametrisation hints that algebraic methods to build ordinary pairing-friendly curves over extension fields might exist for other embedding degrees, and deserved further research.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-8" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5 Conclusion</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We have presented a very simple algorithm to construct pairing-friendly curves of prime order and embedding degree k=12. This closes (and actually exceeds) the open problem proposed by Boneh <em>et al.</em> [5, section 3.5] and enhances the security level of most pairing-based cryptosystems, while also reducing bandwidth occupation (by either points or pairing values) down to 1/6 of the expected requirements; such levels of security and compression are better than what is attainable with any supersingular Abelian variety up to at least genus 6. We leave it as an open problem the task of extending the method for higher values of k.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We have also discussed ways to produce curves of composite order and reasonably small cofactor as long as large discriminants fall within reach of CM methods, and pointed out the possibility of closing yet another problem, namely, building pairing-friendly curves of nearly-prime order over extension fields. Further exploration of such possibilities is left for future research.</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">r \\equiv a^{(2p+1)/9} \\pmod{p}.</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since (2p+1)/9 is the inverse to 3 modulo (p-1)/3, this clearly gives a cube root of a.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The examples given in appendix A all have  <span class="math">p \\equiv 4 \\pmod{9}</span> . For recovering the x-coordinate of points on  <span class="math">E&#x27;(\\mathbb{F}_{p^2})</span>  given only their y-coordinate as it was indicated in section 3 one needs to compute a cube root in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}^<em></span> . We consider the case  <span class="math">p \\equiv 4 \\pmod{9}</span> . Then  <span class="math">p^2 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{9}</span> . For a cube  <span class="math">a \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^2}^</em></span>  it holds  <span class="math">a^{(p^2-1)/3} = 1</span>  for the same reasons as in the  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  case. Again the computation of a cube root only takes one exponentiation  <span class="math">r = a^{(p^2+2)/9}</span> .</p>`;

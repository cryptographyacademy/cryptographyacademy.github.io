    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Abstract.</strong> The Learning with Errors (LWE) problem, proposed by Regev in 2005, has become an ever-popular cryptographic primitive, due mainly to its simplicity, flexibility and convincing theoretical arguments regarding its hardness. Among the main proposed approaches to solving LWE instances — namely, lattice algorithms, combinatorial algorithms, and algebraic algorithms — the last is the one that has received the least attention in the literature, and is the focus of this paper. We present a detailed and refined complexity analysis of the original Arora-Ge algorithm, which reduced LWE to solving a system of high-degree, error-free polynomials. Moreover, we generalise their method and establish the complexity of applying Gröbner basis techniques from computational commutative algebra to solving LWE. As a result, we show that the use of Gröbner basis algorithms yields an exponential speed-up over the basic Arora-Ge algorithm. On the other hand, our results show that such techniques do not yield a subexponential algorithm for the LWE problem.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We also apply our algebraic algorithm to the BinaryError-LWE problem, which was recently introduced by Micciancio and Peikert. We show that BinaryError-LWE in dimension n can be solved in subexponential time given access to a quasi-linear number of samples m under a regularity assumption. We also give precise complexity bounds for BinaryError-LWE given access to linearly many samples. Our approach outperforms the best currently-known generic heuristic exact CVP solver as soon as  <span class="math">m/n \\geq 6.6</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The results in this work depend crucially on the assumption that the encountered systems have no special structure. We give experimental evidence that this assumption holds and also prove the assumption in some special cases. Therewith, we also make progress towards proving Fröberg's long-standing conjecture from algebraic geometry.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-1" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">1 Introduction</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Learning with Errors. Since its introduction, the Learning with Errors problem (LWE) has proven to be a rich and versatile source of many innovative cryptographic constructions, such as the oblivious transfer protocol by Peikert et al. [37], a leakage-resilient cryptosystem by Akavia et al. [1], and homomorphic encryption [3, 15, 30], among many others.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 1</strong> (LWE [38,39]). Let  <span class="math">n, m \\geq 1</span>  be integers, q be an odd positive integer,  <span class="math">\\chi</span>  be a probability distribution on  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}_q</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbf{s} \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q^n</span>  be a secret vector. We denote by  <span class="math">L_{\\mathbf{s},\\chi}^{(n)}</span>  the probability distribution on  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}_q^{n \\times m} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q^m</span>  obtained by choosing  <span class="math">A \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q^{n \\times m}</span>  uniformly at random, sampling a vector  <span class="math">\\mathbf{e} \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q^m</span>  according to  <span class="math">\\chi^m</span> , and returning  <span class="math">(A, \\mathbf{s} \\cdot A + \\mathbf{e}) = (A, \\mathbf{c}) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q^{n \\times m} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q^m</span> . LWE is the problem of finding  <span class="math">\\mathbf{s} \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q^n</span>  from  <span class="math">(A, \\mathbf{s} \\cdot A + \\mathbf{e})</span>  sampled according to  <span class="math">L_{\\mathbf{s},\\chi}^{(n)}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In what follows,  <span class="math">\\chi_{\\alpha,q}</span>  will denote a discrete Gaussian distribution over  <span class="math">\\mathbb Z</span>  which returns an integer x with probability  <span class="math">\\exp\\left(-\\pi\\,x^2/s^2\\right)/\\sum_{y\\in\\mathbb Z}\\exp\\left(-\\pi\\,y^2/s^2\\right)</span> , where  <span class="math">s=\\alpha q</span> , considered modulo q. A typical setting is  <span class="math">\\alpha q=n^\\epsilon</span> , with  <span class="math">0\\leq\\epsilon\\leq 1</span> . It has been shown that as soon as  <span class="math">\\epsilon&gt;1/2</span> , worst-case GAPSVP <span class="math">_{\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n/\\alpha)}</span>  reduces to average-case LWE [14, 36, 38, 39]. Thus, any algorithm solving LWE for  <span class="math">\\epsilon&gt;1/2</span>  can solve GAPSVP <span class="math">_{\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n/\\alpha)}</span> . It is widely believed that only exponential classical and quantum algorithms exist for solving GAPSVP <span class="math">_{\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n/\\alpha)}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Arora and Ge's algorithm. In [5], Arora and Ge proposed the first algebraic algorithm to solve the LWE problem. Their approach reduces LWE to finding the common root of a multivariate system of high-degree, error-free polynomials. The proposed algorithm solves LWE in  <span class="math">2^{\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{2\\epsilon})}</span>  operations, hence being sub-exponential when  <span class="math">\\epsilon &lt; \\frac{1}{2}</span> . This shows that Regev's original reduction in [38,39] is indeed tight.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In more detail, let  <span class="math">(\\mathbf{a},c) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q^n \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q</span>  be an LWE sample and write  <span class="math">f = c - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbf{a}_i \\cdot x_i</span>  where the  <span class="math">x_i</span>  are variables. If we assume that the error e is in the interval  <span class="math">\\{-T,\\ldots,T\\}</span> , then the polynomial F=f and  <span class="math">f \\in \\prod_{i=1}^T (f+i) \\cdot (f-i)</span>  of degree  <span class="math">f \\in T</span>  are variables. If we assume that the error  <span class="math">f \\in T</span>  is in the interval  <span class="math">f \\in T</span> , then the polynomial  <span class="math">f \\in T</span>  is a constraint on the possible values for the secret vector  <span class="math">f \\in T</span> , and collecting many such equations and solving the resulting multivariate high-degree system of equations allows to recover the secret. In [5] these systems are solved by the linearisation method, i.e. first replacing monomials with a new linearised variable and then by solving the resulting linear system of equations. This method requires  <span class="math">f \\in T</span>  equations to succeed, which could be obtained by collecting more samples. However, since  <span class="math">f \\in T</span>  is a discrete Gaussian distribution, requesting more samples also increases the probability that the noise of at least one sample falls outside of the chosen interval  <span class="math">f \\in T</span>  invalidating the constraint  <span class="math">f \\in T</span> . Hence, as the number of samples grows so does the required value of  <span class="math">f \\in T</span>  so that the polynomial system remains error-free. This on the other hand may require a further increase in the number of samples (cf. Section 3). This trade-off is analysed in [5] to obtain the complexity of the Arora-Ge algebraic algorithm to solve LWE. We note however that the discussion above implies that the algorithm from [5] is not applicable if the number of available samples is smaller than  <span class="math">f \\in T</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Section 4, we make a detailed analysis of the original Arora-Ge algorithm, and derive the precise complexity of applying linearisation as described above. The results of our analysis are given in the following theorem.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Result 1</strong> Let  <span class="math">n,q,\\sigma=\\alpha q/\\sqrt{2\\pi}</span>  be parameters of an LWE <span class="math">_{\\chi_{\\alpha,q}}</span>  instance,  <span class="math">2\\leq\\omega&lt;3</span>  be the linear algebra constant and  <span class="math">D_{\\rm AG}=8\\,\\sigma^2\\log n+1</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If  <span class="math">D_{AG} \\in o(n)</span>  then the Arora-Ge algorithm solves the computational LWE problem in</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\,\\omega \\cdot D_{\\mathrm{AG}} \\log \\frac{n}{D_{\\mathrm{AG}}}} \\cdot \\sigma \\, q \\log q\\right) = \\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\,8\\,\\omega \\, \\sigma^2 \\log n (\\log n - \\log(8\\,\\sigma^2 \\log n))} \\cdot \\mathrm{poly}(n)\\right)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">operations and in</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\,\\omega \\cdot n \\log \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{AG}}}{n}} \\cdot \\sigma \\, q \\log q\\right) = \\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{\\,\\omega \\, n \\log(8 \\, \\sigma^2 \\log n) - \\omega \\, n \\log n} \\cdot \\mathrm{poly}(n)\\right)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">operations if  <span class="math">n \\in o(\\sigma^2 \\log(n))</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Specialising to  <span class="math">\\sigma = \\sqrt{n}</span>  we obtain a complexity of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{(2+\\epsilon)\\omega n \\log \\log n}\\right)</span> . Our results shows that, in this case, the original Arora-Ge algorithm is asymptotically slower than the BKW algorithm [2] and lattice reduction if sieving is used to implement the SVP oracle, but asymptotically faster than lattice reduction if enumeration is used to implement the SVP oracle [4].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Gröbner bases. Gröbner bases are fundamental tools in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. A Gröbner basis G for an ideal  <span class="math">\\mathcal{I}</span>  in a polynomial ring is a basis such that any leading term of any element in the ideal  <span class="math">\\mathcal{I}</span>  is divisible by a leading term of an element in G. In univariate polynomial rings the notion of a Gröbner basis coincides with the greatest common divisor; for linear polynomials it coincides with the notion of a row echelon form. Gröbner bases go back to the seminal work of Buchberger [16, 17, 19] who also gave a first algorithm for computing them by showing that repeated computation and reduction of S-polynomials computes a Gröbner basis. Gröbner basis algorithms have been frequently applied (successfully) on the algebraic cryptanalysis of a range of cryptographic schemes [27].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this work we are interested in the fact that Gröbner bases allow to find all common roots of multivariate polynomial systems. Indeed, the linearisation approach described above is a special case of a Gröbner basis computation. In contrast to this special case, though, general Gröbner basis algorithms are also applicable if less than  <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^d\\right)</span>  polynomials of degree d are available – at the cost of increased computational complexity. We give more background on Gröbner bases in Section 2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Section 5 we show that applying standard Gröbner basis algorithms yields an exponential speed-up for solving LWE compared to Result 1, under a regularity assumption. In particular, we arrive at the following theorem.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Result 2</strong> Let  <span class="math">\\omega</span>  be the linear algebra constant, let  <span class="math">H_2(x) = -x \\log_2(x) - (1-x) \\log_2(1-x)</span>  be the binary entropy function and C some known constant which can be explicitly computed. Let  <span class="math">(\\mathbf{a}_i, b_i)_{i \\geq 1}</span>  be elements of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}_q^n \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q</span>  sampled according to  <span class="math">\\mathrm{LWE}_{\\chi_{\\alpha,q}}</span>  with a standard deviation  <span class="math">\\sigma = \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}</span> . There is an algorithm solving the computational LWE problem in</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathcal{O}\\left(2^{n\\left(\\omega\\left(1+C\\right)H_{2}\\left(\\frac{C}{1+C}\\right)+\\frac{\\pi\\cdot\\log_{2}(e)}{4}\\right)}\\right) \\tag{1}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">operations with success probability of at least  <span class="math">1 - \\frac{2}{\\pi\\sqrt{n}} = 1 - o(1)</span> , if the system of equations encountered during the execution of the algorithm is semi-regular.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Hence, applying Gröbner basis algorithms gives an exponential speed-up over the algorithm from [5]. This places it in the same complexity class as the BKW algorithm or lattice reduction when sieving implements the SVP oracle, albeit with a larger leading constant in the exponent. It is worth noting that all known algorithms for achieving time complexity  <span class="math">2^{\\mathcal{O}(n)}</span>  – BKW, sieving, Gröbner bases – also require  <span class="math">2^{\\mathcal{O}(n)}</span>  memory.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">BinaryError-LWE. A variant of LWE with errors values in  <span class="math">\\{0,1\\}</span>  (or any uniform range) was recently introduced by Micianccio and Peikert in [35]. This generalises an earlier result of Döttling and Müller-Quade [22] who first introduced a variant of LWE with uniform errors whilst keeping a strong security reduction to lattice problems. These two works highlight the current interest of the cryptographic community in studying variants of LWE with small non-Gaussian errors. From a practical perspective these variants are interesting because they allow to forgoe Gaussian sampling (with large parameters) which is often the most expensive step when implementing lattice-based cryptography. In this regard [35] represents a significant step forward as it allows to sample the error from a binary distribution while still regaining a reduction to GAPSVP, albeit with a severe limit on the number of samples m:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 1</strong> (BinaryError-LWE [35]). Let  <span class="math">n, m = n \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{c \\log(n)}\\right)</span>  for c &gt; 1 be integers, and  <span class="math">q \\ge n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}</span>  be a sufficiently large polynomially bounded (prime) modulus. Then, solving LWE with parameters n, m, q and independent uniformly random binary errors is at least as hard as approximating lattice problems in the worst-case on  <span class="math">\\Theta(n/\\log(n))</span> -dimensional lattices within a factor  <span class="math">\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{n} \\cdot q)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As already pointed out in [22,35], the algorithm from [5] yields a polynomial-time algorithm for solving BinaryError-LWE as soon as  <span class="math">m = \\mathcal{O}\\left(n^2\\right)</span> . Hence, there is a gap between  <span class="math">m = n\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{c\\log(n)}\\right)</span>  for c &gt; 1, where the hardness reduces to standard LWE, and  <span class="math">m = \\mathcal{O}\\left(n^2\\right)</span>  where the problem is known to be easy due to the Arora-Ge algorithm. However, understanding the hardness of the problem for samples within this interval should be of great interest: applications in lattice-based cryptography typically require the provision of  <span class="math">n\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{c\\log(n)}\\right) &lt; m &lt; \\mathcal{O}\\left(n^2\\right)</span>  samples, e.g.  <span class="math">m = \\mathcal{O}\\left(n\\right)</span>  or  <span class="math">m = \\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n)</span> . It is hence a natural and relevant open question how the security of BinaryError-LWE degrades as more samples are made available.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">From [5] and our generalisation using Gröbner basis algorithms, it follows that the complexity of solving LWE with uniform errors in  <span class="math">\\{-T,\\ldots,T\\}</span>  is at most the cost of computing a Gröbner basis for m polynomials of degree 2T+1 in n variables. In Section 6, we show – under a similar regularity assumption as above – that BinaryError-LWE can be solved in sub-exponential time as soon as the number of samples is quasi-linear, e.g.  <span class="math">m=\\mathcal{O}\\left(n\\log\\log n\\right)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Result 3</strong> Let  <span class="math">\\omega</span>  be the linear algebra constant and let  <span class="math">H_2(x) = -x \\log_2(x) - (1-x) \\log_2(1-x)</span>  be the binary entropy function. If  <span class="math">m = \\mathcal{O}(n \\log \\log n)</span> , then there exists an algorithm which solves the BinaryError-LWE problem in</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathcal{O}\\left(m^2 \\, 2^{\\frac{\\omega \\, n \\, \\log \\log \\log n}{8 \\log \\log n}}\\right)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">operations if the equation system encountered in the execution of the algorithm is semi-regular. If  <span class="math">m = C \\cdot n</span> , with  <span class="math">C \\ge 1</span> , then there exists an algorithm which solves the BinaryError-LWE problem in</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^2 \\, 2^{\\omega \\, n(1+\\beta) \\, H_2\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{1+\\beta}\\right)}\\right)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">operations with with  <span class="math">\\beta = \\left(C - \\frac{1}{2} - \\sqrt{C(C-1)}\\right)</span>  if the system of equations encountered during the execution of the algorithm is semi-regular.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">More concretely, the algorithm discussed in this paper can solve the BinaryError-LWE problem in dimension n in time  <span class="math">n^2 \\cdot 2^{0.344\\,n}</span>  as soon as  <span class="math">m \\geq 6.6\\,n</span> . For comparison, the best currently-known generic exact CVP solver [11] takes time  <span class="math">2^{0.377\\,n}</span> . We note that many other LWE solving strategies such as combinatorial algorithms [2] or lattice reduction in the low advantage regime [34] do not apply in this setting.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our results (Theorem 7, Section 6) show therefore that, despite its attractive implementation features, BinaryError-LWE should be ruled out for cryptographic applications that require a quasi-linear number of samples. Finally we note that while our results can also apply to the natural generalisations of BinaryError-LWE to any uniform error in a bounded interval  <span class="math">\\{-T,\\ldots,T\\}</span>  [35, Theorem 4.6], in this paper we focus on the BinaryError-LWE case for brevity.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Regularity Assumptions.</em> Our complexity estimates depend crucially on two algebraic assumptions about the systems we consider. The assumption is as follows for BinaryError-LWE:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Assumption 2.</strong> Let  <span class="math">(A, \\mathbf{s} \\cdot A + \\mathbf{e}) = (A, \\mathbf{c}) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q^{n \\times m} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q^m</span>  be sampled according to  <span class="math">L_{\\mathbf{s}, \\mathcal{U}(\\mathbb{F}_2)}^{(n)}</span> , and let P(x) = X(X - 1). We define:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$f_1 = P(c_1 - \\sum_{j=1}^n s_j A_{j,1}) = 0, \\dots, f_m = P(c_m - \\sum_{j=1}^n s_j A_{j,m}) = 0.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It holds that  <span class="math">\\langle f_1, \\ldots, f_m \\rangle</span>  is semi-regular (Definition 2, Section 2), i.e. has only trivial algebraic dependencies.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For general LWE, Assumption 1 is similar but we consider a polynomial  <span class="math">P(X) = X \\prod_{i=1}^{C_{GB} \\cdot \\sigma} (X+i)(X-i)</span> , where  <span class="math">C_{GB}</span>  depends on the parameters of the Gaussian distribution.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is believed that random systems of equations are semi-regular. Hence, our semi-regularity assumptions essentially state that our systems are neither easier nor harder to solve than random systems of equations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If the systems considered in this work were easier than random systems this would imply that the analysis of Section 5 could be much improved and lead to progress towards a sub-exponential classical algorithm for solving GAPSVP. On the other hand, if these systems were harder to solve than random systems, this would reveal new algebraic dependencies amongst LWE samples, which could likely also be used to improve (non-algebraic) solving strategies. Hence, our assumption in this paper that there is <em>no special structure</em> in our problem instances seems to be a reasonable one. We note also that Gröbner basis algorithms do not rely on this regularity assumption. Indeed, they have been successfully used in the past to exploit that a problem instance which does not behave like a semi-regular sequence [27].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Section 7.1 reports on our experimental verification that Assumptions 1 and 2 hold for reasonable parameter sets. For example, for BinaryError-LWE, we have verified them for  <span class="math">n \\le 100</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Fröberg's Conjecture. Our assumptions are closely related to the long-standing Fröberg conjecture [28] in algebraic geometry which states that semi-regular sequences form a dense subset among the set of all sequences. More precisely, the Fröberg conjecture states that <em>generically</em> the rank of some linear map associated to Macaulay matrices (the matrices occurring in a Gröbner basis computation) is maximal. A property is said to be generic if it holds on a Zariski open subset  <span class="math">Z_O</span>  when the characteristic of the base field  <span class="math">\\mathbb K</span>  is 0. In Zariski's topology, a closed subset is defined as the vanishing set of algebraic equations. Hence, we can find a polynomial  <span class="math">h(\\mathbf a)</span>  in  <span class="math">\\mathbb Z[\\mathbf a]</span>  which does not depend on the field  <span class="math">\\mathbb K</span>  such that  <span class="math">h(\\mathbf a) \\neq 0 \\Rightarrow \\mathbf a \\in Z_O</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The main difficulty in proving Fröberg's conjecture is to prove that the polynomial h is not identically zero or that  <span class="math">Z_O</span>  is not empty (see [29]).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To prove Fröberg's conjecture it is sufficient to find one explicit family of polynomials which can be proven semi-regular for any m and n. Proving Assumptions 1 or 2 would provide such family and hence prove Fröberg's conjecture. Furthermore, any non-trivial partial results on our assumptions would lead to progress on the general Fröberg's conjecture. over a sufficiently big finite field, sequences with the same number of polynomials (m) and same number of variables (n), m=n+1 in characteristic 0, m polynomials of degree 2 with  <span class="math">n \\le 11</span> , and m polynomials of degree 3 with  <span class="math">n \\le 8</span>  [20, 28, 29]. Indeed, Fröberg and Hollman [29] already investigated semi-regularity for powers of generic linear forms. In characteristic 0, [29, Lemma 2.1] proves that a sequence of n+1 squares of generic linear forms in n variables is generically semi-regular.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Section 7 we report on progress towards proving Fröberg conjecture by investigating our assumptions. In Theorem 8 (Section A.2), we first prove that the equations  <span class="math">f_1,\\ldots,f_m</span>  generated for BinaryError-LWE are linearly independent with high probability. Secondly, we show that the sequence  <span class="math">f_1,\\ldots,f_m</span>  is semigeneric (Definition 3), i.e.  <span class="math">\\{x_i\\cdot f_j\\}_{1\\leq i\\leq n}^{1\\leq j\\leq n}</span>  spans a vector space of maximal dimension. We prove that such algebraic independence at low degree holds with  <span class="math">m\\leq n+\\lfloor\\frac{n-2}{2}\\rfloor</span>  in Theorem 10. This improves on a result of [29, Theorem 2.2] where Fröberg and Hollman proved that the squares of m generic linear forms are semigeneric as long as  <span class="math">m\\leq n+15</span>  and  <span class="math">n\\leq 6</span> . Finally, we consider algebraic independence at higher degree and prove in Theorem 11 that BinaryError-LWE samples give rise to a semi-regular sequence with high probability for m=n+1 and for a sufficiently large field.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In closing, we note that Fröberg's conjecture is similar in spirit to the Gaussian Heuristic often relied on in the complexity analysis of lattice-reduction algorithms. For example, the complexity analysis of the currently best know heuristic CVP solver [11] mentioned above and predictions for the quality of output for the BKZ algorithm [18] rely on it. Where Fröberg's conjecture asserts that most ideals have a predictable degree of regularity, i.e. no special structure deviating from this expectation, the Gaussian Heuristic asserts that for most lattices the shortest vectors of random lattices have a predictable norm, i.e. no special structure deviating from this expectation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Open problems.</em> While computational commutative algebra provides a rich resource to improve on the results in [5] for solving LWE and variants thereof, our results indicate that it is unlikely that sub-exponential algorithms for solving LWE can be found by directly applying standard Gröbner basis algorithms to LWE. A promising avenue, however, is to combine geometric with algebraic techniques to improve our understanding of the hardness of LWE. Secondly, applying algebraic techniques to Ring-LWE, which offers a much richer algebraic structure, is an area for future work.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Lazard [32] showed that computing a Gröbner basis for a system of homogeneous polynomials  <span class="math">f_1 \\ldots, f_m</span>  is equivalent to perform Gaussian elimination on the  <span class="math">\\mathit{Macaulay matrices} \\mathcal{M}_{d,m}^{\\text{acaulay}}</span>  for d, where  <span class="math">\\min\\left(\\deg(f_1), \\ldots, \\deg(f_m)\\right) \\leq d \\leq D</span>  for some integer D. The Macaulay matrix  <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_{d,m}^{\\text{acaulay}}</span>  for a set of homogeneous polynomials  <span class="math">f_1 \\ldots, f_m</span>  is defined as the coefficient matrix of  <span class="math">(t_{i,j} \\cdot f_i)</span>  where  <span class="math">1 \\leq i \\leq m</span>  and  <span class="math">t_{i,j}</span>  runs through all monomials of degree  <span class="math">d - \\deg(f_i)</span> . It can be shown that Macaulay matrices up to degree d can be used to compute a partial Gröbner basis, called d-Gröbner basis. Lazard showed that for d big enough, a d-Gröbner basis is indeed a Gröbner basis:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 2</strong> ([32]). Let q be a prime and let  <span class="math">\\mathbf{f} = (f_1, \\ldots, f_m) \\in (\\mathbb{Z}_q[x_1, \\ldots, x_n])^m</span>  be homogeneous polynomials and  <span class="math">\\prec</span>  be a monomial ordering. There exists a positive integer D for which Gaussian elimination on all  <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_{d,m}^{\\mathrm{acaulay}}(f_1, \\ldots, f_m)</span>  matrices for  <span class="math">d, 1 \\leq d \\leq D</span>  computes a Gröbner basis of  <span class="math">\\langle f_1, \\ldots, f_m \\rangle</span>  w.r.t. to  <span class="math">\\prec</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It follows that the complexity of computing a Gröbner basis is bounded by the complexity of performing Gaussian elimination on the Macaulay matrices up to some degree D. In general, computing the maximum degree occurring in a Gröbner computation is a difficult problem. However, for a specific family of polynomial systems this degree is known [6-8, 10].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 2</strong> (Semi-regular Sequence [8,10]). Let  <span class="math">m \\ge n</span> , and  <span class="math">f_1, \\ldots, f_m \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q[x_1, \\ldots, x_n]</span>  be homogeneous polynomials of degrees  <span class="math">d_1, \\ldots, d_m</span>  respectively and  <span class="math">\\mathcal{I}</span>  the ideal generated by these polynomials. The system is said to be a semi-regular sequence if the Hilbert polynomial [19] associated to  <span class="math">\\mathcal{I}</span>  w.r.t. the grevlex order is:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$HP(z) = \\left[\\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^{m} (1 - z^{d_i})}{(1 - z)^n}\\right]_+,\\tag{2}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">with  <span class="math">[S]_+</span>  being the polynomial obtained by truncating the series S before the index of its first non-positive coefficient. We shall call degree of regularity of a semi-regular sequence the quantity:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$1 + \\deg(\\mathrm{HP}(z)).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This degree of regularity is the degree D involved in Theorem 2 for a semi-regular sequence.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, let  <span class="math">f_1, \\ldots, f_m \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q[x_1, \\ldots, x_n]</span>  be a sequence of affine polynomials. We denote by  <span class="math">f_1^H, \\ldots, f_m^H \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q[x_1, \\ldots, x_n]</span>  the corresponding homogeneous components of highest degree. We shall say that  <span class="math">f_1, \\ldots, f_m</span>  is semi-regular if the sequence  <span class="math">f_1^H, \\ldots, f_m^H</span>  is semi-regular.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Throughout this paper, we will use the following complexity results about computing Gröbner bases for semi-regular sequences.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Proposition 1</strong> (adapted from [9]). Let  <span class="math">\\mathbf{F} = (f_1, \\dots, f_m) \\in (\\mathbb{Z}_q[x_1, \\dots, x_n])^m</span>  be affine polynomials with m &gt; n. If  <span class="math">f_1, \\dots, f_m</span>  is semi-regular, then the number of operations in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}_q</span>  required to compute a Gröbner basis for any admissible order is bounded by:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathcal{O}\\left(m\\,D_{reg}\\begin{pmatrix}n+D_{reg}\\\\D_{reg}\\end{pmatrix}^{\\omega}\\right), as\\,D_{reg}\\to\\infty,</span>$
(3)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">2 \\le \\omega &lt; 3</span>  is the linear algebra constant and  <span class="math">D_{reg}</span>  is the degree of regularity of  <span class="math">\\langle f_1, \\ldots, f_m \\rangle</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In general, (3) only holds for the <em>grevlex</em> monomial ordering, but efficient algorithms exist to convert a Gröbner basis from one ordering to another [26]. However, in our case where m &gt; n we expect a unique solution which implies the Gröbner bases with respect to all monomial orderings are identical and the issue does not arise (cf. [12]).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The complexity bound (3) is pessimistic as we do not take the particular structure of the matrices involved into account. Typically, Macaulay matrices have huge rank defects which correspond to useless computations. More recent algorithms such as  <span class="math">F_4</span>  [23] and  <span class="math">F_5</span>  [24] take advantage of the structure of Macaulay matrices and avoid some or all of these useless computations. This leads to considerable speed-ups in practice [25, 27] and in theory [9]. However, to simplify the asymptotical analysis we apply Theorem 2 which performs row reductions on Macaulay matrices.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The following classical approximation of the binomial coefficient due to Stirling will be useful to prove some of our results below.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lemma 1.</strong> Let  <span class="math">H_2(x) = -x \\log_2(x) - (1-x) \\log_2(1-x)</span>  be the binary entropy. For n and k large enough, we have  <span class="math">\\log_2\\binom{n}{k} \\approx n \\, H_2(\\frac{k}{n})</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Similarly, we have the following lemma.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\log \\binom{n+D}{D} \\approx \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l} D\\log(n/D), \\ \\ if \\ D \\in o(n), \\\\ \\\\ n\\log(D/n), \\ \\ if \\ n \\in o(D). \\end{array} \\right.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This follows easily from Stirling's expansion of the binomial.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-4" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3 The Arora &amp; Ge Algorithm</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The Arora &amp; Ge algorithm proceeds by generating a non-linear system of (error-free) multivariate equations from LWE samples by making use of the following well-known fact about the Gaussian distribution.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lemma 3.</strong> Let  <span class="math">\\chi</span>  denote the Gaussian distribution with standard deviation  <span class="math">\\sigma</span> . Furthermore, for x &gt; 0, we denote  <span class="math">Q(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 - \\operatorname{erf} \\left( \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\right)</span> . Then, for all C &gt; 0, it holds that:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\Pr[e \\overset{\\</span>}{\\leftarrow} \\chi : |e| &gt; C \\cdot \\sigma] \\approx 2 \\times Q(C) \\le \\frac{2}{C\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-C^2/2} \\in e^{\\mathcal{O}\\left(-C^2\\right)}.$$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">That is, for a C&gt;0, elements sampled from a Gaussian distribution take only values on the interval  <span class="math">[-C\\cdot\\sigma,\\ldots,C\\cdot\\sigma]</span>  of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}_q</span>  with probability at least  <span class="math">1-e^{\\mathcal{O}\\left(-C^2\\right)}</span>  if we represent elements in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}_q</span>  as integers in  <span class="math">[-\\lfloor\\frac{q}{2}\\rfloor,\\ldots,\\lfloor\\frac{q}{2}\\rfloor]</span> . Moreover, if  <span class="math">e \\stackrel{\\</span>}{\\leftarrow} \\chi$  then P(e)=0 for</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$P(X) = X \\prod_{i=1}^{C \\cdot \\sigma} (X+i)(X-i),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">with probability at least  <span class="math">1 - e^{\\mathcal{O}\\left(-C^2\\right)}</span> . Clearly P is of degree  <span class="math">2C \\cdot \\sigma + 1 \\in \\mathcal{O}\\left(C \\cdot \\sigma\\right)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It follows that if  <span class="math">(\\mathbf{a}_i, b_i) = (\\mathbf{a}_i, \\langle \\mathbf{a}_i, \\mathbf{s} \\rangle + e_i) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q^n \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q</span> , and  <span class="math">e_i \\stackrel{\\</span>}{\\leftarrow} \\chi$ , then</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$P(-b + \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (\\mathbf{a}_i)_{(j)} x_j) = 0,</span>$
(4)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">with probability at least  <span class="math">1 - e^{\\mathcal{O}\\left(-C^2\\right)}</span> . Each sample  <span class="math">(\\mathbf{a}_i, \\langle \\mathbf{a}_i, \\mathbf{s} \\rangle + e_i) = (\\mathbf{a}_i, b_i) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q^n \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q</span>  allows to generate a non-linear equation of degree  <span class="math">2C \\cdot \\sigma + 1</span>  in the n components of the secret  <span class="math">\\mathbf{s}</span>  which holds with probability  <span class="math">1 - e^{\\mathcal{O}\\left(-C^2\\right)}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The Arora &amp; Ge algorithm then proceeds by generating  <span class="math">M_{\\rm AG}</span>  independent equations of the form (4), to be then solved by linearisation. However, a value for C – denoted by  <span class="math">C_{\\rm AG}</span>  – occurring in Lemma 3 has to be chosen sufficiently large so that all errors  <span class="math">e_i</span>  lie with high probability in the interval  <span class="math">[-C_{\\rm AG} \\cdot \\sigma, \\ldots, C_{\\rm AG} \\cdot \\sigma] \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_q</span> , i.e. such that the secret s is indeed a common solution of the  <span class="math">M_{\\rm AG}</span>  equations. To this end, let  <span class="math">\\mathcal{S}_{\\rm AG}</span>  be the system of equations generated from  <span class="math">M_{\\rm AG}</span>  equations as in (4) and bound the probability of failure by the union bound:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$p_f = M_{\\mathrm{AG}} \\times \\Pr[e \\overset{\\</span>}{\\leftarrow} \\chi_{\\alpha,q} : |e| &gt; C_{\\mathrm{AG}} \\cdot \\sigma] \\le \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{AG}}}{e^{\\mathcal{O}\\left(C_{\\mathrm{AG}}^2\\right)}}.$$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Hence,  <span class="math">p_f</span>  is an upper bound on the probability that the secret  <span class="math">\\mathbf{s} \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q^n</span>  is not a solution to  <span class="math">\\mathcal{S}_{AG}</span> . Let also  <span class="math">D_{AG} = 2\\,C_{AG}\\,\\sigma + 1</span>  be the degree of the equations occuring in  <span class="math">\\mathcal{S}_{AG}</span> . It is shown in [5] (cf. Section 4) that taking  <span class="math">C_{AG} \\in \\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sigma)</span>  allows us to make the probability of failure negligible.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In summary, the Arora &amp; Ge algorithm reduces solving LWE to linearisation of a system of  <span class="math">M_{\\rm AG}</span>  equations of degree  <span class="math">D_{\\rm AG}=2\\,C_{\\rm AG}\\,\\sigma+1\\in\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sigma^2)</span> . In particular, the following theorem holds:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 3</strong> ([5]). Let  <span class="math">D_{\\rm AG} &lt; q</span> . The system obtained by linearizing</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">equations as in (4) has at most one solution with high probability.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that  <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\binom{n+D_{\\mathrm{AG}}}{D_{\\mathrm{AG}}}\\right)</span>  equations is sufficient to linearise the system. The extra factor  <span class="math">\\sigma q \\log q</span>  allows to prove that the linearised system has at most one solution with high probability [5]. The overall complexity</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">of the Arora-Ge algorithm is the cost of performing Gaussian elimination on a matrix of size  <span class="math">M_{\\rm AG} \\times \\binom{n+D_{\\rm AG}}{D_{\\rm AG}}</span> , i.e.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$C_{\\mathrm{AG}}^{\\mathrm{plx}} = n^{\\mathcal{O}(D_{\\mathrm{AG}})} = 2^{\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sigma^2)} = 2^{\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{2\\epsilon})}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note also that, if we have the standard deviation  <span class="math">\\sigma=n^\\epsilon</span> , then the algorithm requires  <span class="math">2^{\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{2\\epsilon})}</span>  LWE samples for performing the linearisation step. It follows that the Arora &amp; Ge algorithm is subexponential when  <span class="math">\\epsilon&lt;1/2</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We note that the analysis above and in [5] leaves much room for improvements, as it hides not only constants <em>in the exponent</em> but also logarithm factors. In this section, we make a more refined analysis of the complexity of the Arora &amp; Ge algorithm when using the linearisation method, so that we can then compare potential improvements due to the application of Gröbner bases in Section 5.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As established in the previous section, the overall complexity of solving an LWE instance with the Arora &amp; Ge algorithm is that of executing Gaussian elimination on a matrix of size  <span class="math">M_{\\rm AG} \\times \\binom{n+D_{\\rm AG}}{D_{\\rm AG}}</span> . Gaussian elimination on an  <span class="math">m \\times n</span>  matrix of rank r has complexity  <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}\\left(mnr^{\\omega-2}\\right)</span>  [31]. The Arora &amp; Ge algorithm hence has a complexity of</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We now consider the bound on  <span class="math">C_{AG}</span> .</p>

Let  <span class="math">p_f&#x27; \\in [0,1]</span>  be a constant upper bound on the probability of failure and</p>

Finally, let also  <span class="math">D_{\\rm AG}=2\\,C_{\\rm AG}\\,\\sigma+1</span> . Then, the system obtained by linearizing  <span class="math">\\binom{n+D_{\\rm AG}}{D_{\\rm AG}}\\sigma</span>  q log q equations of degree as in (4) is correct, i.e. the secret is a zero of all the polynomials, with probability bigger than  <span class="math">1-p_f&#x27;</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof.</em> The probability of failure is upper bounded by:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we address the natural question of whether the complexity of the basic Arora &amp; Ge algorithm can be improved by using Gröbner basis algorithms instead of the linearisation method.

Hence, on the one hand, we may lower the number of equations to a value lower than  <span class="math">\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{2\\,\\epsilon})</span>  whilst keeping the probability of failure small enough.

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Assumption 1</strong> Let  <span class="math">(\\mathbf{a}_1, b_1), \\ldots, (\\mathbf{a}_{M_{\\mathrm{GB}}}, b_{M_{\\mathrm{GB}}})</span>  be elements of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}_q^n \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q</span>  sampled according to  <span class="math">\\mathrm{LWE}_{\\chi_{\\alpha,q}}</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">Then,  <span class="math">\\langle f_1, \\ldots, f_m \\rangle</span>  is semi-regular.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We justify this assumption in Section 7.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">From  <span class="math">D_{\\rm GB}</span>  and  <span class="math">M_{\\rm GB}</span>  we now need to establish the degree of regularity. Whilst there are classical results on the degree of regularity in the literature, these do not apply here. In particular, we need to consider systems of equations having a non-constant degree. For brevity and due to the fact a detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this paper, we only provide the general statement which allows to derive the result below in Appendix A (Proposition 3).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lemma 6.</strong> Let  <span class="math">A \\ge 1</span> , and  <span class="math">f_1, \\ldots, f_m \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q[x_1, \\ldots, x_n]</span>  be semi-regular polynomials of degree  <span class="math">\\frac{n}{A}</span> , and  <span class="math">D_{\\text{reg}}</span>  be the degree of regularity of these polynomials.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that the complexities in Theorem 5 are minimized by taking a constant A=1.

Thus, our analysis shows that using Gröbner</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">bases yields an exponential speed-up (for  <span class="math">\\sigma=\\sqrt{n}/\\sqrt{2\\pi}</span>  and under Assumption 1) over the basic Arora-Ge approach (cf. Theorem 4). On the slightly negative side, our results also give a negative answer to the natural question whether the combination of Gröner basis techniques with the Arora-Ge modelling can yield a subexponential algorithm for the LWE problem&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;: from Lemma 6, one can notice that there is no choice of A (constant,  <span class="math">\\log n, \\ldots</span> ) which makes the number of samples sub-exponential whilst keeping the degree of regularity sub-linear.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-6" class="text-2xl font-bold">6 Solving LWE with Bounded Errors</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We now turn to studying the complexity of solving BinaryError-LWE using the modelling of Arora &amp; Ge [5] and applying a Gröbner basis algorithm for solving the resulting system of equations. As discussed earlier, BinaryError-LWE is an LWE instance over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}_q</span>  but with errors restricted to the binary field [35]. This variant is particularly attractive for real-world practical implementations of LWE-based cryptographic schemes. Generating noise-free non-linear equations for BinaryError-LWE is straightforward: if  <span class="math">\\mathbf{e} = (e_1, \\dots, e_m) \\in \\{0, 1\\}^m</span>  and P(X) = X(X - 1), then we have  <span class="math">P(e_i) = 0</span> , for all i, 1 &lt; i &lt; m.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Now, let  <span class="math">(G, \\mathbf{s} \\times G + \\mathbf{e}) = (G, \\mathbf{c}) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q^{n \\times m} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q^m</span>  be sampled according to  <span class="math">L_{\\mathbf{s}, \\mathcal{U}(\\mathbb{F}_2)}^{(n)}</span> . Then</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&lt;sup&gt;&amp;&lt;/sup&gt;lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Which was, admittedly, one of our original motivations to consider Gröbner basis algorithms as an alternative to linearisation in the original Arora &amp; Ge method.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This is an algebraic system of m quadratic equations in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}_q[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]</span> . As already pointed out in [5,35], this system can be solved using linearization if  <span class="math">m=\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^2\\right)</span> . However the case  <span class="math">m&lt;\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^2\\right)</span>  remained untreated. Here, we address this problem of evaluating the complexity of solving the algebraic system (7) with an arbitrary number m of equations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As discussed in Section 2, answering this question in general is hard. But for one particular class of systems, namely <em>semi-regular systems of equations</em>, this question has in fact been settled. In particular, the following result [6–8, 10] allows us to classify the complexity of solving polynomial systems with respect to the number of equations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 6.</strong> (i) Let  <span class="math">m = C \\cdot n</span> , with C &gt; 1, and let  <span class="math">f_1, \\ldots, f_m \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q[x_1, \\ldots, x_n]</span>  be a semi-regular system of equations.

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">a_1 \\approx 2.3381</span>  is the largest zero of the classical Airy function.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(ii) Let  <span class="math">m = n \\cdot \\log^{1/\\epsilon}(n)</span> , for any constant  <span class="math">\\epsilon &gt; 0</span> , or  <span class="math">m = n \\log \\log n</span> . The degree of regularity of  <span class="math">f_1, \\ldots, f_m</span>  behaves asymptotically as:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$D_{\\text{reg}} = \\frac{n^2}{8m} (1 + o(1)).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A proof of i) can be found, for instance, in [10, Theorem 1]. A proof similar to the case of ii) can be found in [7]. However, there is slight difference between [7] (binary fields) and our case (generic prime fields). In Appendix A we briefly sketch a proof for ii) of Theorem 6.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Hence, under the assumption that the system (7) behaves like a semi-regular system of equations, Theorem 6 allows one to compute an upper bound on the complexity for solving it with Gröbner basis algorithms. While no proof currently exists that would demonstrate that the system (7) does indeed behave like a semi-regular system, we make the following assumption based on the discussion in Section 7.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Assumption 2</strong> Let  <span class="math">(G, \\mathbf{s} \\times G + \\mathbf{e}) = (G, \\mathbf{c}) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q^{n \\times m} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q^m</span>  be sampled according to  <span class="math">L_{\\mathbf{s}, \\mathcal{U}(\\mathbb{F}_2)}^{(n)}</span> , and let P(x) = X(X - 1). We define:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$f_1 = P(c_1 - \\sum_{j=1}^n s_j G_{j,1}) = 0, \\dots, f_m = P(c_n - \\sum_{j=1}^n s_j G_{j,m}) = 0.</span>$

The first one corresponds to the number of equations required in the security proof [35, Theorem 1.2].

    <h2 id="sec-7" class="text-2xl font-bold">7 Justifications of our Assumptions</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The results in this work depend crucially on two assumptions, namely that all systems of equations occurring in this work are semi-regular, i.e. have no special structure. While no full proof currently exists that would demonstrate either Assumption 1 or 2, we argue below why it is reasonable to believe that these assumptions hold. Each semi-regularity assumption essentially states that our systems are not easier and not harder to solve than a random system of equations and reiterate that if these systems were easier than random systems this would imply that the analysis of Section 5 could be much improved and lead to progress towards a subexponential classical algorithm for solving Bounded Distance Decoding. Furthermore, this subexponential classical algorithm would work despite ignoring the particular error distribution and would consist of applying a generic Grobner basis algorithm. We consider this case to be unlikely. Furthermore, ¨ we note that Arora and Ge showed in [5] that Assumption 1 holds for m = 2O˜(&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; ) (Theorem 3).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Following [5], we prove that Assumption 2 holds for m = O n 2 in Section A.2. We also prove several partial results regarding our assumptions in Section A.2 and present experimental evidencethat these assumptions hold for reasonably large parameters in Section 7.1.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-8" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">7.1 Experimental Verification</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We experimentally confirmed that our assumptions hold for reasonably large parameters. Namely, we verified Assumption 1 for systems up to n = 8 variables. In particular we computed for n = 8 and m = 256, α·q/&lt;sup&gt;√&lt;/sup&gt; 2π = 1 using MAGMA [13] (V2.20-4) and Sage [41]. The generated system of equations has degree 9 and the degree of semi-regularity is 13. The highest degree reached was indeed degree 13.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">While n ≤ 8 might seem rather small, we point out that it is the last n for which we can reasonably expect to run experiments on current hardware. Theorem 5 bounds the memory complexity by O 2 5.85n . We note that for n = 8, our computation required 65GB of memory and 68 hours to complete. Hence, we would require about 2 5.85 · 65GB of memory to perform this computation for n = 9 which is beyond our reach.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To verify Assumption 2, we generated systems as in (8). We took q as the next prime larger than n (or n 2 in some instances). We then computed a Grobner basis of the equations using M ¨ AGMA. Below we report the maximal degree reached Dreal in our experiments, and the theoretical degree of regularity Dreg, as given by Assumption 2. We note that the largest of these experiments took 7 days to complete.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-9" class="text-2xl font-bold">A Appendix</h2>

    <h2 id="sec-10" class="text-2xl font-bold">A.1 Degree of Regularity</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The proof of Theorem 6-ii) is derived from the following more general result.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proposition 2. <em>Let</em> &gt; 0<em>, and</em> F(n) ∈ {log1/(n), log log n}<em>. Assuming</em> m = F(n) n<em>, then the degree of regularity of a system of quadratic semi-regular equations</em> f1, . . . , f&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; ∈ Zq[x1, . . . , xn] <em>behaves asymptotically as:</em></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$D_{\\text{reg}} = \\left( F(n) - 1/2 - \\sqrt{F^2(n) - F(n)} \\right) n = \\frac{1}{8} \\frac{n}{F(n)} + \\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{n}{F^2(n)}\\right).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof.</em> We assume that we have m quadratic equations in n variables. In this case, we have to consider the Hilbert series:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$H_{m,n}(z) = \\frac{(1-z^2)^m}{(1-z)^n} = \\sum_{d=0}^{\\infty} h_d z^d.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The degree of regularity is the index Dreg such that h&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;reg &lt; 0. We try to find Dreg = <code>(n) n = </code> n such that h\` n &lt; 0. To do so, we consider :</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$h_{\\ell n} = \\oint \\frac{\\mathbf{H}_{m,n}(z)}{z^{\\ell n}} dz = \\oint e^{f(z) n} dz,</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where the contour is a circle centered in 0 whose radius is smaller than 1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In our context:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$f(z) = \\frac{\\log(\\mathcal{H}_{m,n}(z))}{n} = \\frac{m\\log\\left(1-z^2\\right) - n\\log\\left(1-z\\right) - n\\,\\ell\\,\\log\\left(z\\right)}{n}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Laplace's Method gives then:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$h_{\\ell n} \\approx \\sum_{\\{a|f&#x27;(a)=0\\}} e^{f(a)n}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">More details about this preliminary part can be found in the literature, for instance [6–8,10]. As n increases, the integral concentrates in the neighbourhood of one or several saddle points, i.e. the solutions of f &lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">ut</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">When the equation f 0 (z) = 0 has two solutions, we have h<code>n ≈ e f(z &lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; + e f(z &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; → ∞. Hence, since when d = Dreg =</code> n we must have h&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 this implies that the equation f 0 (z) = 0 has a multiple root. In our case, we have:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A technical difficulty for proving results towards Fröberg's conjecture is that over a finite field the notion of Zariski open set is meaningless due to the field equations. However, the notion of genericity can be understood via the classical Schwartz-Zippel-DeMillo-Lipton lemma [21, 40, 43].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lemma 7</strong> (Schwartz, Zippel, DeMillo, Lipton [21, 40, 43]). Let  <span class="math">\\mathbb{K}</span>  be a field and  <span class="math">P \\in \\mathbb{K}[x_1, \\dots, x_n]</span>  be a non-zero polynomial. Select  <span class="math">r_1, \\dots, r_n</span>  uniformly at random from a finite subset  <span class="math">\\mathcal{X}</span>  of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{K}</span> . Then, the probability that  <span class="math">P(r_1, \\dots, r_n) = 0</span>  is less than  <span class="math">\\deg(P)/|\\mathcal{X}|</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Linear Independence.</strong> Assumption 2 for BinaryError-LWE implies in particular that the equations (8) are linearly independent with high probability which we prove below for any  <span class="math">1 \\le m \\le \\binom{n+1}{2}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof.</em> The coefficients of the  <span class="math">f_i</span> s can be viewed as polynomials of degree  <span class="math">\\leq 2</span>  in the components of the matrix A. We denote the number of monomials of degree 2 by N, and by  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Mac}_2</span>  the  <span class="math">m \\times N</span>  matrix whose rows are the coefficients of the  <span class="math">f_i^H</span> s. This is the Macaulay matrix of the  <span class="math">f_i^H</span> s at degree 2. We assume that the monomials are sorted with respect to a graded reverse lexicographical order. Let  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Mat}_2</span>  be a  <span class="math">m \\times m</span>  sub-matrix of  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Mac}_2</span> . We can view  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Det}(\\operatorname{Mat}_2)</span>  as a polynomial p of degree 2m whose variables are the components of A. According to Lemma 9 (Appendix A.3), the polynomial p is non-zero for all  <span class="math">1 \\leq m \\leq \\binom{n+1}{2}</span> . The Schwartz-Zippel-DeMillo-Lipton Lemma (Lemma 7) yields that  <span class="math">p(A) \\neq 0</span>  with probability  <span class="math">\\geq 1 - \\frac{2m}{g}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that the notion of semi-genericity only depends on the homogeneous components of highest degree. Thus, the polynomial P in Theorem 8 can be replaced by  <span class="math">X^2</span>  and the proof would remain the same. By a similar argument the constants  <span class="math">c_i</span> s are not relevant to the proof. This illustrates that it is equivalent to consider the semi-regularity of the systems as in Assumption 2 or the semi-regularity of the square of linear forms as done by Fröberg and Hollman [29].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A consequence of Theorem 8 is:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Corollary 1.</strong> Let q &gt; 2m. There is a polynomial-time algorithm solving BinaryError-LWE with probability  <span class="math">1 - \\frac{2m}{q}</span>  as soon as  <span class="math">n &lt; m \\le \\binom{n+1}{2}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In [35] it was already mentioned that BinaryErrors-LWE can be solved in polynomial-time as soon as the number of samples is  <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^2\\right)</span> , albeit no proof was given. In particular, a direct adaptation of [5, Theorem 3.1] to BinaryErrors-LWE gives:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 9.</strong> Let  <span class="math">(A, \\mathbf{s} \\cdot A + \\mathbf{e}) = (A, \\mathbf{c}) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q^{n \\times m} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q^m</span>  be sampled according to  <span class="math">L_{\\mathbf{s}, \\mathcal{U}(\\mathbb{F}_2)}^{(n)}</span> , and let P(x) = X(X-1). The system obtained by linearizing the  <span class="math">f_i</span> 's, as defined in (15), has unique solution with probability  <span class="math">\\geq 1 - 2^m \\cdot q^{N_2 - m}</span> , with  <span class="math">N_2 = \\binom{n+2}{2}</span> . The bound is then non-trivial (&lt; 1) if  <span class="math">m \\geq cN_2</span> , for some constant c &gt; 0.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof.</em> We know that  <span class="math">\\mathbf{s} \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q^n</span>  is a solution of  <span class="math">f_1, \\dots, f_m</span> . Given  <span class="math">\\mathbf{s}&#x27; \\neq \\mathbf{s}</span> , the idea is to bound the probability that  <span class="math">\\mathbf{s}&#x27;</span>  vanishes simultaneously the linearised system corresponding to  <span class="math">f_1, \\dots, f_m</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">By definition,  <span class="math">\\mathbf{c} = (\\mathbf{s} \\cdot A) + \\mathbf{e}</span> . So, we can write:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$f_i = P(e_i - \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (\\mathbf{s}_j - x_j) A_{j,i}).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Now by setting  <span class="math">x_j^* = (\\mathbf{s}_j - x_j)</span> , we have:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Thus,  <span class="math">\\exists \\mathbf{s}&#x27; \\neq \\mathbf{s}</span>  such that  <span class="math">f_i(\\mathbf{s}&#x27;) = 0 \\iff \\exists</span>  a non-zero  <span class="math">\\mathbf{s}^* \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q^n</span>  such that  <span class="math">f_i^*(\\mathbf{s}^*) = 0</span> . We can view  <span class="math">f_i^*(\\mathbf{s}^*)</span>  has a multivariate polynomial of degree 2 in the components of A. Thus, assuming that  <span class="math">f_i^*(\\mathbf{s}^*)</span>  is non-identically zero, it holds that:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathrm{Pr}_{(A,\\mathbf{c})\\leftarrow_{\\</span>}L_{\\mathbf{s},\\mathcal{U}(\\mathbb{F}_2)}^{(n)}}\\big(f_i^<em>(\\mathbf{s}^</em>)=0\\mid \\mathbf{e}_i=b\\big)\\leq 2/q, \\text{ with } b\\in{0,1}.$$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The fact that the  <span class="math">f_i^*(\\mathbf{s}^*)</span>  is a non-zero polynomial – viewed as a polynomial whose variables in the components of A follows easily from [5, Lemma 3.4].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Semigenericity. Following the terminology in [29], we consider the notion of semigenericity.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 3.</strong> Let  <span class="math">f_1, \\ldots, f_m \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q[x_1, \\ldots, x_n]</span>  be homogeneous equations of degree d.

    <p class="text-gray-300">For BinaryError-LWE, this corresponds to investigate Assumption 2 for Macaulay matrices at degree 3.

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof.</em> Let N be the number of monomials of degree 3 and let  <span class="math">\\mathrm{Mat}_3</span>  be a sub-matrix of size  <span class="math">m \\cdot n \\times m \\cdot n</span>  of the Macaulay matrix  <span class="math">f_1^\\mathrm{H}, \\ldots, f_m^\\mathrm{H}</span>  at degree 3.

    <p class="text-gray-300">By inspecting the terms in bold, it can be noticed that they are all distinct.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Example 4</strong> For n = 5,  <span class="math">G^* = G_1 || G_2</span>  is as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Remark 2.</em> We emphasize that we have found an example which extends Lemma 11. We construct a matrix G := G1kG2k · · · kGn. The matrices G&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and G&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are defined as in Lemma 11. Each block Gb, b &gt; 2 will be of size n × j n−b &lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;+1 &lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; and such that all the coefficients are zero except for :</p>

      <li><span class="math">$G_2[b,j]=1</span>$

      <li><span class="math">G_2[j(b+1),j]=G_2[b\\cdot j+2,j]=1,\\cdots,G_2[j(b+1)+b,j]</span> , for all  <span class="math">j,1 \\leq j \\leq \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n-b}{b+1} \\right\\rfloor</span> .</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We perform experiments to verify that such G yields semigeneric systems. We have been able to verify the assumption up to n = 100. However, we have not been able to prove that such family is semigeneric. This would allow to prove semigenericity for m ≈ n &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/ log n.</p>

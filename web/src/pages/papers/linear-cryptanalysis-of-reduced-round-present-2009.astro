    <p class="text-gray-300">Abstract. PRESENT is a hardware-oriented block cipher suitable for resource constrained environment. In this paper we analyze PRESENT by the multidimensional linear cryptanalysis method. We claim that our attack can recover the 80-bit secret key of PRESENT up to 25 rounds out of 31 rounds with around <span class="math">2^{62.4}</span> data complexity. Furthermore, we showed that the 26-round version of PRESENT can be attacked faster than key exhaustive search with the <span class="math">2^{64}</span> data complexity by an advanced key search technique. Our results are superior to all the previous attacks. We demonstrate our result by performing the linear attacks on reduced variants of PRESENT. Our results exemplify that the performance of the multidimensional linear attack is superior compared to the classical linear attack.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">PRESENT [3] is a lightweight SPN block cipher proposed by Bogdanov et al. at CHES 2007. PRESENT is designed for resource restricted applications such as RFID and sensor networks. Due to the impressive hardware performance and the strong security, PRESENT has drawn a lot of attention from the lightweight cryptographic community.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">On the other hand, the cryptanalysis on PRESENT has been also actively performed so far. In [15], Wang presented a differential cryptanalysis that could attack the 16-round variant with <span class="math">2^{64}</span> chosen texts and <span class="math">2^{65}</span> memory accesses. In [1], Albrecht et al. presented a differential attack using algebraic techniques that can recover a 80-bit key of the 16-round variant with similar complexity to [15] and a 128-bit key of the 19-round variant by <span class="math">2^{113}</span> computations. In [4], Collard et al. presented a statistical saturation attack that can recover the key of the 24 round variant with <span class="math">2^{57}</span> chosen texts and <span class="math">2^{57}</span> time complexity under the condition that the parts of plaintexts are fixed to a constant value. More recently, Ohkuma presented a linear attack on 24-round variant using weak keys with <span class="math">2^{63.5}</span> known texts [13].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper, we analyze PRESENT by a multidimensional linear attack method. We observe that PRESENT has a large number of linear approximations that hold with the same order of magnitude of correlations due to the simple structure of the round function <span class="math">^{1}</span>. As shown in [7], a multidimensional linear attack can be efficiently applied to such cipher. According to our analysis, the 25-round variant of PRESENT using the 80-bit key can be attacked faster than key exhaustive search with around <span class="math">2^{62.4}</span> data complexity. Furthermore, an advanced key search technique enables us to attack the 26-round version of PRESENT with <span class="math">2^{64}</span> data complexity. Our results are superior to all the previous attacks presented in</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">1 Similar observation was independently presented in [13].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">the open literature. We demonstrate our claim by performing the multidimensional linear attacks on reduced variants of PRESENT.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the structure of PRESENT is briefly described and the framework of multidimensional linear attack is presented. In Section 3, linear characteristics are derived and their capacities are computed. In Section 4, the attack algorithm using linear characteristics is described. In Section 5, our attacks are applied to reduced variants of PRESENT and the experimental results are presented. Section 6 concludes this paper.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">PRESENT is a SPN block cipher that consists of 31 rounds. The encryption block length is 64 bits and the key lengths is 80 bits or 128 bits. Each of the 31 rounds consists of three layers: addRoundKey, SboxLayer and pLayer. The AddRoundKey is a 64-bit eXclusiveOR operation with a round key. The SboxLayer is a 64-bit nonlinear transform using a single S-box 16 times in parallel. The S-box is a nonlinear bijective mapping  <span class="math">S: \\mathbb{F}_2^4 \\mapsto \\mathbb{F}_2^4</span>  given in Table 4. The pLayer is a bit-by-bit permutation  <span class="math">P: \\mathbb{F}_2^{64} \\mapsto \\mathbb{F}_2^{64}</span>  given in Table 5. The design idea of SboxLayer and pLayer is adapted from Serpent [2] and DES block cipher [10], respectively. The structure of PRESENT is illustrated in Figure 1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The key scheduling algorithm has two versions depending on whether the key size is 80 bits or 128 bits. Since the key schedule is not directly relevant to out attack, we do not describe the key schedule algorithm here. For complete description of PRESENT we refer to the paper [3].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Multidimensional linear cryptanalysis is an extension of Matsui's classical linear cryptanalysis [9] in which multiple linear approximations are optimally exploited. The general framework of the multidimensional linear cryptanalysis adapting Matsui's algorithm 2 was presented by Hermelin et al. in [8]. In their paper, Hermelin et al. studied two statistic methods:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) and the <span class="math">\\chi^{2}</span>. We apply the <span class="math">\\chi^{2}</span> statistic method to PRESENT since the LLR method is not proper to PRESENT-like structure. The detailed explanation will be given in Section 4.4.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The brief framework of the <span class="math">\\chi^{2}</span> method is as follows. Let <span class="math">V_{n}</span> denote the space of <span class="math">n</span>-dimensional binary vectors. A function <span class="math">f:V_{n}\\rightarrow V_{m}</span> with <span class="math">f=(f_{1},\\cdots,f_{m})</span> where <span class="math">f_{i}</span> is a linear approximation is called a vectorial linear approximation of the dimension <span class="math">m</span>. The correlation of <span class="math">f_{i}</span> is defined as <span class="math">c(f_{i})=2^{-n}\\left[\\#(f_{i}(a)=0)-\\#(f_{i}(a)=1)\\right]</span> where <span class="math">a\\in V_{n}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">p</span> be the probability distribution of <span class="math">m</span>-dimensional linear approximations. The capacity of <span class="math">p=(p_{0},\\ldots,p_{2^{m}-1})</span> is defined by <span class="math">C_{p}=\\sum_{i=0}^{2^{m}-1}\\frac{(p_{i}-u_{i})^{2}}{u_{i}}</span> where <span class="math">u=(u_{0},\\ldots,u_{2^{m}-1})</span> is the uniform distribution. It is well known that the <span class="math">C_{p}</span> is equal to the sum of the square of correlations of all <span class="math">2^{m}-1</span> linear approximations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Suppose <span class="math">l</span> is the length of the target key. For all values of <span class="math">k\\in[0,2^{l}-1]</span>, one obtains the empirical probability distributions <span class="math">Q_{k}=(q_{k,0},\\ldots,q_{k,2^{m}-1})</span> by measuring the frequency of <span class="math">m</span>-dimensional vectors which are Boolean values of <span class="math">m</span> linear independent approximations. Then the candidate keys are sorted according to their <span class="math">\\chi^{2}</span>-statistics defined as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\mathcal{D}(k)=2^{m}\\sum_{i=0}^{M}(q_{k,i}-2^{-m})^{2},\\quad M=2^{m}-1</span> (1)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">which represents the <span class="math">l_{2}</span>-distance of the <span class="math">Q_{k}</span> from the uniform distribution.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If the right key is ranked in the position of <span class="math">d</span> from the top out of <span class="math">2^{l}</span> key candidates, we say that the attack has the advantage of <span class="math">(l-\\log_{2}d)</span> <em>[14]</em>. The advantage of the <span class="math">\\chi^{2}</span>-method using statistic (1) is derived in Theorem 1 in <em>[8]</em> by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">advantage=\\frac{(NC_{p}-4\\Phi^{-2}(2P_{s}-1))^{2}}{8M},\\quad\\Phi(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{x}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-t^{2}/2}dt</span> (2)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">P_{s}</span> is the success probability, <span class="math">N</span> is the amount of data and <span class="math">C</span> is the capacity.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-6" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2.3 Notations</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">S_{i}</span> denote the <span class="math">i</span>-th S-box in the SboxLayer and <span class="math">P</span> denote the permutation in the pLayer. Let <span class="math">K_{r}</span> denote the <span class="math">r</span>-th round key and <span class="math">K_{r}^{[i]}</span> denote the <span class="math">i</span>-th bit of the <span class="math">K_{r}</span>. The <span class="math">K_{r}^{[i..j]}</span> denote the bit string from <span class="math">K_{r}^{[i]}</span> to <span class="math">K_{r}^{[j]}</span>. We use <span class="math">E_{K}(X)</span> for representing the average value of <span class="math">X</span> over all possible values of <span class="math">K</span>. In our notation of the bit masks, we identify <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2}^{4}</span> with <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}_{16}</span>. We use the little endian for bit notation through the paper, that is, the least significant bit is counted at the rightmost.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-7" class="text-2xl font-bold">3 Linear Characteristics of PRESENT</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We define a linear trail as a single path of linear approximations concatenated over multiple rounds. It is a common belief that the linear characteristic with multiple linear trails has a larger correlation than one with a single linear trail due to the linear hull effect <em>[11]</em>. In this section, we derive a linear characteristic of PRESENT that has multiple linear trails. Each linear trail exploits the linear approximations of S-boxes which have a single active bit in the input and output masks. The linear masks having more than one active bits affect at least two S-boxes in the consecutive round due to the permutation layer, which yield much less correlations in the multiple rounds of PRESENT.</p>

    <h6 id="sec-8" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Definition 1</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A single-bit linear trail is a linear trail where the input and output masks of linear approximations of all intermediate S-boxes are of Hamming weight one.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We call a single-bit linear trail as just a linear trail unless specified otherwise.</p>

The correlation of <span class="math">\\pi(\\alpha,\\beta)</span> is denoted by <span class="math">\\rho(\\alpha,\\beta)</span>. We observe that the S-box has the following properties:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For <span class="math">\\alpha,\\beta\\in\\{2,4,8\\}</span>, <span class="math">\\rho(\\alpha,\\beta)=\\pm 2^{-2}</span> except that <span class="math">\\rho(8,4)=0</span>; For <span class="math">\\alpha\\in\\{1,2,4,8\\}</span>, <span class="math">\\rho(\\alpha,1)=\\rho(1,\\alpha)=0</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">According to Property S1 and S2, the S-box holds eight linear approximations which has a single active bit in both the input and output linear masks.</p>

For a positive integer <span class="math">n</span>, the expected capacity of <span class="math">U \\circ \\Omega^{(n)} \\circ V</span> over the secret key <span class="math">K</span> is</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof. Let <span class="math">\\alpha_{i}</span> be an input mask of <span class="math">S_{i} \\in \\{S_{5}, S_{9}, S_{13}\\}</span> of the <span class="math">U</span> and <span class="math">\\beta_{j}</span> be an output mask of <span class="math">S_{j} \\in \\{S_{5}, S_{6}, S_{7}\\}</span> of the <span class="math">V</span>.

Similarly, for a fixed <span class="math">\\beta_{j}</span>, the <span class="math">V</span> has nine linear trails with the correlations of <span class="math">\\rho(2^{v}, \\beta_{j}) \\cdot 2^{-2}</span> for some <span class="math">v \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}</span>. We define <span class="math">B[\\alpha_{i}]</span> and <span class="math">B[\\beta_{j}]</span> as the sets of input and output bit positions where <span class="math">\\Omega^{(n)}</span> is linked with <span class="math">U</span> and <span class="math">V</span> for fixed <span class="math">\\alpha_{i}</span> and <span class="math">\\beta_{j}</span>, respectively. Obviously, <span class="math">\\#B[\\alpha_{i}] = \\#B[\\beta_{j}] = 9</span> for any <span class="math">\\alpha_{i}</span> and <span class="math">\\beta_{j}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Suppose  <span class="math">n</span>  is a positive integer. The dimension of input and output masks of the  <span class="math">U \\circ \\Omega^{(n)} \\circ V</span>  is  <span class="math">4 \\times 3 = 12</span>  each. As mentioned before, the linear trails passing more than one S-boxes at each round have much less correlations than single-bit linear trails. Thus, it is sufficient to take nine linear characteristics individually, each of which has 8-dimensional linear characteristic with 4-bit input and 4-bit output. Then, the number of linear approximations spanned for our attack is  <span class="math">9 \\times (2^8 - 1)</span>  in total.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We use eight unit vectors as the linear independent approximations. Even though each unit vector does not have any correlation, all linear approximations can be obtained by spanning these unit vectors. The merit of this approach is that the evaluation of Boolean values of linear approximations is not needed; The probability distribution of the linear approximations can be obtained by just measuring the frequencies of the concatenated value of input and output of the linear characteristic. Hence, the time complexity of the attack can be reduced by at least a factor of  <span class="math">m</span>  where  <span class="math">m</span>  is the dimension of the linear approximations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Without increasing the amount of data complexity, we can recover another 32 bits of the round key by changing the input S-boxes of  <span class="math">U</span>  and the output S-boxes of  <span class="math">V</span>  over the  <span class="math">U \\circ \\Omega^{(n)} \\circ V</span> ; if the attack uses the linear characteristic starting with  <span class="math">S_7, S_{11}, S_{15}</span>  and ending with  <span class="math">S_{13}, S_{14}, S_{15}</span> , we recover the  <span class="math">K_1^{[48..63]}</span>  and the  <span class="math">K_n^{[12..15]}, K_n^{[28..31]}, K_n^{[44..47]}, K_n^{[60..63]}</span> . In this manner, we can recover  <span class="math">32 \\cdot 2</span>  bits of the round keys in the first and the last round key in total. The remaining  <span class="math">80 - 64 = 16</span>  bits of key can be obtained by exhaustive key search. Hence, the time complexity of the attack is around  <span class="math">2 \\cdot 2^{64} + 2^{16} \\approx 2^{65}</span>  in total.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Attack on 26-round PRESENT Our attack can be extended to 26-round version of PRESENT with the 24-round characteristic holding with the capacity of  <span class="math">2^{-55.38}</span> . If the attack uses the full range of text pairs, which is  <span class="math">2^{64}</span> , the theoretical advantage of attack is expected to be 8 by (2).

Hence, we apply the following attack scenario to the 26-round PRESENT: First, the multidimensional linear attack targeting 32 bits of the round key is performed with  <span class="math">2^{64}</span>  text pairs. As a result, the  <span class="math">2^{24}</span>  candidate keys are obtained. Second, the remained secret key bits  <span class="math">(80 - 32 = 48)</span>  are combined with the  <span class="math">2^{24}</span>  candidate keys from the top in order and the key exhaustive search is performed.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">From this scenario, the secret key can be found within the time complexity of  <span class="math">2^{64} + 2^{48} \\cdot 2^{24} \\approx 2^{72}</span> . Note that the theoretical estimation is always the lower bound since we use the correlations of only single linear trails. We compare our attacks with previous attacks against various rounds versions of PRESENT in Table 2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 2. Comparison of data and time complexity of the attacks against PRESENT (CP: Chosen Plaintext, KP: Known Plaintext)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Weakness of bit permutation Our attack is mainly based on the observation that PRESENT has a large number of linear approximations with the same magnitude of correlations. It seems that this weakness is caused by the lack of diffusion property of the bit permutation. Even though the bit permutation is desirable for efficient hardware implementation, it has a potential weakness that input bits and output bits have one-to-one correspondence. Hence, a single-bit linear approximations of an S-box of any round can be connected to another single-bit linear approximation of next round through the permutation layer. Since the S-box of PRESENT has multiple linear approximations of which linear</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">masks have a single active bit, one can construct multiple single-bit linear trails over arbitrary rounds. Note that this weakness does not appear in the linear transformation functions of Serpent <em>[2]</em> or AES <em>[6]</em> since any single output bit of the linear transformation is expressed as a boolean function of at least two input bits.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A simple remedy to prevent our attack is to revise the S-box in such a way that a single-bit linear approximations of S-box do not have significant correlations. However, we did not investigate how this remedy affects the other aspects of the security of PRESENT.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-17" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">4.2.2 Correlation and Piling Up Lemma</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The designers of PRESENT proved in Theorem 2 of <em>[3]</em> that the maximum correlation of a linear approximation of four rounds of PRESENT is <span class="math">2^{-6}</span>. As a result, the maximal correlation of a 28-round linear approximation was estimated to be <span class="math">(2^{-6})^{7}=2^{-42}</span> by Piling Up lemma <em>[3]</em>. Thus, the linear attack using the 28-round linear approximation would require more than <span class="math">2^{84}</span> data <em>[3]</em>. On the other hand, according to our analysis, the capacity of the 28 round PRESENT is estimated to be around <span class="math">2^{-65.8}</span> by the correlation theorem <em>[12]</em> so that 30 round of PRESENT can be (theoretically) attacked by around <span class="math">2^{75}</span> data.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The difference between the designers’ estimation and our result is originated from the fact that the designers considered a single linear approximation using a single linear trail holding with the strongest correlation, whereas our attack takes into account multiple linear approximations, each of which has multiple linear trails holding with strong correlations. Due to the existence of large amount of linear trails in PRESENT, the data complexity of the attack is reduced significantly compared to the estimate by a correlation of a single linear approximation.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-18" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">4.2.3 The <span class="math">\\chi^{2}</span> and LLR method</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, we justify the reason why the LLR method is not used for the attack on PRESENT even if the LLR method showed a better performance than the <span class="math">\\chi^{2}</span> method in the attacks on SERPENT <em>[7]</em>. As described in <em>[7]</em>, the LLR method is more advantageous compared to the <span class="math">\\chi^{2}</span> method if the pre-computed profile of the probability distribution is accurate. However, the distribution of linear approximations in PRESENT heavily depends on the key values so that the space for the profile of the probability distribution becomes too large. On the other hand, the <span class="math">\\chi^{2}</span> method does not need to know the distribution accurately; We only need to detect a large deviation of the probability distribution from the uniform distribution. It is an open problem whether there is a way to apply the LLR method efficiently for the attacks against PRESENT.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-19" class="text-2xl font-bold">5 Experiments</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We performed the multidimensional linear attacks on the reduced-round PRESENT by experiments in order to verify our theoretical analysis. We chose <span class="math">r=6,7,8,9</span> rounds version of PRESENT and applied our attack algorithm. We targeted to recover the 16 bits of the last round key by using <span class="math">(r-1)</span>-round linear characteristics. The plaintexts were randomly generated and encrypted by <span class="math">r</span>-round PRESENT. The experiments were repeated with the randomly chosen 200 secret keys and the average values of advantage were calculated. Figure 4 illustrates the relationship between the advantage of the attacks and the required amount of plaintexts for each experiments. The dashed lines represent theoretically estimations drawn by (2) and the solid lines are empirical results. We can see that the estimation of the full advantage of the attack is well matched with empirical results up to 9 rounds PRESENT. Due to the restriction of computational resources, we could not perform the</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">J. Y. Cho</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">attack algorithm which recovers 32 bits of the round key of the  <span class="math">r</span> -round version by the  <span class="math">(r - 2)</span> -round characteristic. However, based on our experimental results, we can conclude that our estimates of attack complexity against further rounds PRESENT are reasonable.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Modern block ciphers often prove the resistance of linear cryptanalysis by counting the minimum number of the active S-boxes involved in the best linear approximation. Even though PRESENT provides a provable security against linear cryptanalysis according to this rule, our attack shows that the resistance of the classical linear cryptanalysis does not always thwart the multidimensional linear attacks. Even though a simple, iterative structure of the cipher is desirable for the hardware-oriented block ciphers, such ciphers may have possibility to retain a large number of linear approximations by which a multidimensional linear attack can be applied efficiently. It is interesting to see that our attack can be applied to some other ciphers that have simple structures, like AES.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">ABSTRACT. We propose new squaring formulae for cyclotomic subgroups of certain finite fields. Our formulae use a compressed representation of elements having the property that decompression can be performed at a very low cost. The squaring formulae lead to new exponentiation algorithms in cyclotomic subgroups which outperform the fastest previously-known exponentiation algorithms when the exponent has low Hamming weight. Our algorithms can be adapted to accelerate the final exponentiation step of pairing computations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One challenge in cryptography is to achieve a desired level of security in the most efficient way. The efficiency can generally be improved if one can implement a cryptosystem with more compact parameters. An example in the context of discrete logarithm cryptosystems is the performance of 256-bit elliptic curve groups defined over 256-bit finite fields versus 256-bit subgroups of 3072-bit finite field groups. Even though both systems are believed to provide 128-bit security with a careful choice of parameters, the former leads to a more efficient implementation than the latter mainly because the points in the corresponding elliptic curve group are represented with fewer bits than the elements in the subgroup of the corresponding finite field group.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In recent years, there have been several proposals to represent the elements of cyclotomic subgroups of finite field groups with fewer bits than is required in their natural representation and to compute with the compressed representation of elements [26, 9, 5, 18, 8, 22, 30, 29, 25, 15, 16, 27, 14]. These methods help close the gap between the efficiency of elliptic curve cryptosystems and finite field based cryptosystems. A related research objective is to improve the efficiency of finite field arithmetic using the special structure of cyclotomic subgroups. The most recent work is by Granger and Scott [12] who improved and extended the results in [10] and [28]. They showed that if <span class="math">q\\equiv 1\\pmod{6}</span> then the squaring operation in the order-<span class="math">(q^{2}-q+1)</span> cyclotomic subgroup of <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{6}}^{*}</span> can be performed at a cost of only 6 multiplications in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span> (or 3 squarings in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2}}</span>).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We should emphasize that there are squaring algorithms that work with compressed representations of elements and that are faster than the method proposed in [12] for the order-<span class="math">(q^{2}-q+1)</span> cyclotomic subgroup <span class="math">G</span> of <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{6}}^{*}</span>. For example, if <span class="math">g\\in G</span> then one can adapt the XTR technique [18] to compute <span class="math">\\mathrm{Tr}_{\\mathbb{F}_{q^{6}}/\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2}}}(g^{2})</span> from <span class="math">\\mathrm{Tr}_{\\mathbb{F}_{q^{6}}/\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2}}}(g)</span> at a cost dominated by 2 multiplications in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span>. However, since the trace function is not multiplicative, many cyptographic protocols that require multiplying more than two elements in <span class="math">G</span> do not seem to benefit from this fast trace-based squaring method. In particular, given only the traces of elements, the cost of recovering the full representation of these elements (decompression) and also the cost of multiplication with the trace representation greatly dominate the cost of multiplying two elements given in their natural representations in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{6}}</span>. In addition, even though the trace-based methods yield single-exponentiation and double-exponentiation algorithms that are faster than their conventional counterparts, it is not known how to use trace-based methods in general multi-exponentiation</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">algorithms. Therefore, it is natural to look for squaring formulae that work with compressed representations and can be effectively incorporated into cryptographic applications.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Section 2 we classify the known squaring techniques for cyclotomic subgroups in two categories: those that work with natural representation of elements, and those that work with compressed representation of elements. We will focus on the order <span class="math">(q^{2}-q+1)</span>-cyclotomic subgroup <span class="math">G</span> of <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{6}}^{<em>}</span> as this seems to be the most interesting case with respect to some potential applications in pairing-based cryptography. In Section 3, we present a new formula for squaring elements in <span class="math">G</span> when <span class="math">q\\equiv 1\\pmod{6}</span>. We first describe a function <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}</span> that compresses elements <span class="math">g\\in G</span> by a factor of <span class="math">3/2</span>, and describe a decompression function <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}</span> that can be computed very efficiently and satisfies <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}(\\mathcal{C}(g))=g</span> for all <span class="math">g\\in G</span>. Our new squaring method works with this compressed form of elements. Given <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}(g)</span>, the cost of computing <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}(g^{2})</span> is dominated by 4 multiplications in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span> (or 2 squarings in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2}}</span>). Note that this is 33% faster than the method described in </em>[12]<em>. The efficient decompression will permit us to effectively utilize the squaring formula in exponentiation algorithms, especially when the exponent has low Hamming weight. In Section 4, we discuss some applications of our squaring formula and provide some comparisons based on operation counts. In Section 5, we describe a more general technique to search for efficient squaring formulae. As a result, we discover other squaring formulae some of which seem to offer better performance in particular cases. Section 5 also shows that some of the previously-known squaring formulae can be obtained via our search method. In Section 6, we compare our new squaring formulae and the squaring formulae in </em>[12]*. We conclude in Section 7.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">2.1.2.

Elements  <span class="math">g = g_{0} + g_{1}\\sigma \\in G_{\\Phi_{6}(p)}\\setminus \\{\\pm 1\\}</span>  can be uniquely represented by  <span class="math">\\alpha = (g_0 + 1) / g_1\\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^3}</span> . In fact, if  <span class="math">\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^3}</span>  is the compact representation of  <span class="math">g\\in G_{\\Phi_6(p)}</span>  then  <span class="math">g = (\\alpha +\\sigma) / (\\alpha -\\sigma)</span>  and  <span class="math">g^{2} = (\\alpha^{2} + c + 2\\alpha \\sigma) / (\\alpha^{2} + c - 2\\alpha c)</span> ; see [23]. Now, given  <span class="math">g^{2^{\\prime}} = (x + y\\sigma) / (x - y\\sigma)\\in G_{\\Phi_{6}(p)}</span>  for some  <span class="math">x,y\\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^3}</span> , one can write  <span class="math">g^{2^{\\prime +1}} = (x^{2} + y^{2}c + 2xy\\sigma) / (x^{2} + y^{2}c - 2xy\\sigma)</span> . In order to avoid the inversion operation in the squaring formula, one can encode an element  <span class="math">g = (x + y\\sigma) / (x - y\\sigma)\\in G_{\\Phi_6(p)}\\setminus \\{\\pm 1\\}</span>  with  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}(g) = [x,y]</span>  and compute  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}(g^2) = [x^2 +y^2 c,2xy]</span> , the (unique) representative of  <span class="math">g^2</span> . This is so-called squaring with mixed/projective coordinates; see, for example, [11]. We call this the TB2-squaring method as it uses factor-2 torus-based compression.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">TB2-squaring:  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}(g^2) = [x^2 + y^2c, 2xy]</span> , where  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}(g) = [x,y]</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 2.1. Given  <span class="math">g = (\\alpha + \\sigma) / (\\alpha - \\sigma) \\in G_{\\Phi_6(p)}</span>  for some  <span class="math">\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^3}</span> , one can exploit the algebraic structure of  <span class="math">G_{\\Phi_6(p)}</span>  to further compress  <span class="math">\\alpha</span>  to two  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> -elements [22, 11]. One can then define TB3-squaring analogous to TB2-squaring. However, to the author's knowledge, this extra structure has not yet been exploited to derive efficient TB3-squaring formulae. For example, it was reported in [11] that the cost of a TB3-squaring that uses the factor-3 torus-based compressed representation of elements in  <span class="math">G_{\\Phi_6(p)}</span>  is 21 multiplications, 38 additions and 1 inversion in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  (when  <span class="math">p \\equiv 2,5</span>  (mod 9)). Even though the inversion can be eliminated by using mixed/projective coordinates as in TB2-squaring, the cost is still dominated by 21 multiplications in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> , which is more expensive than the above TB2-squaring.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">2.2. Full representations. The squaring formulae that work with the natural representation of  <span class="math">g</span>  can be summarized as below.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Even though XTR-squaring seems to be the fastest squaring algorithm for  <span class="math">G_{\\Phi_{6i}(p)} \\subset \\mathbb{F}_{p^{6i}}^<em></span>  (or,  <span class="math">G_{\\Phi_6(q)} \\subset \\mathbb{F}_{q^6}^</em></span>  with  <span class="math">q = p^i</span> ) for  <span class="math">i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}</span> , it suffers from the non-multiplicative property of the trace function as mentioned in Section 1. Consequently, GS-squaring and SL1-squaring seem to be the best squaring algorithms that can be easily deployed in cryptographic algorithms. In addition, GS-squaring has the extra advantage that it allows the use of pairing-friendly or towering-friendly fields for more efficient implementation of pairing-based cryptographic protocols; see [17, 3].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In general, a pairing computation on <span class="math">E</span> is performed in two steps: Miller loop and final exponentiation. Scott <em>[24]</em> showed that the final exponentiation in the pairing computation can be done in two parts. In the first part, an element in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}^{<em>}</span> is raised to the power <span class="math">(p^{6}-1)(p^{2}+1)</span>.

In the second part of the final exponentiation, the so-called <em>hard part</em>, <span class="math">g</span> is raised to the power</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To be more concrete, one can choose <span class="math">u=-(2^{62}+2^{55}+1)</span> to obtain a BN-curve <span class="math">E</span> defined over a 254-bit prime <span class="math">p</span> with 254-bit prime order group <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_{p})</span> <em>[21]</em>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">GS-exponentiation seems to be the fastest of the previously-known methods to compute the hard part of the final exponentiation in the pairing computation.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Now, we describe an exponentiation algorithm similar to the one in Section 4.1 but avoiding the storage requirements.

According to <em>[4, Section 4.2 and Table 3]</em>, computing <span class="math">g^{u},g^{u^{2}}</span> and <span class="math">g^{u^{3}}</span> take 79% of the time of the final exponentiation, and the final exponentiation takes 42% of the time of the whole pairing computation. Hence, with our new exponentiation algorithm, we would expect a 17% speed-up for the final exponentiation, and a 7% speed-up for the pairing computation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Recently, Aranha et al. proposed and implemented a variant of the squaring algorithm in Theorem 3.2 for the pairing computation over a BN curve parametrized by <span class="math">u=-(2^{62}+2^{55}+1)</span> <em>[1]</em>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">We use the same notation as in Section 3. In particular, let</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As we noted in Section 4, the decompression costs must be considered when adapting our squaring formulae in exponentiation algorithms. However, this does not seem to be a big issue when the exponent has low Hamming weight. For example, in Section 4.1 we discuss how  <span class="math">\\mathrm{SQR}_{2345}</span>  can be used to improve the efficiency of exponentiation in  <span class="math">G_{\\Phi_{12}(p)} \\subset \\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}^<em></span>  and the BN pairing computations. Similarly, from Table 4 we see that  <span class="math">\\mathrm{SQR}_{2345}</span>  can be used to improve the efficiency of exponentiation in  <span class="math">G_{\\Phi_k(p)} \\subset \\mathbb{F}_{p^k}^</em></span>  and pairing computations that use elliptic curves with embedding degree  <span class="math">k</span> , for  <span class="math">k = 18, 24</span> .</p>

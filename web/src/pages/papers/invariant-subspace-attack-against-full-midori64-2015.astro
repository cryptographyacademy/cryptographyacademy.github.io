      <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper, we present an invariant subspace attack against block cipher Midori64 which has recently been proposed by Banik et al. at Asiacrypt 2015 to achieve low energy consumption. We show that when each nibble of the key has the value 0 or 1 and each nibble of the plaintext has the value 8 or 9, each nibble of the ciphertext also has the value 8 or 9 with probability one regardless of the number of rounds applied. This fact indicates that Midori64 has a class of $2^{32}$ weak keys that can be distinguished with a single query. It also indicates that the number of keys generated uniformly at random for Midori64 must not exceed $2^{96}$, i.e., the pseudorandom-permutation security of Midori64 is only up to 96 bits instead of 128 bits. Interestingly, given the information that the key is from the $2^{32}$ weak key subspace, key recovery can be performed within time complexity $2^{16}$ and data complexity $2^1$. We have confirmed the correctness of the analysis by implementing the attack. At the current stage, our attacks do not apply to Midori128.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">1 Introduction</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Midori is a family of lightweight block ciphers recently published at Asiacrypt 2015 <a href="#page-9-0">[1]</a>. They have been advertised as one of the first lightweight ciphers optimized with respect to the energy consumed by the circuit per bit in encryption or decryption operation. To achieve the desired low energy goal, several design decisions were made in Midori. The diffusion layer consists of almost MDS 4 &times; 4 binary matrices. The 4-bit S-box has a small delay, i.e. 1.5-2 times faster than those of PRINCE <a href="#page-11-0">[3]</a> and PRESENT <a href="#page-10-0">[2]</a>. The round constants are seemingly random binary values extracted for the constant &pi;. The key schedule is trivial and thus efficient. Finally, the number of rounds is rather small for lightweight ciphers: only 16-20 rounds are used.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The submission document of Midori contains a standard analysis of the ciphers against various types of attacks: differential and linear, boomerangs, impossible differentials, etc. As a result, it has been concluded that the ciphers provide a safe security margin. Additional analysis of Midori has been provided in [7]. In that work, Lin and Wu show that 12 rounds (out of 16) of Midori64 can be attacked with the meet-in-the-middle technique, with a rather high complexity: the key recovery requires around  <span class="math">2^{55}</span>  chosen plaintexts,  <span class="math">2^{106}</span>  memory, and  <span class="math">2^{125.5}</span>  computations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our Contribution. We show that Midori64 has a class of  <span class="math">2^{32}</span>  weak keys that can be distinguished with a complexity of a single query. Furthermore, within this class of keys, a key recovery can be achieved efficiently given two plaintext-ciphertext pairs, including one that should verify the distinguisher.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our analysis is based on the invariant subspace attacks [5] and uses the unfortunate combination in Midori64 of round constants, fixed points for the S-box, and multiplication by binary matrix in the diffusion layer. When each nibble of the master key has the value 0 or 1 (in total  <span class="math">2^{32}</span>  such keys), and each nibble of the state (including the plaintext) has the value of 8 or 9, then the transformations in Midori64 keep the state in the same class (of nibbles values 8 and 9). Hence, regardless of the number of rounds, the class is maintained, and as a result, the ciphertext belongs to this class as well. This fact allows to launch an efficient distinguisher. The key recovery uses an additional fact: the values 8 and 9 are fixed points for the S-box used in Midori64. As a result, the whole cipher under the weak-key class becomes a linear transformation (the only non-linear component, the S-box, turns into the identity mapping). Therefore, recovering the key is equivalent to solving a system of linear equations and can be achieved given only two pairs of plaintext-ciphertext verifying the distinguisher.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We have confirmed the correctness of the whole analysis by implementing independently the distinguisher and the key recovery. At the current stage, our attacks do not apply to Midori128.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">2 Preliminaries</h2>

      <h3 id="sec-2.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2.1 Description of Midori</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Midori consists of two algorithms Midori64 and Midori128. The block size, n, is 64 bits and 128 bits for Midori64 and Midori128, respectively, and the key size is 128 bits for both. Both of Midori64 and Midori128 adopt a standard SPN structure, and the internal state is represented as  <span class="math">4 \\times 4</span>  cells, where the size of each cell is 4 bits for Midori64 and 8 bits for Midori128. The state S consisting of sixteen cells  <span class="math">s_0, s_1, \\ldots, s_{15}</span>  has the following data structure:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$S = \\begin{bmatrix} s_0 &amp; s_4 &amp; s_8 &amp; s_{12} \\\\ s_1 &amp; s_5 &amp; s_9 &amp; s_{13} \\\\ s_2 &amp; s_6 &amp; s_{10} &amp; s_{14} \\\\ s_3 &amp; s_7 &amp; s_{11} &amp; s_{15} \\end{bmatrix}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In high-level, by using a 128-bit key, Midori64 and Midori128 generate a whitening key WK and r-1 round keys  <span class="math">RK_0, RK_1, \\ldots, RK_{r-2}</span> . Here, r is the</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">number of rounds, which is 16 for Midori64 and 20 for Midori128. The plaintext is first loaded into the state and the whitening key WK is XORed to the state. Then, the round function  <span class="math">RF: \\{0,1\\}^n \\times \\{0,1\\}^{128} \\mapsto \\{0,1\\}^n</span> , which takes as input the current state and the round key  <span class="math">RK_i</span>  and outputs the updated state, is iterated r-2 times. Finally, the last round function  <span class="math">RF^l</span>  is applied and the resulting state is output as the ciphertext.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Key Generation.</strong> In Midori64, the 128-bit key K is separated into two 64-bit states  <span class="math">K_0</span>  and  <span class="math">K_1</span> . Then, the whitening key WK is computed by  <span class="math">K_0 \\oplus K_1</span> , and the round key  <span class="math">RK_i</span>  for  <span class="math">i=0,1,\\ldots 14</span>  is computed by  <span class="math">K_{(i \\mod 2)} \\oplus \\alpha_i</span> , where  <span class="math">\\alpha_i</span>  is a round constant described below. In Midori128, WK is simply K and  <span class="math">RK_i</span>  for  <span class="math">i=0,1,\\ldots 18</span>  is  <span class="math">K_i \\oplus \\alpha_i</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Round constant  <span class="math">\\alpha_i</span>  where  <span class="math">i=0,1,\\ldots,18</span>  is the only component which differs in different rounds:  <span class="math">\\alpha_i</span>  consists of 16 binary cells. The constants have been derived from the hexadecimal encoding of the fractional part of  <span class="math">\\pi</span> . For example,  <span class="math">\\alpha_0</span>  to  <span class="math">\\alpha_3</span>  are defined as follows.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\alpha_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\alpha_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\alpha_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\alpha_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The other  <span class="math">\\alpha_i</span> 's are similarly defined. Refer to [1] for more details. In this paper, we later exploit the fact that all the cells in any  <span class="math">\\alpha_i</span>  are 0 or 1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Round Function and the Last Round Function. The round function RF consists of the four operations SubCell, ShuffleCell, MixColumn and KeyAdd that update the n-bit state S.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>SubCell.</strong> This operation in Midori64 applies a 4-bit S-box  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Sb}_0</span>  to each cell and its equivalent in Midori128 applies four 8-bit S-boxes  <span class="math">\\mathsf{SSb}_0</span> ,  <span class="math">\\mathsf{SSb}_1</span> ,  <span class="math">\\mathsf{SSb}_2</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathsf{SSb}_3</span>  to each of four cells in Row 0, Row 1, Row 2 and Row 3, respectively. Each  <span class="math">\\mathsf{SSb}_i</span>  is generated by 4-bit S-box  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Sb}_1</span> . Refer to [1] for the details of how to generate  <span class="math">\\mathsf{SSb}_i</span>  from  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Sb}_1</span> . The full specifications of  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Sb}_0</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Sb}_1</span>  are shown in Table 1.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-2.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2.2 The Invariant Subspace Attack</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As a method of cryptanalysis, the invariant subspace attack has been introduced by Leander et al. at CRYPTO 2011 <a href="#page-12-1">[5]</a>. In this method, the adversary aims to find so-called invariant subspaces, i.e. subsets of the set of all possible state and key values, invariant of the round transformations used in the analyzed cipher. When such a subset exists, then the adversary encrypts plaintexts that belong to the subset, assumes the master key belongs as well to the subset (thus it is a weak-key attack) and expects to obtain corresponding ciphertexts that also belong to the subset. This immediately yields a distinguisher for the cipher, while more advanced approaches can be used for a key recovery.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Non-trivial invariant subspaces not necessarily exist for a given cipher. When they do exist, they are found either by a careful analysis (as it is the case of the analysis of PRINTCipher <a href="#page-12-1">[5]</a>) or with the use of a specialized tool <a href="#page-12-2">[6]</a>. To deduce the invariant subspace, the former method requires examination of all the transformations used in the cipher, which usually provide a hint of the possible subspace. On the other hand, the latter method is generic and is achieved by a computer search. Its success depends on the proportion of the sizes of weak to all key class.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This section explains our subspace attack on Midori64. Our attack is a weak-key attack, in which the size of the weak-key class is 2<sup>32</sup>. With such a weak key, Midori64 can be distinguished from a random permutation only with one chosen plaintext query, negligible computational cost, and negligible memory amount. Moreover, the key can be recovered from the 2<sup>32</sup> choices with approximately 2<sup>16</sup> operations.</p>

Therefore, for any  <span class="math">X, Y \\in \\mathbb{K}</span> ,  <span class="math">X \\oplus Y \\in \\mathbb{K}</span> . This fact enables us to simulate all round keys.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The whitening key WK is computed by  <span class="math">K_0 \\oplus K_1</span> . By assuming  <span class="math">K_0, K_1 \\in \\mathbb{K}</span> , we have  <span class="math">WK \\in \\mathbb{K}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The round key for the <em>i</em>-th round,  <span class="math">RK_i</span> , is computed by  <span class="math">K_{(i \\mod 2)} \\oplus \\alpha_i</span> . Here, an important observation for our attack is that all the round constants  <span class="math">\\alpha_i</span>  only consist of 0 and 1, i.e.,  <span class="math">\\alpha_i \\in \\mathbb{K}</span>  for  <span class="math">i = 0, 1, \\ldots, 14</span> . By assuming  <span class="math">K_0, K_1 \\in \\mathbb{K}</span> , we have  <span class="math">RK_i \\in \\mathbb{K}</span>  for all  <span class="math">i = 0, 1, \\ldots, 14</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Data Processing Part.</strong> Let  <span class="math">x \\in \\mathcal{S}</span>  and  <span class="math">y \\in \\mathcal{K}</span> . Then,  <span class="math">x \\oplus y \\in \\mathcal{S}</span> . Therefore, for any  <span class="math">X \\in \\mathbb{S}</span>  and  <span class="math">Y \\in \\mathbb{K}</span> ,  <span class="math">X \\oplus Y \\in \\mathbb{S}</span> . As long as the plaintext  <span class="math">P \\in \\mathbb{S}</span> , the state after adding the whitening key,  <span class="math">WK \\in \\mathbb{K}</span> , belongs to  <span class="math">\\mathbb{S}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Then, the state is processed by the SubCell operation. Here, we exploit two particular data transitions through the S-box for Midori64;  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Sb}_0(8) = 8</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Sb}_0(9) = 9</span> . Namely, as long as the input state belongs to  <span class="math">\\mathbb{S}</span> , SubCell is equivalent to the identity map. Obviously, we obtain  <span class="math">\\mathbb{S} \\leftarrow \\mathsf{SubCell}(\\mathbb{S})</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The subsequent ShuffleCell is a nibble-wise permutation, and since all nibbles in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{S}</span>  satisfy  <span class="math">\\mathcal{S}</span> ,  <span class="math">\\mathbb{S} \\leftarrow \\mathsf{ShuffleCell}(\\mathbb{S})</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The MixColumn operation is slightly more complex. Because the diffusion matrix is a binary matrix, each output nibble from MixColumn can be represented as the XOR of three input nibbles. As long as the input state belongs to  <span class="math">\\mathbb{S}</span> , each of three nibbles is either 8 or 9. Thus, the possibilities for each output nibble is the following eight cases:</p>

    <pre><code class="language-text">8 \\oplus 8 \\oplus 8 = 8, 8 \\oplus 8 \\oplus 9 = 9, 8 \\oplus 9 \\oplus 8 = 9, 8 \\oplus 9 \\oplus 9 = 8, 9 \\oplus 8 \\oplus 8 = 9, 9 \\oplus 8 \\oplus 9 = 8, 9 \\oplus 9 \\oplus 8 = 8, 9 \\oplus 9 \\oplus 9 = 9.
</code></pre>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In any case, each output nibble belongs to S, thus  <span class="math">S \\leftarrow \\mathsf{MixColumn}(S)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The KeyAdd operation is the same as the whitening key addition, i.e.,  <span class="math">\\mathbb{S} \\leftarrow \\mathsf{KeyAdd}(\\mathbb{S}, RK_i \\in \\mathbb{K})</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Summary.</strong> Thanks to the property of  <span class="math">\\alpha_i \\in \\mathbb{K}</span> , any weak key  <span class="math">K_0, K_1 \\in \\mathbb{K}</span>  leads to  <span class="math">WK \\in \\mathbb{K}</span>  and  <span class="math">RK_i \\in \\mathbb{K}</span> . Let  <span class="math">P \\in \\mathbb{S}</span> . Then, the state after the whitening key addition becomes  <span class="math">\\mathbb{S} \\leftarrow \\mathsf{KeyAdd}(P \\in \\mathbb{S}, WK \\in \\mathbb{K})</span> . Then, the following round function is iterated by incrementing the round number i.</p>

    <pre><code class="language-text">\\begin{split} \\mathbb{S} &amp;\\leftarrow \\mathsf{SubCell}(\\mathbb{S}), \\\\ \\mathbb{S} &amp;\\leftarrow \\mathsf{ShuffleCell}(\\mathbb{S}), \\\\ \\mathbb{S} &amp;\\leftarrow \\mathsf{MixColumn}(\\mathbb{S}), \\\\ \\mathbb{S} &amp;\\leftarrow \\mathsf{KeyAdd}(\\mathbb{S}, RK_i \\in \\mathbb{K}). \\end{split}
</code></pre>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As a result, regardless of the number of rounds applied, the state belongs to  <span class="math">\\mathbb{S}</span>  with probability one. The last round only consists of SubCell and the whitening key addition, which does not break the property. This completes the proof of Theorem 1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Impact.</strong> The subspace attack is a weak-key attack. Since 16 nibbles in  <span class="math">K_0</span>  and 16 nibbles in  <span class="math">K_1</span>  can be either 0 or 1, the class contains  <span class="math">2^{32}</span>  different weak keys. In other words, the number of keys generated uniformly at random for Midori64 must not exceed  <span class="math">2^{96}</span> . Otherwise, the pseudorandom-permutation (PRP) security will be spoiled.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In provable security, the PRP security of the encryption algorithm  <span class="math">E_K</span>  is usually measured by the advantage of the adversary who tries to distinguish a random instantiation of  <span class="math">E_K</span>  from a random permutation RP. Let  <span class="math">\\Pi = (\\kappa, E_K)</span>  denote an encryption scheme, where  <span class="math">\\kappa</span>  is a key space and  <span class="math">E_K</span>  is an encryption algorithm. We define $ be a set of all bijective mappings on the block length. Then, the advantage of the distinguisher  <span class="math">D^{\\mathcal{O}}</span>  with access to the oracle  <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}</span>  who tries to break the PRP security of  <span class="math">\\Pi</span>  can be defined as follows</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathbf{Adv}_{II}^{\\mathrm{PRP}}(D) = \\Big| \\mathrm{Pr} \\big[ K \\overset{\\</span>}{\\leftarrow} \\kappa : D^{E_K} = 1 \\big] - \\mathrm{Pr} \\big[ RP \\overset{$}{\\leftarrow} $ : D^{RP} = 1 \\big] \\Big|,$$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">\\stackrel{\\</span>}{\\leftarrow}$  represents to choose one of the elements in the set uniformly at random. The crucial point here is that the key for the particular encryption algorithm  <span class="math">E_K</span>  is chosen uniformly at random, and the adversary's goal is increasing the probability for win rather than distinguishing the target with probability one. Therefore, even though our subspace attack is a weak-key attack by cryptanalyst's words, it gives a certain impact from a provable-security viewpoint, i.e., the PRP security of Midori64 is up to 96 bits instead of 128 bits.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Experiment.</strong> We implemented our subspace attack and verified its correctness. Some examples are shown in Table 2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Computer Search of Invariant Subspaces. We found the above invariant subspace by hand. In an attempt to increase the size of the weak-key class or to find other similar subspaces, we performed additionally a computer search. We brute-forced all possible subspaces of values of nibbles in the plaintext (each nibble belongs to the same subset) and all possible values of master key nibbles (similarly, they all belong to another subset). As there are 16 values for the nibbles in each of the two cases, the brute-force required around  <span class="math">2^{16} \\cdot 2^{16} = 2^{32}</span>  time. We found five subspaces, all subsets of the original subspace. Thus, we can conclude that no larger weak-key classes of the analyzed type exist in Midori64.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-3.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.2 Key Recovery with Invariant Subspace Attack</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we describe how a chosen plaintext P and its corresponding ciphertext C satisfying the subspace distinguisher can be used to efficiently recover the 128-bit weak key. Because the size of the weak-key class is  <span class="math">2^{32}</span> , the exhaustive search on the entire weak keys requires only  <span class="math">2^{32}</span>  computations. Hence, our goal is identifying the key with complexity less than  <span class="math">2^{32}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The main observation pertains to the behavior of the S-box on the subset  <span class="math">\\mathcal{S}</span> . Indeed, the S-box  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Sb}_0</span>  used in Midori64 has four fixed points  <span class="math">\\mathcal{S} \\subset \\{3,7,8,9\\}</span> . Consequently, under the assumption that  <span class="math">S \\in \\mathbb{S}</span> , the S-box behaves like the identity map, which in turn makes the full Midori64 cipher linear.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Therefore, recovering the 128-bit key  <span class="math">K = K_0 || K_1</span>  can be done by writing the system of linear equations between  <span class="math">P \\in \\mathbb{S}</span>  and  <span class="math">C \\in \\mathbb{S}</span> . To describe the system, we denote by  <span class="math">k_0, \\ldots, k_{15}</span>  the 16 variables from  <span class="math">K_0</span> , and by  <span class="math">k_{16}, \\ldots, k_{31}</span>  the 16 ones from  <span class="math">K_1</span> . We emphasize that  <span class="math">k_i \\in \\mathcal{K}</span> , since we assume that K belongs the weak-key class  <span class="math">\\mathbb{K}</span> . Similarly, we denote the 16 known variables of the plaintext P by  <span class="math">p_0, \\ldots, p_{15}</span>  and the 16 known variables of the ciphertext C by  <span class="math">c_0, \\ldots, c_{15}</span> ,</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">4 Countermeasures</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we briefly discuss possible countermeasures against our invariant subspace attack without destroying the design policy of Midori64. Note that the invariant subspace attack can work regardless of the number of rounds applied.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Therefore, simply increasing the number of rounds is not sufficient (and not energy-consumption friendly): consequently, a part of the round function or the key generation should be modified.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The first direction is replacing the S-box Sb<sup>0</sup> with another one. The new S-box must be chosen carefully. For example, replacing Sb<sup>0</sup> with Sb<sup>1</sup> prevents the invariant subspace of Theorem <a href="#page-5-0">1,</a> while it allows another invariant subspace</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$P \\in \\mathbb{K} \\stackrel{K_0, K_1 \\in \\mathbb{K}}{\\mapsto} C \\in \\mathbb{K}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">due to the property of Sb1(0) = 1 and Sb1(1) = 0.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The second direction is replacing the round constant &alpha;<sup>i</sup> . A conservative way is using all of 0 to 15 in &alpha;<sup>i</sup> . Another approach is using different 4-bit values in different rounds, for example, replacing '1' in &alpha;<sup>i</sup> with round number counter i.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The third direction is applying bit-permutations during the round function. Fortunately, Midori has already introduced several bit-permutations to generate SSb<sup>i</sup> from Sb1. The same bit-permutations can be reused to break the invariant subspace property.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The last direction we would like to mention is replacing the key generation process, i.e., introducing a light key schedule. The TWEAKEY framework <a href="#page-12-3">[4]</a> seems to fit the design for low energy consumption. Moreover, practical related-key differential attacks on Midori can be prevented at the same time.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper, we have presented the invariant subspace attack against Midori64. We showed that Midori64 has a class of 2<sup>32</sup> weak keys, and with such keys along with a properly chosen plaintext, the cipher becomes a linear transformation thus can be distinguished with single chosen-plaintext query and even key recovery can be performed by simply solving a system of linear equations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">At the current stage, the attack cannot be applied to Midori128, and this inspires us several countermeasures for Midori64. Investigating the design achieving more secure but retaining almost the same implementation cost as Midori64 is an interesting future research direction.</p>

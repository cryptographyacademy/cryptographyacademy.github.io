    <p class="text-gray-300">Abstract. RECTANGLE is a newly proposed lightweight block cipher which allows fast implementations for multiple platforms by using bitslice techniques. It is an iterative 25-round SPN block cipher with a 64-bit block size and a 80-bit or 128-bit key size. Until now, the results on analyzing the cipher are not too much, which includes an attack on the 18-round reduced version proposed by the designers themselves. In this paper, we find all 15-round differential characteristics with 26–30 active S-boxes for given input, output and round subkey differences, which have a total probability 2&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;60.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; . Based on these differential characteristics, we extend the corresponding distinguisher to 2 rounds backward and forward respectively, and propose an attack on the 19-round reduced RECTANGLE-80 with data complexity of 2&lt;sup&gt;62&lt;/sup&gt; plaintexts, time complexity of about 2&lt;sup&gt;67&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt; encryptions and memory complexity of 2&lt;sup&gt;72&lt;/sup&gt;. TThese data and time complexities are much lower than that of the designers for the 18-round reduced RECTANGLE-80.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1 Introduction</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Lightweight block ciphers can be widely used in small embedded devices such as RFIDs and sensor networks. They are becoming more and more popular, and this can be seen from the phenomena that many lightweight algorithms were proposed in recent years, including PRESENT [6], LED [10], LBlock [23], PRINCE [7], Zorro [9], and two lightweight block ciphers designed by the U.S. National Security Agency, Simon and Speck [1]. Very recently, a new lightweight block cipher called RECTANGLE was proposed by Zhang et al. [24], which is an iterative 25-round SPN block cipher with a 64-bit block size and a 80-bit or 128-bit key size to allow fast implementations on multiple platforms by using bit-slice techniques.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Security is crucially important for a cipher, and a new cipher must be able to resist against all known attacks. Differential cryptanalysis [4] and linear cryptanalysis [15] are two of the most basic and effective attacks on block ciphers.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Data Assurance and Communication Security Research Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">There are many variants of differential analysis, such as related-key differential attack [2], truncated differential attack [11] and impossible differential attack [3], and essentially, all of these differential attacks study the differential behavior of the target cipher.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A differential characteristic with high probability can be used to construct a distinguisher or recover some secret keys. In general, for SPN block ciphers, the probability of a differential characteristic can be characterized by the number of active S-boxes in the corresponding differential characteristic. Therefore, counting the number of active S-boxes is a useful and interesting problem. On one hand, if the minimum number of active S-boxes is large, it proves that the cipher can resist against the differential attack. On the other hand, a differential characteristic with fewer active S-boxes can be used to construct a distinguisher.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The problem of counting active S-boxes of a word-oriented symmetric cipher was transformed to be a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem by Mouha et al. [16]. They proposed a series of inequalities or equalities over integers to describe some operations over finite fields with characteristic 2, such as XORs and linear transformations. Two word-oriented symmetric ciphers, AES and Enocoro-128v2, were then considered along this line, and they proved that Enocoro-128v2 is secure enough to resist against differential and linear cryptanalysis. Subsequently, Sun et al. proposed a method to obtain a series of inequalities over integers for describing an S-box and generalized Mouha et al.'s method to apply to bit-oriented symmetric ciphers [20, 21]. In [21], it was proved that the cipher PRESENT-80 is secure enough to resist against standard related-key differential attack and the lower bound of probabilities of related-key differential characteristics of the full-round LBlock is upper bounded by 2&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;56. Very recently, by using the method proposed by Mauha et al. and Sun et al., Qiao et al. proved that the cipher FOX is strong enough to resist against single-key differential attack [17] and Ma et al. showed that 18 and 39 rounds are sufficient for the block cipher MIBS to resist against the single-key and related-key differential attacks, respectively [14]. Besides, Sun et al. proposed a method for automatic enumeration of all (related-key) differential characteristics with given input or/and output differences [22].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Some results of security analysis on RECTANGLE have been proposed by the designers in their design document [24]. The designers completed described a 18-round differential attack by two 14-round differential characteristics with the same input and output differences. The time, data and memory complexities are 278.69, 2&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt; and 272, respectively. For other attacks, the designers pointed out that the amplitude of the correlation coefficients of the best linear characteristic is 2&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;37, and asserted that RECTANGLE has enough security against the statistical saturation attack [8], impossible differential cryptanalysis [3], integral cryptanalysis [13] and key schedule attacks [2, 5]. Recently, Selvam et al. reduce the key research space from 2&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt; to 288 by the differential power analysis [19].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our contribution. In this paper, we apply the methods proposed by Mouha et al. and Sun et al. to find out a 15-round related-key differential characteristic with 26 active S-boxes, whose input, output and round subkey differences are with low Hamming weight. For the obtained input, output and round subkey differences, we find out all 15-round differential characteristics with 26-30 active S-boxes by using the method proposed in [22]. The number of the differential characteristics is 1254 and the total probability is  <span class="math">2^{-60.5}</span> . Based on these differential characteristics, we extend the corresponding distinguisher to 2 rounds backward and forward respectively and propose an attack on the 19-round reduced RECTANGLE-80. The data complexity of our attack is  <span class="math">2^{62}</span>  plaintexts, the time complexity is about  <span class="math">2^{67.42}</span>  19-round encryptions and the memory complexity is  <span class="math">2^{72}</span> . Compared with the designers' differential analysis, we can attack one more round, and the data and time complexities are much better.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A difficult point in our attack is that there is a large number of active S-boxes in the extended 2 rounds backward and forward. By a general method, the number of the key counters is more than  <span class="math">2^{80}</span> , here the method we use is to guess a lot of bits in the 0th round subkey, and then more bits in the 1st, 18th and 19th round subkeys are determined according to the key schedule. Thereby, we can reduce the number of the key counters to  <span class="math">2^{72}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Organization of this paper.</strong> In Section 2, we briefly describe the RECT-ANGLE block cipher. In Section 3, we introduce the MILP based methods proposed by Mouha <em>et al.</em> and Sun <em>et al.</em> The related-key differential attack on the round reduced RECTANGLE is proposed in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes this study.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2 A Brief Description of RECTANGLE</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we briefly describe the block cipher RECTANGLE and refer the readers to [24] for more details.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">RECTANGLE is a lightweight block cipher with an SPN structure proposed by Zhang et al. [24] in 2014. It allows fast implementations on multiple platforms by using bit-slice techniques. Its block length is 64 bits, while two versions of the key length, 80 bits and 128 bits, are provided. In this paper, we only consider the version with 80-bit secret keys.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For convenience, we introduce a notation for a 4<em>l</em>-bit block throughout this paper. Let  <span class="math">B=(b_{4l-1},\\cdots,b_{3l},\\cdots,b_{l-1},b_0)</span>  be a 4<em>l</em>-bit block, it can be written as a  <span class="math">4\\times 16</span>  rectangle</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\begin{bmatrix} b_{l-1} &amp; b_{l-2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; b_2 &amp; b_1 &amp; b_0 \\\\ b_{2l-1} &amp; b_{2l-2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; b_{l+2} &amp; b_{l+1} &amp; b_l \\\\ b_{3l-1} &amp; b_{3l-2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; b_{2l+2} &amp; b_{2l+1} &amp; b_{2l} \\\\ b_{4l-1} &amp; b_{4l-2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; b_{3l+2} &amp; b_{3l+1} &amp; b_{3l} \\end{bmatrix}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">B^{(j)}</span>  denote the vector in the jth column of the rectangle, i.e.,  <span class="math">B^{(j)} = (b_j, b_{j+l}, b_{j+2l}, b_{j+3l})</span> , where  <span class="math">0 \\le j \\le l-1</span> . Let  <span class="math">B^{(i,j)}</span>  denote the entry in the ith row and jth column of the rectangle, i.e.,  <span class="math">B^{(i,j)} = b_{j+il}</span> . For example, a 64-bit plaintext, a 64-bit intermediate state, or a 64-bit ciphertext  <span class="math">(w_{63}, w_{62}, \\dots, w_0)</span> ,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The master key and the round subkeys  <span class="math">(k_{79}, k_{78}, \\dots, k_0)</span>  are viewed as  <span class="math">4 \\times 20</span>  rectangles below.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The cipher has 25 rounds of iterations. Each round consists of three steps: AddRoundkey, SubColumn and ShiftRow (Please see Figure 1). In the first step</p>

The round constants RC[i] ( <span class="math">0 \\le i \\le 24</span> ) are generated by a 5-bit LFSR with the initial state RC[0]=(0,0,0,0,1).

    <h3 id="sec-3" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3 Description of the Extended MILP</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we introduce the MILP based methods proposed by Mouha <em>et al.</em> and Sun <em>et al.</em> The mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem is an optimization problem derived from linear programming with some or all variables restricted over integers. It can be described as:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">MILP: Find a vector  <span class="math">x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^k \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n-k} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n</span>  with  <span class="math">Ax \\leq b</span> , such that the linear function  <span class="math">c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + \\cdots + c_nx_n</span>  is minimized (or maximized), where  <span class="math">(c_1, c_2, \\cdots, c_n) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n</span> ,  <span class="math">A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}</span>  and  <span class="math">b \\in \\mathbb{R}^m</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To count the minimum number of active S-boxes for some ciphers, Mouha et al. transformed it to an MILP problem [16]. To this end, some operations over finite fields with characteristic 2 are described by several linear constraints over integers. The following two operations were considered by Mouha et al.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(i) XOR operation  <span class="math">\\oplus</span> :  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2^w \\times \\mathbb{F}_2^w \\to \\mathbb{F}_2^w</span> . Assume that  <span class="math">a = (a_0, \\dots, a_{w-1})</span> ,  <span class="math">b = (b_0, \\dots, b_{w-1})</span>  and  <span class="math">c = (c_0, \\dots, c_{w-1})</span>  are the input and output differences of the XOR operation, i.e.,  <span class="math">a_i \\oplus b_i = c_i</span>  for all  <span class="math">0 \\le i \\le w-1</span> . Then the equality can be described by the following inequalities over integers:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">$$\\begin{cases}
a_i + b_i + c_i \\ge 2d_i, \\
d_i \\ge a_i, \\
d_i \\ge b_i, \\
d_i \\ge c_i,
\\end{cases}$$
(1)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">d_i \\in \\mathbb{F}_2</span>  is a dummy variable and  <span class="math">0 \\le i \\le w - 1</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that the description on the operation XOR above is not complete. For example, if  <span class="math">(a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i) = (1, 1, 1, 1)</span> , it is easily checked that  <span class="math">(a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i)</span>  satisfies inequalities (1), but not satisfies the operation XOR since  <span class="math">1 \\oplus 1 = 0</span> . An additional inequality over integers  <span class="math">a_i + b_i + c_i \\leq 2</span> , combining with inequalities (1), can equivalently describe the operation XOR.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(ii) Linear transformation  <span class="math">L: \\mathbb{F}_{2^w}^m \\to \\mathbb{F}_{2^w}^m</span> , where m is the word size. The branch number  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_L</span>  of L is defined as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathcal{B}_L = \\min_{x \\neq 0} \\{ \\operatorname{wt}(x) + \\operatorname{wt}(Lx) : x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{2^w}^m \\},</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where the Hamming weight  <span class="math">\\operatorname{wt}(x)</span>  is the number of the nonzero components of x. Let  <span class="math">\\Delta x = (\\Delta x_0, \\Delta x_1, \\dots, \\Delta x_{m-1})</span>  and  <span class="math">\\Delta y = (\\Delta y_0, \\Delta y_1, \\dots, \\Delta y_{m-1})</span>  be the</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">input and output differences of L, then ∆xL = ∆y. The linear constraints of L over integers are</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\begin{cases} \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (\\Delta x_i + \\Delta y_i) \\ge \\mathcal{B}_L d_L, \\\\ d_L \\ge \\Delta x_i, \\ 0 \\le i \\le m-1, \\\\ d_L \\ge \\Delta y_i, \\ 0 \\le i \\le m-1, \\end{cases}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where d&lt;sup&gt;L&lt;/sup&gt; ∈ F&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a dummy variable.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Subsequently, Sun et al. proposed two methods to obtain linear constraints of an S-box based on logical condition modelling and computational geometry [20, 21].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(iii) S-box S: F w &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → F w 2 . The input and output differences of S are denoted as ∆α = (∆α0, ∆α1, · · · , ∆αw−1) and ∆β = (∆β0, ∆β1, · · · , ∆βw−1), respectively. Let δ denote whether the S-box S is active or not, i.e.,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\delta = \\begin{cases} 0, (\\Delta \\alpha_0, \\Delta \\alpha_1, \\cdots, \\Delta \\alpha_{w-1}) = 0, \\\\ 1, \\text{ otherwise.} \\end{cases}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The equivalent description over integers between δ and ∆α is</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\begin{cases} \\delta - \\Delta \\alpha_i \\ge 0, \\ 0 \\le i \\le w - 1, \\\\ \\Delta \\alpha_0 + \\Delta \\alpha_1 + \\dots + \\Delta \\alpha_{w-1} - \\delta \\ge 0. \\end{cases}</span>$
(2)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Additionally, for an invertible S-box, since the input difference is nonzero if and only if the corresponding output difference is nonzero, the constraints described over integers are as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">$$\\begin{cases}
(\\Delta\\alpha_0 + \\Delta\\alpha_1 + \\dots + \\Delta\\alpha_{w-1})w - (\\Delta\\beta_0 + \\Delta\\beta_1 + \\dots + \\Delta\\beta_{w-1}) \\ge 0, \\
(\\Delta\\beta_0 + \\Delta\\beta_1 + \\dots + \\Delta\\beta_{w-1})w - (\\Delta\\alpha_0 + \\Delta\\alpha_1 + \\dots + \\Delta\\alpha_{w-1}) \\ge 0.
\\end{cases} (3)$$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, similarly as the description of linear transformation, the branch number of an S-box S, denoted by BS, is defined as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathcal{B}_{S} = \\min_{\\Delta \\alpha \\neq 0} \\left\\{ \\operatorname{wt}(\\Delta \\alpha) + \\operatorname{wt}(\\Delta \\beta) \\mid \\#(\\Delta \\alpha, \\Delta \\beta) &gt; 0 \\right\\},\\,</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where #(∆α, ∆β) = #{x ∈ F w 2 | S(x)⊕S(x⊕∆α) = ∆β}. The linear constraints of S over integers are</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\begin{cases} \\sum_{i=0}^{w-1} (\\Delta \\alpha_i + \\Delta \\beta_i) \\ge \\mathcal{B}_S d_S, \\\\ d_S \\ge \\Delta \\alpha_i, \\ 0 \\le i \\le w - 1, \\\\ d_S \\ge \\Delta \\beta_i, \\ 0 \\le i \\le w - 1, \\end{cases}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(4)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where d&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; ∈ F&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a dummy variable.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The linear constraints (2), (3) and (4) of an S-box introduced above are not complete. That is, there exists a vector pair simultaneously satisfying inequalities (2), (3) and (4), while the vector pair is an impossible differential characteristic of the S-box. For this reason, Sun et al. proposed a new method based on computational geometry to obtain linear constraints of an S-box, where the constraints are selected from the H-representation of the convex hull of all differential characteristics [21].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">H-representation of convex hull. The convex hull of a set X is the minimum convex set containing X, where X is a set of some discrete points in R n. The convex hull can be regarded as the feasible solutions of a system of linear equalities and inequalities. There are a number of algorithms for computing the convex hull for a finite set of points. For an n × n S-box S, all differential characteristics can be regarded as some discrete points in R &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;n, by using the SAGE computer algebra system, the convex hull consisting of several inequalities can be obtained.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In general, the number of equalities and inequalities in the convex hull of a set X ⊂ R &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; increases rapidly as n increases. There are several hundreds of inequalities for a 4 × 4 S-box. To make an MILP problem solvable in practical time, one needs to select a small number of inequalities in the convex hull. Sun et al. utilized a greedy algorithm to choose some &quot;good&quot; inequalities [21].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We refer the readers to [16, 20, 21] for more information on an MILP problem and linear constraints describing several operations over finite fields with characteristic 2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we firstly introduce some notations used in the next subsections for convenience. Let P (P 0 ), C (C 0 ), ∆P and ∆C denote the plaintext, the ciphertext, and the differences of the plaintext and ciphertext, respectively. Let K&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; (K&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; i ), I&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; (I 0 i ) and O&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; (O&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; i ) denote the round subkey, the input and output of the operation SubColumn in the ith round, respectively. Similarly, let ∆K&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; , ∆I&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; and ∆O&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; denote the differences of the round subkey, the input and output of the operation SubColumn in the ith round, respectively.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With the preparations above, we will propose a related-key differential attack on 19-round RECTANGLE-80. To this end, we find a huge number of 15-round differential characteristics from the 2nd round to the 17th round with the same input, output and round subkey differences. Subsequently, a related-key differential attack on 19-round RECTANGLE-80 is obtained by respectively extending 2 rounds backward and forward.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-4" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">4.1 Differential characteristics</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this subsection, we use the methods proposed by Mouha et al. and Sun et al. to obtain several differential characteristics with high probabilities.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the RECTANGLE block cipher, only the operations XOR and S-box need to be transformed to linear constraints over integers. According to the descriptions in Section 3, the constraint conditions on XOR and S-box are obtained. In addition, since the differential of keys is necessarily nonzero in the related-key attack model, there is an additional constraint condition as &quot; <span class="math">\\Delta k_0 + \\Delta k_1 + \\cdots + \\Delta k_{79} \\geq 1</span> &quot;. The objective function is that &quot;min  <span class="math">\\sum \\delta</span> &quot;, where  <span class="math">\\delta</span>  denotes that the corresponding S-box is active or not introduced by (2) in Section 3. The process above is implemented to generate a &quot;.lp&quot; file which is an MILP instance containing an objective function and linear constraints. Then the Gurobi optimizer is used to solve the MILP instance.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The differential distributions of the S-box in RECTANGLE is showed in Table 1. According to Table 1, we can compute the probability for a specific differential characteristic. The results of related-key attacks on the n-round reduced RECTANGLE are showed in Table 2, where  <span class="math">7 \\le n \\le 15</span> . The values of the column &quot;Probability&quot; in Table 2 are the probabilities of specific differential characteristics which correspond to the numbers of active S-boxes in Table 2. When the numbers of the rounds are 7, 8 and 9 marked by &quot;*&quot;, the values in the column &quot;Number of active S-boxes&quot; correspond to the minimal numbers of active S-boxes for all possible differential characteristics. When the numbers of the rounds are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, the values in the column &quot;Number of active S-boxes&quot; correspond to the minimal numbers of active S-boxes for some possible differential characteristics.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-5" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">4.2 A related-key differential attack on RECTANGLE-80</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this subsection, we will give a related-key differential attack on RECTANGLE-80 by using the differential characteristics in Subsection 4.1 and respectively extending 2 rounds backward and forward. To this goal, we assume that the 19-round reduced RECTANGLE consists of 19 rounds of iterations and a final subkey XOR. We number the rounds from 0 to 19. The 0th round subkey  <span class="math">K_0</span>  is the master key and the final subkey is denoted by  <span class="math">K_{19}</span> . Next we propose our attack in detail.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We focus on illustrating how to extend 2 rounds backward and extending 2 rounds forward is similar. By the differences  <span class="math">\\Delta I_2</span>  and  <span class="math">\\Delta K_2</span> , the output difference  <span class="math">\\Delta O_1</span>  of the operation SubColumn in the 1st round is obtained by the inverse operations AddRoundKey and ShiftRow, which is listed below</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\Delta O_1 = \\begin{array}{c} 000001000001000\\\\ 00000010000000000\\\\ 00000000</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">By the differential distributions of the S-box in Table 1, we find that only when the input difference of the S-box is 1100, 0110, 1110, 1101, 0111 or 1111, the output difference of the S-box is 1000 for the 10th column, and similar observations are found for the 3rd and 9th columns. Therefore, the input difference  <span class="math">\\Delta I_1</span>  of the operation SubColumn in the 1st round must have the following form</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\Delta I_1 = \\begin{array}{c} 00000??00000?000\\\\ 000001?000000000\\\\ 00000??00000?000\\\\ 00000??00000?000 \\end{array}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where the mark &quot;?&quot; denotes an undetermined value 0 or 1. Further,  <span class="math">\\Delta I_1</span>  has  <span class="math">6 \\times 7 \\times 6 = 2^{7.98}</span>  cases in total. For a candidate  <span class="math">\\Delta I_1</span>  in the  <span class="math">2^{7.98}</span>  cases, the probability of  <span class="math">\\Delta O_1</span>  in (5) is equal to  <span class="math">\\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{7} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = 2^{-7.98}</span> . By the key schedule, the difference of the 1st round subkey is</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Similarly as the analysis of the 1st round, the output and input differences of the operation SubColumn in the 0th round are</p>

Therefore, for a random input difference  <span class="math">\\Delta I_0</span> , the probability of the output difference  <span class="math">\\Delta O_0</span>  belonging to the  <span class="math">2^{7.98}</span>  cases is  <span class="math">2^{-28.02}</span> .

    <h4 id="sec-6" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">5 Conclusions</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper, we used the methods proposed by Mouha  <span class="math">et\\ al.</span>  and Sun  <span class="math">et\\ al.</span>  to find out a 15-round differential characteristic with 26 active S-boxes and low Hamming weight of the input, output and round subkey differences. Then we found out a huge number of 15-round related-key differential characteristics with the obtained input, output and round subkey differences. The total probability is  <span class="math">2^{-60.5}</span> . Based on these differential characteristics, we proposed a related-key differential attack on the 19-round reduced RECTANGLE by respectively extending 2 rounds backward and forward, with a data complexity of  <span class="math">2^{62}</span> , a time complexity of  <span class="math">2^{67.42}</span>  19-round encryptions and a memory complexity of  <span class="math">2^{72}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A number of related-key differential characteristics with high total probability for more rounds may help to attack RECTANGLE for more rounds. It is meaningful to determine a lower bound of the number of active S-boxes for some rounds which can illustrate whether this cipher is security enough to resist against the standard related-key differential attack.</p>

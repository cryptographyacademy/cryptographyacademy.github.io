      <p class="text-gray-300">At the current state of the art, algebraic attacks are the most efficient method for finding preimages and collisions for arithmetization-oriented hash functions, such as the closely related primitives Poseidon/Poseidon2 and Neptune. In this paper, we revisit Gr&ouml;bner basis (GB) attacks that exploit subspace trails to linearize some partial rounds, considering both sponge and compression modes.

Starting from Poseidon&#x27;s original security evaluation, we identified some inaccuracies in the model description that may lead to misestimated round requirements. Consequently, we reevaluate and improve the proposed attack strategy. We find that depending on the concrete instantiation, the original security analysis of Poseidon under- or overestimates the number of rounds needed for security. Moreover, we demonstrate that GB attacks leveraging subspace trails can outperform basic GB attacks for Poseidon/Poseidon2 and Neptune.

We propose a variant of the previous attack strategy that exploits a crucial difference between Poseidon/Poseidon2 and Neptune: while Poseidon&#x27;s inverse round functions have a high degree, Neptune&#x27;s inverse external rounds maintain the same degree as the forward rounds. Using this new model, we demonstrate that Neptune&#x27;s security in compression mode cannot be reduced to its security against the Constrained-Input-Constrained-Output (CICO) problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a concrete example has been provided where finding preimages is easier than solving the corresponding CICO problem.

Our results emphasize the importance of considering the mode of operation in security analysis while confirming the overall security of Poseidon/Poseidon2 and Neptune against the presented algebraic attacks.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-2.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2.1 Modes of Operation: Sponge Hash and Compression Functions</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Poseidon, Poseidon2, and Neptune are permutations to be used either in sponge or compression mode of operation.<sup>5</sup> Here, we briefly recall them.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-2.1.1" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">2.1.1 Sponge Hash Function</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The sponge construction [BDPA08] can be used to model or implement many cryptographic primitives, including cryptographic hashes. Instantiated with a permutation  <span class="math">P: \\mathbb{F}_p^t \\to \\mathbb{F}_p^t</span> , it operates on an internal state of t field elements which is divided into two parts: the outer part of r field elements and the inner part of c field elements, where r is called the rate and c = t - r is called the capacity. The sponge construction is illustrated in Figure 1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In each step of the absorbing phase, r field elements are read from the input and are added to the outer part of the state, followed by the application of the permutation P. In each step of the squeezing phase, the first r field elements of the state are returned as output blocks, interleaved by the application of the permutation P.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Security.</strong> If the inner permutation resembles a random one, the sponge construction is indifferentiable from a random oracle for up to around  <span class="math">p^{c/2}</span>  queries [BDPA08]. To provide  <span class="math">\\kappa</span>  bits of security, we thus require  <span class="math">p^{c/2} \\geq 2^{\\kappa}</span> . To guarantee security against birthday bound attacks,  <span class="math">p^{d/2} \\geq 2^{\\kappa}</span>  has to hold, where d denotes the total digest length over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> . Further, we recall that the security of a sponge hash function is strictly related to the infeasibility of solving any CICO (<em>Constrained Input, Constrained Output</em>) problem for the permutation that instantiates the sponge [BDPA11].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 2</strong> (CICO problem). The invertible function  <span class="math">P: \\mathbb{F}_p^t \\to \\mathbb{F}_p^t</span>  is  <span class="math">\\kappa</span> -secure against the CICO- <span class="math">(n_I, n_O)</span>  problem (where  <span class="math">0 &lt; n_I, n_O &lt; t</span>  and  <span class="math">n_I + n_O \\le t</span> ) if no algorithm ,with expected complexity smaller than  <span class="math">2^{\\kappa}</span>  finds  <span class="math">x \\in \\mathbb{F}_p^{t-n_I} \\times \\{0\\}^{n_I}</span>  and  <span class="math">y \\in \\mathbb{F}_p^{t-n_O} \\times \\{0\\}^{n_O}</span>  such that P(x) = y. In other words,  <span class="math">n_I</span>  input elements and  <span class="math">n_O</span>  output elements are fixed. The CICO-(k, k) problem is typically referred to simply as the CICO-k problem.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"> <span class="math">&lt;sup&gt;^5\\&lt;/sup&gt;mathrm{For}</span>  completeness, we point out that only Poseidon2 has been formally proposed in the 2-to-1 compression mode.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;6</sup>The zeros can be replaced by other fixed constants. For example, fixing  <span class="math">n_I = c</span>  elements in the inner part to the initial value (IV) and  <span class="math">n_O = d</span>  elements in the outer part to the hash digest corresponds to a preimage attack on a 1-block sponge, see Figure 1b. Note that in this setting we always assume  <span class="math">r \\ge d</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Padding.</strong> Different padding rules apply depending on whether the input has a fixed length or a variable length. Here, we limit ourselves two padding rules especially suitable for arithmetization-oriented primitives, that is, the SAFE one proposed in [KBM23], and the one proposed in [LBM25]. In details:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>[KBM23] consists in (1st) adding the smallest number &lt; r of zeroes such that the  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> -size of  <span class="math">m||0^*</span>  is a multiple of r, and (2nd) making the initial value IV dependent on the size of the message to hash;</li>
      <li>[LBM25] consists in (1st) adding the smallest number &lt; r of zeroes such that the  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> -size of  <span class="math">m||0^*</span>  is a multiple of r, and (2nd) applying an invertible function with no fix point (e.g., a non-zero constant addition) to the inner value at the end of the absorption phase (equivalently, before the squeezing phase) in the case in which the size of m is not a multiple of r.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Here, we omit extra details, since all our attacks assume fixed-length inputs only.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-2.1.2" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">2.1.2 Cryptographic Compression Function (for Poseidon2)</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A fixed-size t-to-d compression function is crucial in, e.g., Merkle trees. Concretely, it is defined as  <span class="math">C: \\mathbb{F}_p^t \\to \\mathbb{F}_p^d</span>  where</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$C(x) := Trunc_d(P(x) + M \\times x)</span>$
,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where P is a permutation over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> , and M is an invertible matrix (not necessary the identity matrix &ndash; see e.g. Jive [BBC<sup>+</sup>23]). As discussed e.g. in [GHR<sup>+</sup>23], this approach can be seen as a permutation-based variant of the Davies-Meyer mode [PGV93, BRS02] which, like the latter, crucially relies on a feed-forward operation for one-wayness.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Security.</strong> For a security level of  <span class="math">\\kappa</span>  bits and assuming P behaves like a pseudo-random (known) permutation, C is a secure compression function with respect to collisions and (second) preimages if  <span class="math">p^d \\geq 2^{2\\kappa}</span>  (due to the birthday bound attack whose cost is in  <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}(p^{d/2})</span> ) and  <span class="math">p^{t-d} \\geq 2^{\\kappa}</span>  (in order to avoid a guessing attack on the truncated part). Moreover, in the case in which P is not a &quot;weak&quot; permutation (equivalently, it does not present any clear weakness), then the matrix M does not play any role on the security if P, since  <span class="math">\\mathrm{Trunc_d}(\\mathsf{P}(x) + M \\times x)</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathrm{Trunc_d}(\\mathsf{P}(M^{-1} \\times x) + x)</span>  are equivalent (see e.g. [GHR<sup>+</sup>23, Sect. 4.2] for more details). For this reason, in the following we simply assume M to be the identity matrix.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Due to the similarity between Poseidon and Poseidon2, we first present them in a general way. Next, we list the differences between the two.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">p &gt; 2^{30}</span>  be a prime number and let  <span class="math">2 \\le t \\le 24</span> . The Poseidon permutation P over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p^t</span>  is defined by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where M' is an invertible  <span class="math">t \\times t</span>  matrix, E is an external full round function, and I is an internal partial round function.

Both  <span class="math">M_{\\mathsf{E}}</span>  and  <span class="math">M_{\\mathsf{I}}</span>  are instantiated by the same Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) matrix M, fulfilling particular properties in order to prevent arbitrarily long subspace trails. We refer to [GRS21] and to Section 4 for more details regarding the condition for preventing arbitrarily long subspace trails. Here we limit ourselves to recall that such a condition is satisfied if the minimal polynomials of  <span class="math">M, M^2, \\ldots, M^\\ell</span>  for a certain  <span class="math">\\ell \\geq 1</span>  are irreducible and of maximum degree.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Details of Poseidon2.</strong> In Poseidon2, a restriction on the values of t is imposed, that is,  <span class="math">t \\in \\{2, 3, 4 \\cdot t&#x27;\\}</span>  for each  <span class="math">t&#x27; \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 6\\}</span> . The initial matrix M' is equal to  <span class="math">M_{\\mathsf{E}}</span> , that is,  <span class="math">M&#x27; = M_{\\mathsf{E}}</span> . (Note that the initial non-linear layer does not provide any additional security when, e.g., M' = identity matrix.)  <span class="math">M_{\\mathsf{E}}</span>  is MDS for t = 3, 4, and it has branch number t' + 4 for  <span class="math">t \\geq 8</span> . The matrix  <span class="math">M_{\\mathsf{I}}</span>  is different from  <span class="math">M_{\\mathsf{E}}</span> , and it must satisfy the same condition given before for Poseidon. Since the details of  <span class="math">M_{\\mathsf{E}}</span>  and  <span class="math">M_{\\mathsf{I}}</span>  do not impact our attacks, we refer to [GKS23] for more details.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">3 Preliminary: Solving Systems of Polynomial Equations</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Throughout this paper, we model the target primitive as a system of polynomial equations over a prime field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  and solve it using an off-the-shelf solver. To assess a primitive's security against algebraic attacks, it is crucial to consider the complexity of various solving methods. In this section, we recall several strategies for solving a system of m equations in n variables, assuming  <span class="math">n \\geq m</span> .<sup>10</sup> If n &gt; m, we limit ourselves to point out that besides trying to solve an under-determined system of equations, an attacker could simply fix n - m variables in order to decrease the degree and/or simplify the system of equations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We recall univariate system solving, i.e. factorization over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> , in Section 3.1, the special case of bivariate system solving in Section 3.2, and the general multivariate case in Section 3.3.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where zeros fill the blank spaces.

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 1.</strong> Let  <span class="math">F, G \\in \\mathbb{F}_p[x]</span>  as above, and let  <span class="math">\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_\\delta</span>  and  <span class="math">\\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_\\epsilon</span>  denote their respective roots (in the algebraic closure of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> ).

    <p class="text-gray-300">One important application of the resultant is in elimination theory, which focuses on eliminating variables from systems of multivariate polynomials.

In multiple variables, this approach can be generalized to removing (or eliminating) one variable &ndash; see [YZY <span class="math">^+24</span> ] for a recent example of it in symmetric cryptography.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">While an attacker of a primitive has to show that all of those steps are below the targeted security level, designers tend to focus only on the first step to derive &quot;secure&quot; round numbers.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It has been shown that structured polynomial systems stemming from symmetric cryptography are often not regular [DG10, BBLP22, KLR24, ABM24]. Nevertheless, since the previous formulas still provide (loose) upper bounds, designers often estimate the complexity of a Gr&ouml;bner basis attack using an equivalent regular system and then introduce additional rounds to account for potential non-regularity in the system. In the following, when estimating the complexity of Gr&ouml;bner basis attacks, we will refer to the following assumptions as the &quot;usual assumptions&quot;:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Assumption 1.</strong> Given a polynomial equation system  <span class="math">F_1 = \\cdots = F_n = 0</span> , we assume that the ideal generated by these polynomials is zero-dimensional and that the system is regular.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To verify whether the above assumptions hold, i.e., the value of  <span class="math">d_{\\rm reg}</span> , the cost to compute the Gr&ouml;bner basis, as well as the cost to find the solution, we will conduct small-scale experiments.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Practical experiments.</strong> All practical experiments are conducted on a machine with an Intel Xeon E5-2630 v3 @  <span class="math">2.40\\,\\mathrm{GHz}</span>  (using 8 cores) and 378 GB RAM under Debian 11 using Magma V2.26-2. We determine the degree of regularity in Magma by computing the &quot;degree-d Gr&ouml;bner basis&quot;: The degree of regularity is the smallest d for which this truncated Gr&ouml;bner basis remains a complete Gr&ouml;bner basis.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For all conducted experiments, we report the degree of regularity  <span class="math">d_{reg}</span> , the maximum degree  <span class="math">d_{max}^{DRL}</span>  of the elements of the DRL Gr&ouml;bner basis, as well as the Macaulay bound  <span class="math">d_{MAC}</span> . Additionally, we report the <em>solving degree</em>  <span class="math">d_{sol}</span> , as defined by Ding and Schmidt [DS13]. They argue that since algorithms such as F4 are computationally dominated by the <em>solving step</em> &ndash; the stage where Gaussian elimination takes the longest (or requires the most memory) &ndash; the solving degree, which is the highest degree of polynomials involved in this step, serves as a crucial measure for analyzing and optimizing algorithmic efficiency.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Resultant versus GB: 2 Equations in 2 Variables. Finally, we emphasize that it is more efficient to solve a system of 2 equations in 2 variables via the resultant rather than GB.

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we review the security analysis of Poseidon-like primitives as conducted by their designers, with a particular focus on algebraic attacks exploiting subspace trails to linearize some internal partial rounds.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Attacks on Poseidon vs. Poseidon2. As already pointed out in the introduction, we recall that all attacks defined on Poseidon2 can be extended to Poseidon as well, and vice-versa. Since Poseidon does not start with a matrix multiplication, the first full S-Box layer can be skipped for free [BBLP22], making it more vulnerable than Poseidon2.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-4.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.1 Basic Attacks Against Poseidon</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We start by recalling the (basic) algebraic attacks and respective attack complexities against the sponge hash function POSEIDON that exploit the link between the inputs and the outputs of the hash function without considering subspace trails. In the preimage-attack scenario, a special case of the CICO problem , an attacker has to solve a system of d equations of degree  <span class="math">\\alpha^{r_F+r_P}</span>  in r=t-c variables. Depending on the value of d, and in the case r=d, the minimum number of internal partial rounds to achieve  <span class="math">\\kappa</span> -bit security is estimated as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&bull; If d=1, the attacker can find roots as described in Section 3.1. The symmetric primitive is considered secure against this attack if  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{UNI}}(\\alpha^{r_F+r_P}) \\geq 2^{\\kappa}</span> , i.e.,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\alpha^{r_F+r_P} \\cdot \\log_2(\\alpha^{r_F+r_P}) \\cdot (\\log_2(\\alpha^{r_F+r_P}) + \\log_2(p)) \\cdot \\log_2(\\log_2(\\alpha^{r_F+r_P})) \\ge 2^{\\kappa}. \\quad (11)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&bull; If d=2, the attacker can use the resultant as described in Section 3.2.<sup>12</sup> Since both equations are of degree  <span class="math">\\alpha^{r_F+r_P}</span>  with respect to each of the variables, the symmetric primitive is considered secure against this attack if  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{RES}}(\\alpha^{r_F+r_P}, \\alpha^{r_F+r_P}) \\geq 2^{\\kappa}</span> , i.e.,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&bull; If  <span class="math">d \\ge 3</span> , the attacker can set up a GB attack as described in Section 3.3. Under the usual assumptions (see Assumption 1), we get</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$d_{\\text{reg}} = 1 + d \\cdot (\\alpha^{r_F + r_P} - 1),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">which implies that the symmetric primitive is considered secure against GB attacks if</p>

(13)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Under-Determined System of Equations (r &gt; d). In all cases where the system of equations is under-determined (that is, r &gt; d), the designers' security analysis suggested fixing some variables at random to obtain a determined system with as many equations as variables. However, this is not necessarily the best attack strategy, as a more careful choice of variables can simplify the system significantly. For example, [BBLP22] showed that one full round of Poseidon/Poseidon2 can be skipped by restricting inputs to a (properly chosen) one-dimensional subspace and exploiting the fact that the power map is a multiplicative homomorphism, i.e.,  <span class="math">(x \\cdot y)^{\\alpha} = x^{\\alpha} \\cdot y^{\\alpha}</span> . This external round-skipping trick uses up all available degrees of freedom, resulting in a determined system. An alternative strategy &ndash; pursued in this paper &ndash; is to use subspace trails to linearize as many internal partial rounds as possible. To exploit this internal round-skipping trick, the extra r - d degrees of freedom are required to map the input to a suitable (affine) subspace.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This section recalls Gr&ouml;bner basis attacks against Poseidon exploiting subspace trails to linearize some internal partial rounds, as described in [GKR<sup>+</sup>19, &sect; C.2.2], paragraph &quot;Exploiting the Subspace  <span class="math">S^{(i)}</span>  to Improve the Attack&quot;. In essence, the idea is to ensure that the input to the permutation maps to a one-dimensional affine subspace  <span class="math">S^{(t-1)} + \\gamma</span>  after the initial full rounds and some partial rounds, so that Lemma 2 can be used to linearize the subsequent t-1 partial rounds.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Algebraic Modeling Strategy. The idea of the attack can be summarized as follows:</p>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The values of s and s' are chosen in order to minimize the cost.

    <p class="text-gray-300">The advantage of such an attack strategy compared to the ones summarized in Section 4.1 is that some internal rounds behave linearly when the state belongs to the affine subspace  <span class="math">S^{(t-1)} + \\gamma</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">For completeness, we recall the designers' analysis of algebraic attacks against NEPTUNE.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Basic Attacks against Neptune. In the preimage-attack scenario, an attacker has to solve a system of d equations of degree  <span class="math">4^{r_F} \\cdot \\alpha^{r_P}</span>  in r = t - c variables. Depending on the value of d, and in the case r = d, the minimum number of internal partial rounds to achieve  <span class="math">\\kappa</span> -bit security is estimated as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&bull; If d = 1, the attacker can find roots as described in Section 3.1. The symmetric primitive is considered secure against this attack if</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$C_{\\text{UNI}}(4^{r_F} \\cdot \\alpha^{r_P}) \\ge 2^{\\kappa} \\,. \\tag{20}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&bull; If d=2, the attacker can use the resultant as described in Section 3.2. Since both equations are of degree  <span class="math">4^{r_F} \\cdot \\alpha^{r_P}</span>  with respect to each of the variables, the symmetric primitive is considered secure against this attack if</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$4 \\cdot (4^{r_F} \\cdot \\alpha^{r_P})^3 \\cdot (\\log_2 (4^{r_F} \\cdot \\alpha^{r_P}))^2 \\cdot (1 + \\log_2 (\\log_2 (4^{r_F} \\cdot \\alpha^{r_P}))) \\ge 2^{\\kappa}. \\tag{21}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&bull; If  <span class="math">d \\ge 3</span> , the attacker can set up a GB attack as described in Section 3.3. Under the usual assumptions (see Assumption 1), we get</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$d_{\\text{reg}} = 1 + d \\cdot (4^{r_F} \\cdot \\alpha^{r_P} - 1),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">which implies that the symmetric primitive is considered secure against GB attacks if</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$C_{GB}(d, d_{reg}) = \\left( \\binom{1 + d \\cdot 4^{r_F} \\cdot \\alpha^{r_P}}{d} \\right)^{\\omega} \\ge 2^{\\kappa}.</span>$
(22)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Resistance Against Attacks Exploiting Subspace Trails. To protect against algebraic attacks exploiting subspace trails, the designers of NEPTUNE increased the number of partial rounds by t. This choice is motivated by the fact that t-1 is the maximum length of a subspace trail associated with a non-null subspace, i.e., the maximum number of rounds we could possibly skip using subspace trails.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we revisit the GB attack on Poseidon presented in Section 4.3 and provide a formal analysis for both Poseidon2 and Neptune. We recall that one extra initial full round can be attacked in the case of Poseidon for free.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-5.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5.1 Considerations About the Designers' Analysis of Poseidon</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As mentioned earlier, the designers' analysis of the attack recalled in Section 4.3 is not precise, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions about its actual cost and feasibility. Below, we discuss the specific issues in detail. We mainly focus on the sponge construction, as POSEIDON was originally defined in this mode, and provide analogous considerations for the compression case where relevant.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Conservative Approach: About the Dimension of the Subspace.</strong> It is assumed that an attacker can cover <em>t</em> &minus; 1 rounds by using a subspace of dimension one. However, since conditions for both the initial value in the inner part (<em>c</em> &ge; 1 conditions) and the digest (<em>d</em> &ge; 1 conditions) need to be satisfied, the remaining degrees of freedom are not enough to practically achieve such a result. More precisely, an attacker can cover at most 0 &le; <em>t</em> &minus; (<em>c</em> + <em>d</em>) &le; <em>t</em> &minus; 2 rounds without exhausting the degrees of freedom necessary to solve the CICO problem/compute a preimage of the hash function in sponge mode. In compression mode, we get <em>t</em>&minus;(<em>c</em> + <em>d</em>) &le; <em>t</em>&minus;1 by artificially setting <em>c</em> = 0. Hence, using <em>t</em>&minus;1 could be a way to introduce a security margin against this type of attack in the design analysis, as done by the designers of Neptune.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Conservative Approach: About the Round Number Derivation.</strong> The designers of Poseidon derive the minimum number of partial rounds required for security using a lower bound based on their estimate of the attack cost, namely, <em>&alpha;</em> (<em>t</em>+<em>d</em>)&middot;(<em>r<sup>F</sup></em> +<em>r<sup>P</sup></em> &minus;<em>&#8467;</em>)<em>/</em>2 instead of (<em>t</em>+<em>d</em>)&middot;<em>&alpha;</em> (<em>rF</em> +<em>rP</em> &minus;<em>&#8467;</em>)<em>/</em>2 <em>t</em>+<em>d &omega;</em> . Notably, this approach might significantly overestimate the number of rounds required to ensure security. While such conservatism is reasonable from a designer's perspective and can be interpreted as introducing a security margin, our goal is to understand the actual attack complexity across different parameter choices.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>About the &quot;Middle Part&quot;.</strong> When dealing with the &quot;middle part&quot; covering <em>t</em>&minus;1 rounds, the coset <em>&gamma;</em> of the one-dimensional affine subspace S (<em>t</em>&minus;1) + <em>&gamma;</em> is not fixed in advance. However, this approach does not truly exploit the existence of a subspace trail to completely linearize internal rounds. Indeed, <em>t</em> &minus; 1 non-linear equations of degree <em>&alpha; <sup>t</sup></em>&minus;<sup>1</sup> are needed to model the propagation of the coset through the partial rounds, as the coset lies in a subspace of dimension <em>t</em> &minus; 1. <em>In order to solve this issue, we simply fix the coset &gamma; of the subspace in advance</em>. In particular, since no secret key material is involved, the attacker can just impose that the input of the hash falls into the desired affine subspace S (<em>&#8467;</em>) + <em>&gamma;</em> after the &quot;initial part&quot;. Consequently, the output coset <em>&sigma;</em> of <em>M<sup>&#8467;</sup></em> &times; S(<em>&#8467;</em>) + <em>&sigma;</em> can be precomputed by applying <a href="#page-15-1">Lemma 2.</a> In the following, we will use this approach.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>About the &quot;Final Part&quot;.</strong> The &quot;final part&quot; is described by <em>t</em> equations. However, <em>d</em> equations are sufficient to match the target hash value, where <em>d</em> denotes the digest.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>About the Choice of</strong> <em>s</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>s</em> <strong>&prime; .</strong> The subspace S (<em>&#8467;</em>) is placed exactly at the middle of the partial rounds, that is, <em>s</em> = <em>s</em> &prime; &asymp; <em>r<sup>P</sup></em> &minus;(<em>t</em>&minus;1) 2 . However, no theoretical argument is given to support this choice. In the following, we formally analyze how to choose <em>s</em> and <em>s</em> &prime; in order to minimize the cost of the attacks.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Regularity Assumption.</strong> The designers adopt the common strategy of analyzing only the first step of a GB attack and relying on the Macaulay bound, which typically only serves as a loose upper bound on the degree of regularity when the system is not regular. To ensure comparability from a designer's perspective, we follow the same approach and work with the assumptions stated in <a href="#page-13-1">Assumption 1.</a> However, we complement this analysis with practical small-scale experiments, including an evaluation of the FGLM step, to substantiate our arguments and assess the reliability of the theoretical bounds in practice. We point out that due to the rapid growth of the degree of the equations as a power of <em>&alpha;</em>, we have been able to perform experiments only for <em>&alpha;</em> = 3 and with reduced versions of the system (smaller number of external rounds and up to 5 internal rounds). However, we are confident that our findings generalize to larger values of <em>&alpha;</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>About the Maximum Degree.</strong> Poseidon was originally proposed over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  with  <span class="math">p \\approx 2^{256}</span>  only. Given the number of rounds, the maximum degree is never achieved.<sup>14</sup> However, recent versions of Poseidon (including Poseidon2) have been introduced for much smaller values of p, such as  <span class="math">p = 2^{64} - 2^{32} + 1</span>  or  <span class="math">p = 2^{31} - 1</span> . In these cases, the maximum degree could be achieved due to the large number of internal rounds. In particular, adding more rounds does not (necessarily) increase the degree. However, a formal analysis of this is missing in the original Poseidon paper. Therefore, in our analysis, we also take the size of p into account.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-5.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5.2 Algebraic Modeling Strategy</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the following, we revisit the algebraic model provided by the designers for attacks on Poseidon and Poseidon2 that exploit subspace trails to linearize internal rounds (cf. Section 4.3). However, we consider a more general setting, where:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;14</sup>We recall that the maximum degree of an invertible function over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p^t</span>  is  <span class="math">t \\cdot (p-2)</span> .</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">6 Start-in-the-Middle GB Attack Exploiting Subspace Trails</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Instead of starting from the permutation/hash input, it is possible to directly start from a subspace  <span class="math">\\mathcal{S}^{(\\ell)}</span> , i.e., in the middle. In particular, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the input of the hash and the input of the subspace since we are working with permutation. However, using this strategy, one needs to work in the backwards as well as the forwards direction. This highlights a crucial difference between Poseidon/Poseidon2 and Neptune, as we will see later. To keep the discussion general in what follows, we denote the degrees of the round functions in the respective directions as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\zeta = \\deg \\mathsf{E}</span>$
<span class="math">\\overline{\\zeta} = \\deg \\mathsf{E}^{-1}</span>   <span class="math">\\alpha = \\deg \\mathsf{I}</span>   <span class="math">\\overline{\\alpha} = \\deg \\mathsf{I}^{-1}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In general, a Start-in-the-Middle (SitM) strategy is particularly interesting if  <span class="math">\\overline{\\zeta}</span>  and/or  <span class="math">\\overline{\\alpha}</span>  are small as well. Concrete examples of symmetric primitives that satisfy this requirement are Neptune and GMiMC. In the case of Neptune, the external rounds are defined via a Lai-Massey construction of degree 4, thus  <span class="math">\\zeta=\\overline{\\zeta}=4</span> . GMiMC [AGP+19] is a Feistel scheme, in which each round has degree  <span class="math">d\\geq 3</span>  (where d is the smallest integer co-prime with p-1). Hence, every round of GMiMC has degree d in the forward and backward direction. In contrast, it is not hard to observe that Poseidon does not satisfy the requirement just given. Indeed, it is sufficient to notice that the degree of the inverse round of Poseidon is almost maximum.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-6.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">6.1 Algebraic Modeling Strategy</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As before, we assume that the attacker uses a subspace trail of length  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  to linearize partial rounds, where  <span class="math">1 \\le \\ell \\le t - (c + d)</span> .</p>

As before, the coset  <span class="math">\\gamma</span>  of the affine subspace  <span class="math">\\mathcal{S}^{(\\ell)} + \\gamma</span>  is fixed in advance. The algebraic modeling proceeds as follows, capturing each component in detail:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(a) Backward part: Given  <span class="math">v \\in \\mathcal{S}^{(\\ell)}</span>  as before (cf. Model 1), the attacker goes backwards to the permutation input x, that is,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$M&#x27;^{-1} \\circ \\mathsf{E}^{-r_f} \\circ \\mathsf{I}^{-s}(v+\\gamma) = x.</span>$
(34)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Importantly, neither in sponge nor in compression mode it is necessary to actively introduce variables to model the permutation input x, as we will soon see.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(b) Middle part: As before, the application of the next  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  partial rounds is equivalent to an affine transformation of  <span class="math">v \\in \\mathcal{S}^{(\\ell)}</span> , plus some precomputable  <span class="math">\\sigma \\in \\mathbb{F}_p^t</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(c) Forward part: As before, the output  <span class="math">w + \\sigma</span>  of the affine subspace trail is linked to the permutation output  <span class="math">y \\in \\mathbb{F}_p^t</span>  via</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathsf{E}^{r_f&#x27;} \\circ \\mathsf{I}^{s&#x27;}(w + \\sigma) = y. \\tag{35}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">While the last two steps are the same as before, the first one makes a crucial difference when setting up the attack. As we are going to show (especially for the case of Neptune), following this strategy can be much more efficient than the ones described so far.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A Variant of the Proposed Strategy. In the backward direction, a challenge arises if  <span class="math">\\overline{\\zeta}</span>  and/or  <span class="math">\\overline{\\alpha}</span>  are high. In particular, the degree of the resulting equations may reach its maximum after only a few rounds, rendering the attack using a direct model <em>infeasible</em>.<sup>17</sup> The only way to circumvent this issue is to operate at round level, which allows the attacker to work with equations of low degree  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  and/or  <span class="math">\\alpha</span> . However, this comes at the cost of a significantly increased number of variables and equations to solve. As a result, this strategy is not competitive with Model 1 (for Poseidon/Poseidon2) and Model 2 (for Neptune). We therefore do not consider this model further in the main text, and refer the interested reader to Appendix B for additional details.</p>

We recall that all results can be extended to Poseidon by using <em>r<sup>f</sup></em> &minus; 1, since the first full round of Poseidon can be skipped for free.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-7.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">7.1 Attack Complexity</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For Poseidon2 over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> , we have  <span class="math">\\zeta = \\alpha</span>  for some small  <span class="math">\\alpha \\geq 3</span>  with  <span class="math">\\gcd(p-1,\\alpha) = 1</span>  and  <span class="math">r_f = r_f&#x27;</span> . In particular, the degree of the inverse round functions is high. Thus, we concentrate on Model 1 (FW), presented in Section 5, and refer to Appendix B for the less competitive round-based version of Model 2. As noted before, all results presented for the sponge mode equivalently hold for the compression mode by setting c = 0.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Model 1 (FW).</strong> To minimize the attack complexity, the subspace is placed roughly at the middle of the partial rounds, as described in Section 5.3.2. For usual instantiations of Poseidon2 with  <span class="math">p \\ge 2^{31}</span> , the degrees of the equations do not reach the maximum possible degree of p-2.

      <h3 id="sec-7.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">7.2 Concrete Round Numbers</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we present concrete round numbers for different (practical) instantiations of Poseidon2 in sponge mode for  <span class="math">p \\in \\{2^{64}, 2^{96}, 2^{128}, 2^{256}\\}</span> ,  <span class="math">\\kappa = 128</span> , and  <span class="math">c = d = \\lceil \\log_p(2^{2\\kappa}) \\rceil</span> , Figure 5. We recall that similar results hold for Poseidon2 in compression mode by using c = 0. The given numbers indicate the minimum number of (internal) rounds necessary for guaranteeing security against the discussed algebraic attacks. Equivalently, they represent the maximum potential number of (internal) rounds that an attacker can break. Before going into the details, we emphasize that no instance of Poseidon2 (similarly for Poseidon) is broken by the considered attacks (with/without linearization of the internal rounds). Still, at the current state of the art, and in the case of Poseidon/Poseidon2, algebraic attacks are the most efficient attack vectors for finding preimages/collisions, hence, they are of crucial importance for practical use cases.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the following, we compare the following strategies illustrated in Figure 5:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>The <strong>blue</strong> line corresponds to the basic attacks against Poseidon/Poseidon2 proposed in Section 4.1. The system solving is based on Gr&ouml;bner bases for  <span class="math">d \\geq 3</span> , resultants for d = 2 and univariate solving for d = 1. For d = 2, we additionally compare the resultant (full squares) with the GB strategy (empty squares) to emphasize the different costs.</li>
      <li>The <strong>red</strong> dashed line represents the designers' analysis of Gr&ouml;bner basis attacks against Poseidon exploiting subspace trails, as recalled in Section 4.3.</li>
      <li>The green line corresponds to the Forward (FW) GB attack exploiting subspace trails, presented in Section 5.2. We recall that our FW model is a revision of the designers' analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&bull; The <strong>black</strong> lines indicate the designers' round number recommendation (cf. <a href="#page-8-0">Equa</a><a href="#page-8-0">tion (3))</a> without security margin (solid line; <em>r<sup>F</sup></em> = 6) and with security margin (dashed line; <em>r<sup>F</sup></em> = 6 and +7<em>.</em>5% on <em>r<sup>P</sup></em> ).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the following, we summarize our observations and conclusions for Poseidon/Poseidon2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Observation 1</strong>: <em>Basic Attacks vs. Forward GB Attack</em>. Depending on the concrete instantiation of Poseidon2, the forward Gr&ouml;bner basis attack that exploits subspace trails to linearize partial rounds can outperform the basic attack strategy &ndash; but not universally. Specifically, <a href="#page-28-0">Figure 5</a> shows:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>For <em>p</em> &asymp; 2 <sup>64</sup> <a href="#page-28-0">(Figure 5a)</a>, the FW-GB w/ subspace attack consistently outperforms the basic GB attack.</li>
      <li><em>p</em> &asymp; 2 <sup>96</sup> <a href="#page-28-0">(Figure 5b)</a>, the advantage of the FW-GB w/ subspace attack emerges only for larger state sizes, i.e., <em>t</em> &ge; 14.</li>
      <li>For <em>p</em> &asymp; 2 <sup>128</sup> <a href="#page-28-0">(Figure 5c)</a>, the FW-GB w/ subspace attack almost never outperforms the basic resultant attack, although it still beats basic GB for <em>t</em> &ge; 18.</li>
      <li>For <em>p</em> &asymp; 2 <sup>256</sup> <a href="#page-28-0">(Figures 5d</a> to <a href="#page-28-0">5f)</a>, the FW-GB w/ subspace attack never outperforms the basic attack, which in this case relies on univariate solving (due to <em>d</em> = 1).</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that across all instances, the effectiveness of the FW-GB w/ subspace attack increases with the state size <em>t</em>, since the number of linearizable rounds grows with <em>&#8467;</em> = <em>t</em> &minus; (<em>c</em> + <em>d</em>), while the basic attack's cost remains essentially constant. In general, the smaller the prime, the larger the parameters <em>c</em> and <em>d</em> must be to meet sponge security requirements. This reduces <em>&#8467;</em>, and thus the number of rounds that can be linearized. Surprisingly, however, for <em>d</em> &ge; 2, the FW-GB w/ subspace attack is still more effective for smaller primes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Observation 2</strong>: <em>Conservative Estimates in Designers' Analysis</em>. For small primes, the designers' analysis significantly overestimates the number of rounds needed for security against the FW-GB w/ subspace attack. In contrast, for large primes (e.g., <em>p</em> &asymp; 2 <sup>256</sup>), the estimates are very close to our results &ndash; though in some cases, they slightly underestimate the required number of rounds. This behavior is intuitive, as Poseidon was originally designed for large prime fields. In conclusion, while conservative round numbers strengthen security margins, they may negatively impact performance in small-field applications, where the overestimation is most pronounced.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Observation 3</strong>: <em>Impact of the Degree &alpha; of the S-Box</em>. To Study the effect of the S-Box degree <em>&alpha;</em>, we focus on the case <em>p</em> &asymp; 2 <sup>256</sup>, where higher values of <em>&alpha;</em> are typically required (see <a href="#page-28-0">Figures 5d</a> to <a href="#page-28-0">5f)</a>. All subfigures use the same scale to allow direct comparison. We observe the following:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>The number of internal partial rounds required for security decreases as <em>&alpha;</em> increases, which is expected: higher-degree S-Boxes lead to faster degree growth, improving resistance to algebraic attacks.</li>
      <li>The number of rounds needed to resist the FW-GB w/ subspace attack is almost the same across all considered <em>&alpha;</em> &isin; {3<em>,</em> 6<em>,</em> 7}. Interestingly, for small <em>t</em>, a higher <em>&alpha;</em> slightly reduces the number of rounds needed. For large <em>t</em>, the effect of <em>&alpha;</em> is minimal, since the number of linearizable rounds (i.e., <em>t</em> &minus; 2) dominates the attack's complexity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We further note that the gap between the basic attack (e.g., univariate solving) and the FW-GB w/ subspace attack narrows as <em>&alpha;</em> increases. As a result, in scenarios where <em>p</em> &minus; 1 is divisible by many small primes (i.e., higher <em>&alpha;</em> is necessary), the attack presented here could be decisive in determining the number of rounds needed to ensure the security of Poseidon/Poseidon2. <a href="#page-27-0">18</a></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>18</sup>For example, <em>p</em> = 2<sup>256</sup> + 1105635 satisfies that <em>p</em> &minus; 1 is divisible by 3<em>,</em> 5<em>,</em> 7<em>,</em> 11 and 13. Hence, <em>&alpha;</em> = 17.</p>

      <li>Positioning of the Subspace: Both GB and FGLM steps performed best when positioning the subspace trail in the middle of the internal rounds.

    <p class="text-gray-300">&bull; Computational Complexity: Assessing the relative hardness of the individual solving steps remains challenging. Empirically, the FGLM step requires more runtime than F4 in Magma, though both appear to scale similarly. When comparing estimated complexities, we observe the following relationship in our small-scale experiments:</p>

This suggests that, for deriving round numbers, it is reasonable to focus on the complexity of the first step in the Gr&ouml;bner basis attack.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, in Table 3, we compare the minimum round numbers necessary to guarantee security derived from the GB step (with the Macaulay bound) against those derived from the FGLM step (using our conjectured  <span class="math">d_{\\mathcal{I}}</span> ). The results are similar overall, though for smaller values of t, the FGLM-based approach tends to predict a higher number of secure rounds. We are currently not able to explain this fact, and we leave its analysis as an open problem for future work.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we provide concrete results for Neptune in sponge mode and perform practical experiments to support our arguments.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-8.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">8.1 Attack Complexity</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For Neptune over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> , we have  <span class="math">\\zeta=\\overline{\\zeta}=4</span>  due to the Lai-Massey construction in the external rounds,  <span class="math">\\alpha\\geq 3</span>  small and  <span class="math">\\overline{\\alpha}=\\alpha^{-1}</span>  large. Thus, unlike for Poseidon2, both algebraic models exploiting subspace trails can be applied efficiently, and we fix  <span class="math">\\ell=t-(c+d)=r-d</span>  to minimize the cost (i.e., linearize the maximum number of partial rounds). Further, we have  <span class="math">r_f&gt;r_f&#x27;</span> . In Section 8.2 we will see that the SitM strategy outperforms the FW strategy to attack Neptune in Sponge mode in all scenarios.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Model 1 (FW).</strong> To minimize the attack complexity, the subspace is placed roughly at the middle of the partial rounds with a slight shift towards the beginning, as described in Section 5.3.2.

    <p class="text-gray-300">p-2, i.e. the requirements in Equation (30) are fulfilled. Thus, the cost of the FW-GB attack is given by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Under the usual assumptions (see Assumption 1) and given that the maximum degree is not reached, we get the following attack complexities:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&bull; If d=c=1, the attacker has to solve a system of two equations in two variables. Using the resultant approach, and since typically  <span class="math">4^{r_f&#x27;} \\cdot \\alpha^{r_P-\\ell} \\geq 4^{r_f}</span> , the cost is estimated as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;19</sup>Indeed, for  <span class="math">s \\ge 1</span> , the attacker has to work at round level to cover the s rounds between the output of the full/external rounds and the input to the subspace trail, see Appendix B.3.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-8.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8"><strong>8.2 Concrete Round Numbers</strong></h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The concrete numbers for Neptune in sponge mode are given in <a href="#page-33-0">Figure 7.</a> <a href="#page-32-2">20</a> In particular:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>The <strong>blue</strong>, <strong>green</strong>, and <strong>black</strong> lines represent the same strategies given before (cf. <a href="#page-26-0">Section 7.2)</a>;</li>
      <li>The <strong>orange</strong> line corresponds to the Start-in-the-Middle (SitM) GB attack exploiting subspace trails to linearize some internal partial rounds (see <a href="#page-22-2">Section 6.1)</a>. Similar to before, for <em>c</em> + <em>d</em> = 2, we compare the standard GB approach (full circles) with the resultant approach (empty circle) to solve the system in order to emphasize the different costs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We recall that the designers did not provide an analysis of GB attacks exploiting subspace trails. Instead, they simply accounted for such attacks by adding <em>t</em> additional (partial) rounds.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As before, although no Neptune instance is broken by the considered algebraic attacks &ndash; whether or not internal rounds are linearized using subspace trails &ndash; these remain the strongest known approaches for finding preimages or collisions. Therefore, they are of critical importance in practical applications.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Observation 4</strong>: <em>Forward vs. SitM Attack</em>. As expected, the SitM-GB w/ subspace attack (in orange) outperforms the FW approach from <a href="#page-17-1">Section 5</a> in all cases. For larger <em>p</em>, the SitM approach additionally benefits from the smaller system it operates on and the applicability of the resultant technique.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Observation 5</strong>: <em>Basic Attacks vs. SitM Attack</em>. The relation between the basic attack (in blue) and the FW-GB w/ subspace attack (in green) is very similar to what we previously observed in <a href="#page-28-0">Figure 5.</a> Notably, for large primes <em>p</em> &asymp; 2 <sup>256</sup> and <em>c</em> = <em>d</em> = 1 <a href="#page-33-0">(Figures 7d</a> to <a href="#page-33-0">7f)</a>, the basic attack &ndash; based on univariate solving &ndash; remains dominant. However, in the uncommon case where both <em>&alpha;</em> and <em>t</em> are large in this setting, the SitM attack becomes competitive, approaching the efficiency of the basic attack. This suggests that when a sufficiently large number of rounds can be linearized, the SitM strategy can even outperform univariate solving based attacks.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-8.3" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8"><strong>8.3 Practical Verification</strong></h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the following, we compare our theoretical predictions regarding the behavior of the Gr&ouml;bner basis attack against Neptune with our experimental results. We exemplarily use <a href="#page-34-0">Figures 8</a> and <a href="#page-35-1">9</a> to discuss our findings for the two approaches exploiting subspaces to linearize some partial rounds, i.e., the Forward (FW) and the Start-in-the-Middle (SitM) strategy presented in <a href="#page-20-0">Sections 5.3</a> and <a href="#page-23-0">6.2,</a> and refer to <a href="#page-47-0">Appendix C</a> for concrete numbers.</p>

      <li><em>GB Step</em>: The Macaulay bound overestimates the degree of regularity. Notably, both the Macaulay bound and the degree of regularity exhibit similar growth patterns, forming a staircase-like structure. Specifically, two consecutive steps show the same value, followed by a jump upwards.</li>

Note that we could not practically verify this observation for values of t larger than 4, as the Sage scripts did not finish. However, we expect the behavior to remain the same. Note that this influences the attack complexity described in Section 8.1 for these instances, in particular for larger values of t. For the round numbers presented in Section 8.2, only the case t0 with t1 is affected, resulting in the derived round number being one higher. See Figures 7a to 7c. We leave the problem to further investigate the degree and density of the (external round) equations open for future work.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As we already pointed out in the introduction, in several works published in the literature, authors reduce the security of their proposed designs to the security against CICO problem (see, e.g., the security analysis of Poseidon/Poseidon2, Neptune, Anemoi, Griffin, and Monolith). For a concrete example, we recall the discussion of the CICO problem in the security analysis of the Poseidon2 compression function [GKS23, Sect. 7.2]:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&quot;[...] For the sponge mode using only a single permutation call, solving the CICO problem directly translates to a preimage attack on the sponge, and conversely, a preimage attack on the sponge mode is a solution to the CICO problem. Solving CICO is also sufficient to break the compression mode, but an attack on the compression</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>mode does not necessarily result in a solution to the CICO problem. Still, the CICO problem gives a good estimate of the strength of a cryptographic permutation, and of how much it deviates from a strong one.</em>&quot;</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Indeed, security against the CICO problem is not sufficient to guarantee the security of a compression function. In particular, it is not possible <em>in general</em> to reduce the security of a compression function to the security against the CICO problem. To support this claim, we present a concrete example based on Neptune in compression mode.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Remark</em> 3<em>.</em> We emphasize that Neptune was originally proposed in sponge mode only <a href="#page-41-3">[GOPS22]</a>. However, there is no a priori reason why it could not be used in compression mode as well. The results of this section suggests that the security of Neptune in compression mode should be carefully analyzed, and it cannot be derived directly from the sponge case.</p>

We omit the concrete complexity formulas, as Neptune has not been formally defined in compression mode, and instead refer the reader to <a href="#page-25-2">Sections 6.3.2</a> and <a href="#page-30-1">8.1</a> for details.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-9.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8"><strong>9.2 Concrete Round Numbers</strong></h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we present some concrete instances of Neptune for which finding a preimage in compression mode is cheaper than solving the CICO problem. Concrete results are given in <a href="#page-37-0">Figure 10</a> for several values of <em>p</em>. In particular:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>The <strong>blue</strong> line corresponds to the basic attacks against Poseidon/Poseidon2 proposed in <a href="#page-14-1">Section 4.1.</a> The system solving is based on Gr&ouml;bner bases for <em>d</em> &ge; 3, resultants for <em>d</em> = 2 and univariate solving for <em>d</em> = 1. For <em>d</em> = 2, we compare the resultant (full squares) with the GB strategy (empty squares) to emphasize the different costs.</li>
      <li>The <strong>orange</strong> line corresponds to the Start-in-the-Middle (SitM) GB attack exploiting subspace trails to linearize some internal partial rounds (see <a href="#page-22-2">Section 6.1)</a> for solving the CICO problem. It is equivalent to the one in <a href="#page-30-0">Section 8.</a></li>
      <li>The <strong>purple</strong> line corresponds to the SitM GB exploiting subspace trails to linearize some internal partial rounds (see <a href="#page-22-2">Section 6.1)</a> for attacking Neptune in compression mode. For <em>d</em> = 2, we compare the standard GB approach (full circles) with the resultant approach (empty circle) to emphasize the different costs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">    <img src="_page_37_Figure_2.jpeg" alt="" class="my-4 max-w-full" />
</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 10: Minimum number of internal rounds  <span class="math">r_P</span>  required to achieve  <span class="math">\\kappa=128</span> -bit security for Neptune over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  in sponge mode (capacity c and digest d set to  <span class="math">\\lceil \\log_p(2^{2\\kappa}) \\rceil</span> ) and compression mode, plotted against varying state sizes t. We compare against the designers' recommendation for  <span class="math">r_P</span>  (with and without +12.5% security margin). The orange and purple curves are based on algebraic models that exploit a subspace trail of maximum length  <span class="math">\\ell=t-(c+d)</span>  to linearize internal rounds, starting from the permutation input (FW) or the middle (SitM). Here,  <span class="math">\\omega=2</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&bull; The <strong>black</strong> lines indicate the designers' round number recommendation for the sponge case (with <em>c</em> = 0 for dealing with the compression case, see <a href="#page-9-4">Section 2.3)</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As we expected, the attack described here is the most efficient one, being able to break more rounds than any other approach (with/without linearization of the internal partial rounds) described so far. Notable, this attack also outperforms the basic attack for <em>p</em> &asymp; 2 <sup>256</sup> and <em>d</em> = 1, regardless of the statesize or powermap degree <em>&alpha;</em> (cf. <a href="#page-32-0">Section 8.2)</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we revisit the attack from Section 6, now modeling the backward direction at round-level. This allows the approach to be applied even when the degree of the inverted rounds is high, as is the case for Poseidon/Poseidon2. To this end, recall that we denote the degree of an external round by  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  and that of an internal round by  <span class="math">\\alpha</span> . The attacker can skip  <span class="math">1 \\le \\ell \\le t - (c+d)</span>  partial rounds using a subspace  <span class="math">\\mathcal{S}^{(\\ell)}</span>  of dimension  <span class="math">D = t - \\ell</span> , under the assumption that t &gt; c + d.</p>

      <h3 id="app-b.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">B.1 Attack on Poseidon2 (and Poseidon) in Sponge Mode</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Algebraic Model for Sponge Mode (CICO problem). Assuming  <span class="math">\\ell = t - (c + r)</span>  and s' = 0 (i.e., the best case for the attacker), it follows that:</p>

    <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-400 text-sm list-none">
      <li>Backward part: this part takes into account the initial external full rounds, and it is described by  <span class="math">(r_f 1) \\cdot t + c + s</span>  equations of degree  <span class="math">\\alpha</span> ;</li>
      <li><span class="math">Middle\\ part</span> : the middle part is described by linear equations only. Hence, the output of this middle part is defined via t linear equations;</li>
      <li>Forward part: d equations of degree  <span class="math">\\min\\{p-2, \\alpha^{r_f+r_P-s-(r-d)}\\}\\</span>  in order to satisfy the hash value conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Overall, we have  <span class="math">(r_f - 1) \\cdot t + c + d + s \\equiv r_f \\cdot t + s + d - r</span>  equations in  <span class="math">(r_f - 1) \\cdot t + c + d + s \\equiv r_f \\cdot t + d + s - r</span>  variables (as before, we emphasize that the number of equations is equal to the number of variables).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Under the usual assumptions (see <a href="#page-13-1">Assumption 1)</a>, the complexity of the attack is given by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that the complexity of this attack is, in general, <em>much higher</em> than the ones presented in <a href="#page-26-1">Section 7.1.</a> This is due to the higher number of equations that the attacker has to solve, which follows from the fact that the attacker has to work at round level in order to handle the initial full rounds in the backward direction.</p>

      <h3 id="app-b.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8"><strong>B.2 Attack on Poseidon2 (Poseidon) in Compression Mode</strong></h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The attack on Poseidon2 in compression mode works similarly to the one in sponge mode. The main difference relies on the fact that no constraint is imposed on the input of the hash (remember that this corresponds to <em>c</em> = 0), while such an input is added to the output of the hash. In more detail, assuming <em>s</em> = 0:</p>

    <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-400 text-sm list-none">
      <li><em>Backward part:</em> this part takes into account the initial external full rounds, and it is described by (<em>r<sup>f</sup></em> &minus; 1) &middot; <em>t</em> + <em>d</em> equations of degree <em>&alpha;</em>. With respect to the attack in <a href="#page-45-0">Appendix B.1,</a> no constraint is imposed on the input of the hash. Still, the attacker has to identify it in order to sum with the output of the hash;</li>
      <li><em>Middle part:</em> the middle part is described by linear equations only. Hence, the output of this middle part is defined via <em>t</em> linear equations;</li>
      <li><em>Forward part: d</em> equations of degree <em>&alpha; r<sup>f</sup></em> +<em>r<sup>P</sup></em> &minus;(<em>r</em>&minus;<em>d</em>) in order to satisfy the hash value conditions. We emphasize that the equations that describes this part are different from the ones in <a href="#page-45-0">Appendix B.1,</a> since an additional term corresponding to the input of the hash is summed here.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Overall, with respect to the attack presented in <a href="#page-45-0">Appendix B.1,</a> the number of equations is smaller, that is, (<em>r<sup>f</sup></em> &minus; 1) &middot; <em>t</em> + 2 &middot; <em>d</em> instead of <em>r<sup>f</sup></em> &middot; <em>t</em> + <em>d</em>. Still, the conclusion given in <a href="#page-45-0">Appendix B.1</a> regarding the prohibitive cost of the attack for concrete instances of Poseidon2 (and Poseidon) holds here as well. For this reason, we omit the details of the complexity cost of the attack.</p>

      <h3 id="app-b.3" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8"><strong>B.3 Attack on Neptune in Sponge Mode</strong></h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">By exploiting the same strategy proposed for Poseidon in <a href="#page-45-0">Appendix B.1,</a> we have to solve a system of equations defined as follows:</p>

    <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-400 text-sm list-none">
      <li><em>Backward part:</em> this part takes into account the initial external full rounds, and it is described by (<em>r<sup>f</sup></em> &minus; 1) &middot; <em>t</em> + <em>c</em> equations of degree 4 and <em>s</em> equations of degree <em>&alpha;</em>;</li>
      <li><em>Middle part:</em> the middle part is described by linear equations only. Hence, the output of this middle part is defined via <em>t</em> linear equations;</li>
      <li><em>Forward part: d</em> equations of degree min{<em>p</em> &minus; 2<em>,</em> 4 <em>rf</em> &middot; <em>&alpha; <sup>r</sup><sup>P</sup></em> <sup>&minus;</sup><em>s</em>&minus;<em><sup>&#8467;</sup></em>} in order to satisfy the hash value conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is not hard to check that the best situation for the attacker occurs for <em>&#8467;</em> = <em>t</em>&minus;(<em>c</em>+<em>d</em>) = <em>r</em>&minus;<em>d</em>. Indeed, note that <em>&#8467;</em> does not impact the number of equations and the number of variables, but only the degree of the involved equations. Hence, it makes sense to maximize it.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As a result, we have (<em>r<sup>f</sup></em> &minus;1)&middot;<em>t</em>+<em>c</em>+<em>d</em>+<em>s</em> = <em>r<sup>f</sup></em> &middot;<em>t</em>+<em>s</em>+<em>d</em>&minus;<em>r</em> equations in (<em>r<sup>f</sup></em> &minus;1)&middot;<em>t</em>+<em>c</em>+<em>d</em>+<em>s</em> = <em>r<sup>f</sup></em> &middot; <em>t</em> + <em>d</em> + <em>s</em> &minus; <em>r</em> variables.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Under the usual assumptions (see <a href="#page-13-1">Assumption 1)</a>, the cost of the attack against Neptune is given by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\min_{0\\leq s\\leq r_P-(r-d)}\\left(\\begin{pmatrix}1+((r_f-1)\\cdot t+c)\\cdot 4+s\\cdot \\alpha+d\\cdot 4^{r_f&#x27;}\\cdot \\alpha^{r_P-s-(r-d))}\\\\ (r_f-1)\\cdot t+s+d+c\\end{pmatrix}\\right)^{\\omega},</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We conducted practical experiments to verify the described GB attacks with linearization of some internal rounds. We focused on <em>&alpha;</em> = 3 due to system size limitations in Magma. Experiments covered up to 5 internal rounds.</p>

      <li>For the GB step, we report the Macaulay bound, the maximum degree in the drl Gr&ouml;bner basis, the degree of regularity, as well as the solving degree (timing-based) as defined in <a href="#page-12-0">Section 3.3.</a></li>
      <li>For the FGLM step, we provide the B&eacute;zout bound, the quotient space dimension (logged by Magma), and the number of solutions over F<em>p</em>.</li>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that some cells contain two values (the right one in braces), corresponding to different choices for the subspace trail starting round.

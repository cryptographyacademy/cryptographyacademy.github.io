    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Abstract.</strong> At the current state of the art, algebraic attacks are the most efficient method for finding preimages and collisions for arithmetization-oriented hash functions, such as the closely related primitives Poseidon/Poseidon2 and Neptune. In this paper, we revisit Gröbner basis (GB) attacks that exploit subspace trails to linearize some partial rounds, considering both sponge and compression modes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Starting from Poseidon's original security evaluation, we identified some inaccuracies in the model description that may lead to misestimated round requirements. Consequently, we reevaluate and improve the proposed attack strategy. We find that depending on the concrete instantiation, the original security analysis of Poseidon under- or overestimates the number of rounds needed for security. Moreover, we demonstrate that GB attacks leveraging subspace trails can outperform basic GB attacks for Poseidon/Poseidon2 and Neptune.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We propose a variant of the previous attack strategy that exploits a crucial difference between Poseidon/Poseidon2 and Neptune: while Poseidon's inverse round functions have a high degree, Neptune's inverse external rounds maintain the same degree as the forward rounds. Using this new model, we demonstrate that Neptune's security in compression mode cannot be reduced to its security against the Constrained-Input-Constrained-Output (CICO) problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a concrete example has been provided where finding preimages is easier than solving the corresponding CICO problem.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our results emphasize the importance of considering the mode of operation in security analysis while confirming the overall security of Poseidon/Poseidon2 and Neptune against the presented algebraic attacks.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-2" class="text-2xl font-bold">1 Introduction</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The Poseidon hash function [GKR<sup>+</sup>21] can be seen as a de facto standard for use-cases of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs and protocols. It has seen widespread adoption across the foundations of decentralized computation and storage [Ale, Min, Dus, Mat, Net, Pol], privacy tools and developer frameworks [Ano, Wor, ide, Zerb, Zera, Sta, Con], and hardware acceleration [Fab, Ing]. Notably, Poseidon is currently under consideration by the Ethereum Foundation (EF) for integration into its core infrastructure. To support this effort, EF is coordinating a broad cryptanalysis initiative. Also, in the scholarly literature on ZK-proofs – private/verifiable computation more broadly – Poseidon is frequently regarded as the default choice for various needs around cryptographic hashing [KZHB25, BMNW24, DKKW25, Lee24, PSG<sup>+</sup>24, CGG<sup>+</sup>23, ZBK<sup>+</sup>22, SG23, ASTW22].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Defined over a prime field F<em><sup>p</sup></em> for <em>p</em> ≫ 3, Poseidon is based on the Hades design strategy <a href="#page-41-1">\\[GLR</a><sup>+</sup>20], which generalizes the Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN) construction. In SPN, each round is defined via the concatenation of two layers: a non-linear layer and a linear one. Focusing on the non-linear layer, a non-linear function called S-Box is applied on each chunk of the state. The Hades design makes use of external rounds with full S-Box layers (which are placed at the beginning and at the end), and of internal rounds with partial S-Box layers, in which some S-Boxes are removed/replaced by the identity map. The particular layout of Poseidon combined with the use of low-degree invertible S-Boxes leads to good performance in ZK proofs by reducing the number of non-linear operations (i.e., multiplications) in the verification process— a key cost metric for ZK-friendly schemes. Consequently, two evolutions of such design appeared in the literature, namely Poseidon2 [\\[GKS23\\]](#page-41-2) and Neptune [\\[GOPS22\\]](#page-41-3). For Poseidon2, the main difference lies in the linear layer matrices, which were chosen and fixed to improve plain performance. Neptune, on the other hand, introduces more significant changes, affecting both linear and non-linear layers. Specifically, it uses two distinct non-linear layers: one for internal partial rounds and a new one for external full rounds, aiming to minimize non-linear operations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Due to their specific design aspects, Poseidon, Poseidon2, and Neptune are more vulnerable to algebraic attacks than "standard/classical" symmetric primitives. While their designers provide concrete security arguments to mitigate algebraic attacks, these remain less explored and understood compared to statistical attacks. Indeed, most standard symmetric primitives, such as the AES and/or Keccak/SHA-3, are more vulnerable to statistical attacks, and until recently, the symmetric cryptography community primarily focused on this threat. However, the situation is different for ZK-friendly symmetric primitives, which by design admit a simple algebraic description. The introduction of new ZK-friendly designs has spurred increased cryptanalytic effort in the algebraic direction, leading to new insights and the breakage of many such schemes, as evidenced by the growing number of algebraic attacks in recent literature, including <a href="#page-38-3">\\[ACG</a><sup>+</sup>19, <a href="#page-39-1">BCD</a><sup>+</sup>20, <a href="#page-40-5">EGL</a><sup>+</sup>20, <a href="#page-41-4">GKRS22,</a> <a href="#page-42-7">GRS21,</a> <a href="#page-42-8">KR21,</a> <a href="#page-39-2">BBLP22,</a> <a href="#page-39-3">BBL</a><sup>+</sup>24, <a href="#page-42-9">KLR24,</a> <a href="#page-43-8">YZY</a><sup>+</sup>24].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In order to increase our confidence regarding the security of ZK-friendly schemes, the goal of this paper is to better understand the security of Poseidon-like primitives with respect to Gröbner Basis (GB) attacks.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-3" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8"><strong>1.1 State of the Art: Gröbner Basis Cryptanalysis of Poseidon</strong></h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To contextualize our contribution, we first recall the algebraic attacks on Poseidon. Notably, these attacks also extend to Poseidon2 and Neptune.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Attack by Beyne et al. <a href="#page-39-1">\\[BCD</a><sup>+</sup>20].</strong> The first third-party cryptanalysis of Hades-like designs appeared in <a href="#page-39-1">\\[BCD</a><sup>+</sup>20], exploiting a weakness in the choice of the linear layer. Assume, for simplicity, the usual case in which the internal partial rounds are composed of a single S-Box. Since the S-Box layer is only partial, it is <em>always</em> possible to find a set of inputs for which the S-Boxes remain constant (i.e., not active) over several consecutive rounds. The number of rounds for which this property holds is tightly linked to the matrix used in the linear layer. A weak choice allows this property to persist over an <em>arbitrary</em> number of partial rounds. Beyne <em>et al.</em> in <a href="#page-39-1">\\[BCD</a><sup>+</sup>20] exploited this weakness to mount a GB attack on HadesMiMC <a href="#page-41-1">\\[GLR</a><sup>+</sup>20], a keyed cipher structurally similar to Poseidon. It was further analyzed by Keller and Rosemarin in [\\[KR21\\]](#page-42-8) and subsequently addressed by Grassi <em>et al.</em> [\\[GRS21\\]](#page-42-7), who proposed a matrix selection algorithm to prevent the property from extending indefinitely. Nevertheless, even with well-chosen matrices, this property always holds for a certain <em>finite</em> number of partial rounds.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Designers' Analysis.</strong> As just explained, it is always possible to find a set of inputs for which the S-Boxes defining a certain finite number of the partial rounds remain constant. From an algebraic point of view, this means that the degree of the system of equations describing those rounds does not change (i.e., remains constant). This property can potentially be exploited to speed up an algebraic attack. In particular, an attacker can leverage a so-called <em>subspace trail</em> to linearize some partial rounds by employing the following approach:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>a certain number of equations to ensure that the input message falls into the desired subset of texts after a certain number of rounds;</li>

      <li>a certain number of equations that describe the evolution of the text for the internal rounds in which the S-Boxes inputs are constant;</li>

      <li>a certain number of equations that link the output of the previous rounds to the output of the primitive (and so, to the desired hash value/collision).</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As recalled in Section 4, Poseidon's designers were aware of this attack strategy, and an analysis was presented in the original Poseidon paper. However, upon closer examination, we identified certain imprecisions, which we discuss in Section 5.1. This forms the starting point of our work.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Other Results on Poseidon. For completeness, we note that several other cryptanalytic results on Poseidon have been presented in the literature. To begin with, [FP20, Thm. 10] provided a closed-form expression of the degree of the univariate polynomial in the lexicographic Gröbner basis. As part of addressing several of the EF's cryptographic challenges<sup>3</sup>, [BBLP22] showed that the first full round of Poseidon can be skipped – an issue that has since been addressed in Poseidon2 and Neptune. However, by restricting to a one-dimensional subspace, [BBLP22] further demonstrated how to skip an additional full round of Poseidon, and consequently, one full round of Poseidon2. More recently, [ABM24] reconsidered the possibility of setting up GB attacks by considering systems of equations defined at round level, as originally described in [GLR<sup>+</sup>20]. Based on practical experiments, they argue that the resistance of Poseidon against GB attacks is overstated, providing an affected instance for an unusual security level of  <span class="math">\\kappa = 1024</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Recent Results Not Applied to Poseidon. The FreeLunch [BBL+24] approach – successfully applied to full-round instances of Anemoi, Arion, and GRIFFIN – consists in choosing a monomial ordering such that the round-level model of the CICO-1 problem (cf. Definition 2) is already a Gröbner basis, allowing a dedicated solving algorithm to be applied. However, for Poseidon/Poseidon2/Neptune, the low degree of the S-Box reduces CICO-1 to solving a single univariate polynomial (cf. Section 4.1), a step involved in all solving strategies. Thus, this type of attack is not worthwhile for Poseidon-like primitives, as also noted in a more recent iterated resultants-based approach [BBB+25]. Whether either technique can be extended to more general settings remains an open question. A more general approach to Gröbner basis cryptanalysis is described in [KLR24], which suggests analyzing the complexity of all three steps of a GB attack using both theoretical bounds and experimental conjectures for key metrics. However, no rigorous application of the Six worlds of Gröbner Basis Cryptanalysis has yet been carried out for Poseidon-like primitives.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-4" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">1.2 Our Contribution</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper, we re-consider Gröbner basis attacks against Poseidon, Poseidon2, and Neptune that exploit the existence of subspace trails for linearizing some internal partial rounds. Our results are a step forward in the understanding of the security of Poseidon-like schemes against such GB attacks. As an additional result, such attacks point out an important difference between the security requirements of Poseidon/Poseidon2 and Neptune when used in compression mode. Our main results as well as previous work are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 1. In this paper, we do not make a distinction between the minimum number of rounds needed to guarantee security and the maximum number of rounds that an attacker can break. For completeness, we point out that a similar approach has already been used in the literature for analyzing the security of arithmetization-friendly schemes, see e.g. [BCD+20, BBLP22, GKRS22].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Designers' Analysis Revisited: Improved Variant of the GB Attack with Linearization of the Internal Partial Rounds. As previously mentioned, the starting point of this paper is the analysis conducted by Poseidon's designers. As our first contribution, in Section 5, we revisit their analysis, addressing the discovered inaccuracies and refining the general attack strategy. Depending on the instantiation of Poseidon/Poseidon2, our analysis shows that the designers' estimation of the number of rounds required for the targeted security level (or equivalently, the number of rounds that can potentially be attacked) is, in some cases, overestimated and, in others, underestimated – see Figure 5 in Section 7.2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We compare our model against one that does not utilize subspace trails and observe that the best algebraic attack depends on the concrete instantiation of Poseidon/Poseidon2. For a security level of 128 bits, we find that when the prime field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  is relatively small (e.g.,  <span class="math">p \\approx 2^{32}</span>  or  <span class="math">2^{64}</span> ) and the hash output consists of several field elements, Gröbner basis attacks exploiting the linearization of internal partial rounds via subspace trails (as in Section 5.2) are most effective. Conversely, for larger prime fields (e.g.,  <span class="math">p \\approx 2^{256}</span> ), where the hash output consists of only one or two field elements, the best algebraic attacks do not rely on subspaces but instead exploit alternative solving techniques, such as computing the roots of a univariate polynomial or resultants, to improve efficiency. Analogous attacks (and conclusions) are proposed and hold for Neptune.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 2. The main differences between Poseidon and Poseidon2 are (1) the details of the linear layer, and (2) the fact that Poseidon2 starts with a matrix multiplication, which is absent in Poseidon. Since our attacks do not depend on the details of the linear layer, in this paper we limit ourselves to focus on Poseidon2 only. Our attacks extend naturally to Poseidon as well, as we will discuss in detail later.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Start-in-the-Middle GB Attack with Linearization of Internal Rounds: Crucial Difference between Poseidon/Poseidon2 and Neptune. Our second main contribution introduces an alternative model that leverages the linearization of certain internal partial rounds through proper subspace trails, see Section 6. In the previous strategy, the attacker starts at the hash input and imposes equations to ensure that the input message falls into the desired subspace after a certain number of rounds, allowing the attack to exploit the subspace trail. In contrast, our new model directly starts in this subspace, eliminating the need for such equations. However, when reasoning about the hash input, this requires working in the backward direction:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>For Poseidon/Poseidon2, the degree of the inverse round is almost maximal.</li>

      <li>For Neptune, the inverse round has the same degree as the forward round for the external round function.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that for Poseidon/Poseidon2, this attack never outperforms the previous one due to the high degrees. In contrast, for Neptune, it is typically the most competitive one among the GB attacks exploiting subspace trails, even outperforming the basic GB attack without linearization of internal rounds. Concrete results are given in Sections 7.2 and 8.2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Security of Neptune in Compression Mode. Finally, as our third main contribution, we evaluate Neptune in compression mode.<sup>4</sup> In Section 9, we adapt the previously described attack to this setting. Consequently, we show that the number of rounds required to guarantee security of Neptune against the Constrained Input Constrained Output (CICO) problem is not sufficient to prevent our attack when Neptune is used in compression mode. This result is highly relevant, as the CICO problem is the primary algebraic attack vector considered by the designers of arithmetization-oriented symmetric primitives—see, e.g., the security analysis of Poseidon/Poseidon2, Neptune, Anemoi [BBC+23], Griffin [GHR+23], and Monolith [GKL+24]. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show that the common assumption—namely, that algebraic security against CICO implies security of the symmetric primitive against algebraic attacks—does not hold in general. This finding is especially important for the community as it increases our confidence regarding the security of arithmetization-oriented symmetric primitives used in compression mode.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Practical Verification. In line with [KLR24], we experimentally verified all the proposed attacks, and we present the results of our tests in Sections 7.3 and 8.3. With the exception of Neptune, our tests suggest that the resulting systems are in general not regular. Still, by extrapolating the complexity of the dominating step from these experimental results, we have been able to confirm the number of internal partial rounds necessary for achieving security predicted by our theory. Moreover, while we could not formulate a closed-form conjecture for the degree of regularity, we did establish a conjecture for the quotient space dimension in the attack described in Section 5.2 for Poseidon2. We leave the open problem to prove this conjecture (and other observations related to our experiments) for future work.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Impact of Our Results. We emphasize that the security of Poseidon/Poseidon2 and Neptune is not threatened by the attacks presented in this paper. Indeed, the number of rounds of Poseidon/Poseidon2 and Neptune are usually derived by the interpolation attack [JK97]. At the same time, the interpolation attack against a hash function does not allow to find preimages and/or collisions, and it can be considered as a distinguisher on the internal permutation that instantiates the sponge hash function or the compression one. Instead, at the current state of the art, the most efficient strategy for finding preimages and/or collisions consists of using Gröbner bases (or factorization/resultant depending on the number of equations and variables that define the system of equations to solve). From this point of view, our results provide a better estimation of the security margin of Poseidon/Poseidon2 and Neptune against this crucial attack.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Organization.</strong> Section 2 recalls the necessary preliminaries on the targeted designs. Section 3 provides background on algebraic system solving. Section 4 presents the designers' original security analysis and introduces the notion of subspace trails. In Section 5, we revisit and refine the algebraic model initially proposed by the designers of Poseidon. Section 6 presents an alternative attack in which the attacker "starts in the middle", i.e., directly within an affine subspace. Finally, Sections 7 to 9 give concrete results for Poseidon/Poseidon2 and Neptune in sponge and compression mode.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span id="page-4-0"></span> <span class="math">&lt;sup&gt;^4&lt;/sup&gt;</span> Note that while Neptune was originally proposed in sponge mode, there is no a priori reason why it cannot also be used in compression mode.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-6" class="text-2xl font-bold">2.1 Modes of Operation: Sponge Hash and Compression Functions</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Poseidon, Poseidon2, and Neptune are permutations to be used either in sponge or compression mode of operation.<sup>5</sup> Here, we briefly recall them.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-7" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">2.1.1 Sponge Hash Function</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The sponge construction [BDPA08] can be used to model or implement many cryptographic primitives, including cryptographic hashes. Instantiated with a permutation  <span class="math">P: \\mathbb{F}_p^t \\to \\mathbb{F}_p^t</span> , it operates on an internal state of t field elements which is divided into two parts: the outer part of r field elements and the inner part of c field elements, where r is called the rate and c = t - r is called the capacity. The sponge construction is illustrated in Figure 1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In each step of the absorbing phase, r field elements are read from the input and are added to the outer part of the state, followed by the application of the permutation P. In each step of the squeezing phase, the first r field elements of the state are returned as output blocks, interleaved by the application of the permutation P.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Security.</strong> If the inner permutation resembles a random one, the sponge construction is indifferentiable from a random oracle for up to around  <span class="math">p^{c/2}</span>  queries [BDPA08]. To provide  <span class="math">\\kappa</span>  bits of security, we thus require  <span class="math">p^{c/2} \\geq 2^{\\kappa}</span> . To guarantee security against birthday bound attacks,  <span class="math">p^{d/2} \\geq 2^{\\kappa}</span>  has to hold, where d denotes the total digest length over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> . Further, we recall that the security of a sponge hash function is strictly related to the infeasibility of solving any CICO (<em>Constrained Input, Constrained Output</em>) problem for the permutation that instantiates the sponge [BDPA11].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span id="page-6-0"></span><strong>Definition 2</strong> (CICO problem). The invertible function  <span class="math">P: \\mathbb{F}_p^t \\to \\mathbb{F}_p^t</span>  is  <span class="math">\\kappa</span> -secure against the CICO- <span class="math">(n_I, n_O)</span>  problem (where  <span class="math">0 &lt; n_I, n_O &lt; t</span>  and  <span class="math">n_I + n_O \\le t</span> ) if no algorithm ,with expected complexity smaller than  <span class="math">2^{\\kappa}</span>  finds  <span class="math">x \\in \\mathbb{F}_p^{t-n_I} \\times \\{0\\}^{n_I}</span>  and  <span class="math">y \\in \\mathbb{F}_p^{t-n_O} \\times \\{0\\}^{n_O}</span>  such that P(x) = y. In other words,  <span class="math">n_I</span>  input elements and  <span class="math">n_O</span>  output elements are fixed. The CICO-(k, k) problem is typically referred to simply as the CICO-k problem.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span id="page-6-1"></span> <span class="math">&lt;sup&gt;^5\\&lt;/sup&gt;mathrm{For}</span>  completeness, we point out that only Poseidon2 has been formally proposed in the 2-to-1 compression mode.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span id="page-6-3"></span><sup>&</sup>lt;sup>6</sup>The zeros can be replaced by other fixed constants. For example, fixing  <span class="math">n_I = c</span>  elements in the inner part to the initial value (IV) and  <span class="math">n_O = d</span>  elements in the outer part to the hash digest corresponds to a preimage attack on a 1-block sponge, see Figure 1b. Note that in this setting we always assume  <span class="math">r \\ge d</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Padding.</strong> Different padding rules apply depending on whether the input has a fixed length or a variable length. Here, we limit ourselves two padding rules especially suitable for arithmetization-oriented primitives, that is, the SAFE one proposed in [KBM23], and the one proposed in [LBM25]. In details:</p>

    <h4 id="sec-8" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">2.1.2 Cryptographic Compression Function (for Poseidon2)</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A fixed-size t-to-d compression function is crucial in, e.g., Merkle trees. Concretely, it is defined as  <span class="math">C: \\mathbb{F}_p^t \\to \\mathbb{F}_p^d</span>  where</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">C(x) := Trunc_d(P(x) + M \\times x)</span> ,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where P is a permutation over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> , and M is an invertible matrix (not necessary the identity matrix – see e.g. Jive [BBC<sup>+</sup>23]). As discussed e.g. in [GHR<sup>+</sup>23], this approach can be seen as a permutation-based variant of the Davies-Meyer mode [PGV93, BRS02] which, like the latter, crucially relies on a feed-forward operation for one-wayness.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Security.</strong> For a security level of  <span class="math">\\kappa</span>  bits and assuming P behaves like a pseudo-random (known) permutation, C is a secure compression function with respect to collisions and (second) preimages if  <span class="math">p^d \\geq 2^{2\\kappa}</span>  (due to the birthday bound attack whose cost is in  <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}(p^{d/2})</span> ) and  <span class="math">p^{t-d} \\geq 2^{\\kappa}</span>  (in order to avoid a guessing attack on the truncated part). Moreover, in the case in which P is not a "weak" permutation (equivalently, it does not present any clear weakness), then the matrix M does not play any role on the security if P, since  <span class="math">\\mathrm{Trunc_d}(\\mathsf{P}(x) + M \\times x)</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathrm{Trunc_d}(\\mathsf{P}(M^{-1} \\times x) + x)</span>  are equivalent (see e.g. [GHR<sup>+</sup>23, Sect. 4.2] for more details). For this reason, in the following we simply assume M to be the identity matrix.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Algebraic models for symmetric primitives typically give rise to equation systems that generate a zero-dimensional ideal  <span class="math">\\mathcal{I}</span> , that is, the number of solutions in  <span class="math">\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_p</span>  is finite. A widely used strategy is, therefore, to employ Gröbner bases [Buc76, CLO18] to solve such systems. In particular, to find the common zeros, one proceeds as follows:</p>

      <li>2. Apply the FGLM basis conversion algorithm [FGLM93] to convert it into a Gröbner basis with respect to the LEX (lexicographic) order.</li>

      <li>3. Since the LEX Gröbner basis admits a triangular form [Bar04, § 1.3], solutions can be recovered and extended iteratively by solving (a system of) univariate equation(s) [CLO18, § 3.1]:</li>

    <p class="text-gray-300">While an attacker of a primitive has to show that all of those steps are below the targeted security level, designers tend to focus only on the first step to derive "secure" round numbers.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In general, the degree of regularity and the quotient space dimension are upper bounded by the <em>Macaulay bound</em> and the <em>Bézout bound</em>, respectively:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It has been shown that structured polynomial systems stemming from symmetric cryptography are often not regular [DG10, BBLP22, KLR24, ABM24]. Nevertheless, since the previous formulas still provide (loose) upper bounds, designers often estimate the complexity of a Gröbner basis attack using an equivalent regular system and then introduce additional rounds to account for potential non-regularity in the system. In the following, when estimating the complexity of Gröbner basis attacks, we will refer to the following assumptions as the "usual assumptions":</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span id="page-13-1"></span><strong>Assumption 1.</strong> Given a polynomial equation system  <span class="math">F_1 = \\cdots = F_n = 0</span> , we assume that the ideal generated by these polynomials is zero-dimensional and that the system is regular.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To verify whether the above assumptions hold, i.e., the value of  <span class="math">d_{\\rm reg}</span> , the cost to compute the Gröbner basis, as well as the cost to find the solution, we will conduct small-scale experiments.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Practical experiments.</strong> All practical experiments are conducted on a machine with an Intel Xeon E5-2630 v3 @  <span class="math">2.40\\,\\mathrm{GHz}</span>  (using 8 cores) and 378 GB RAM under Debian 11 using Magma V2.26-2. We determine the degree of regularity in Magma by computing the "degree-d Gröbner basis": The degree of regularity is the smallest d for which this truncated Gröbner basis remains a complete Gröbner basis.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For all conducted experiments, we report the degree of regularity  <span class="math">d_{reg}</span> , the maximum degree  <span class="math">d_{max}^{DRL}</span>  of the elements of the DRL Gröbner basis, as well as the Macaulay bound  <span class="math">d_{MAC}</span> . Additionally, we report the <em>solving degree</em>  <span class="math">d_{sol}</span> , as defined by Ding and Schmidt [DS13]. They argue that since algorithms such as F4 are computationally dominated by the <em>solving step</em> – the stage where Gaussian elimination takes the longest (or requires the most memory) – the solving degree, which is the highest degree of polynomials involved in this step, serves as a crucial measure for analyzing and optimizing algorithmic efficiency.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Resultant versus GB: 2 Equations in 2 Variables.

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we review the security analysis of Poseidon-like primitives as conducted by their designers, with a particular focus on algebraic attacks exploiting subspace trails to linearize some internal partial rounds.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Attacks on Poseidon vs. Poseidon2. As already pointed out in the introduction, we recall that all attacks defined on Poseidon2 can be extended to Poseidon as well, and vice-versa. Since Poseidon does not start with a matrix multiplication, the first full S-Box layer can be skipped for free [BBLP22], making it more vulnerable than Poseidon2.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-16" class="text-2xl font-bold">4.1 Basic Attacks Against Poseidon</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We start by recalling the (basic) algebraic attacks and respective attack complexities against the sponge hash function POSEIDON that exploit the link between the inputs and the outputs of the hash function without considering subspace trails. In the preimage-attack scenario, a special case of the CICO problem , an attacker has to solve a system of d equations of degree  <span class="math">\\alpha^{r_F+r_P}</span>  in r=t-c variables. Depending on the value of d, and in the case r=d, the minimum number of internal partial rounds to achieve  <span class="math">\\kappa</span> -bit security is estimated as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">• If d=1, the attacker can find roots as described in Section 3.1. The symmetric primitive is considered secure against this attack if  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{UNI}}(\\alpha^{r_F+r_P}) \\geq 2^{\\kappa}</span> , i.e.,</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\alpha^{r_F+r_P} \\cdot \\log_2(\\alpha^{r_F+r_P}) \\cdot (\\log_2(\\alpha^{r_F+r_P}) + \\log_2(p)) \\cdot \\log_2(\\log_2(\\alpha^{r_F+r_P})) \\ge 2^{\\kappa}. \\quad (11)</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">• If d=2, the attacker can use the resultant as described in Section 3.2.<sup>12</sup> Since both equations are of degree  <span class="math">\\alpha^{r_F+r_P}</span>  with respect to each of the variables, the symmetric primitive is considered secure against this attack if  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{RES}}(\\alpha^{r_F+r_P}, \\alpha^{r_F+r_P}) \\geq 2^{\\kappa}</span> , i.e.,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">• If  <span class="math">d \\ge 3</span> , the attacker can set up a GB attack as described in Section 3.3. Under the usual assumptions (see Assumption 1), we get</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">d_{\\text{reg}} = 1 + d \\cdot (\\alpha^{r_F + r_P} - 1),</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">which implies that the symmetric primitive is considered secure against GB attacks if</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">C_{GB}(d, d_{reg}) = \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 + d \\cdot \\alpha^{r_F + r_P} \\\\ d \\end{pmatrix} \\right)^{\\omega} \\ge 2^{\\kappa}.</span>  (13)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Under-Determined System of Equations (r > d). In all cases where the system of equations is under-determined (that is, r > d), the designers' security analysis suggested fixing some variables at random to obtain a determined system with as many equations as variables. However, this is not necessarily the best attack strategy, as a more careful choice of variables can simplify the system significantly. For example, [BBLP22] showed that one full round of Poseidon/Poseidon2 can be skipped by restricting inputs to a (properly chosen) one-dimensional subspace and exploiting the fact that the power map is a multiplicative homomorphism, i.e.,  <span class="math">(x \\cdot y)^{\\alpha} = x^{\\alpha} \\cdot y^{\\alpha}</span> . This external round-skipping trick uses up all available degrees of freedom, resulting in a determined system. An alternative strategy – pursued in this paper – is to use subspace trails to linearize as many internal partial rounds as possible. To exploit this internal round-skipping trick, the extra r - d degrees of freedom are required to map the input to a suitable (affine) subspace.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span id="page-14-2"></span><sup>&</sup>lt;sup>12</sup>We point out that the designers did not use the resultant for solving a system of 2 equations in 2 variables. We consider this strategy since it is more competitive than the GB approach.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Working at Round Level. We note that one can alternatively model the problem at round level by introducing variables for each S-Box at every round (see [ABM24]). However, we do not adopt this approach, as the designers of POSEIDON argue it is less effective than modeling the input-output relation directly (see, e.g., the conclusion in [GKR<sup>+</sup>19, App. C.2.2]). We leave it as an open problem to rigorously verify this claim.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This section recalls Gröbner basis attacks against Poseidon exploiting subspace trails to linearize some internal partial rounds, as described in [GKR<sup>+</sup>19, § C.2.2], paragraph "Exploiting the Subspace  <span class="math">S^{(i)}</span>  to Improve the Attack". In essence, the idea is to ensure that the input to the permutation maps to a one-dimensional affine subspace  <span class="math">S^{(t-1)} + \\gamma</span>  after the initial full rounds and some partial rounds, so that Lemma 2 can be used to linearize the subsequent t-1 partial rounds.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Algebraic Modeling Strategy. The idea of the attack can be summarized as follows:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">x \\in \\mathbb{F}_p^t \\xrightarrow{\\mathsf{I}^s \\circ \\mathsf{E}^{r_f} \\circ M&#x27;(\\cdot)} \\mathcal{S}^{(t-1)} + \\gamma \\xrightarrow{\\mathsf{I}^{t-1}(\\cdot)} M^{t-1} \\times \\mathcal{S}^{(t-1)} + \\sigma \\xrightarrow{\\mathsf{E}^{r_f&#x27;} \\circ \\mathsf{I}^{s&#x27;}(\\cdot)} y \\in \\mathbb{F}_p^t, \\tag{18}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">r_P = s + s&#x27; + t - 1</span> . In particular, a one-dimensional affine subspace  <span class="math">\\mathcal{S}^{(t-1)} + \\gamma</span>  is used to produce a subspace trail of length  <span class="math">\\ell = t - 1</span> , allowing for a linear mapping  <span class="math">\\mathcal{S}^{(t-1)} \\to M^{t-1} \\times \\mathcal{S}^{(t-1)}</span> . The scenario is then modeled as follows:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li><span id="page-16-1"></span>(a) Initial part: t equations of degree  <span class="math">\\alpha^{r_f+s}</span>  to choose inputs x that are in the affine subspace  <span class="math">\\mathcal{S}^{(t-1)} + \\gamma</span>  after  <span class="math">r_f</span>  full rounds and s partial rounds.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The values of s and s' are chosen in order to minimize the cost. In particular, POSEIDON's designers fixed s=s', approximately equal to  <span class="math">\\frac{r_P-(t-1)}{2}</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">For completeness, we recall the designers' analysis of algebraic attacks against NEPTUNE.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Basic Attacks against Neptune. In the preimage-attack scenario, an attacker has to solve a system of d equations of degree  <span class="math">4^{r_F} \\cdot \\alpha^{r_P}</span>  in r = t - c variables. Depending on the value of d, and in the case r = d, the minimum number of internal partial rounds to achieve  <span class="math">\\kappa</span> -bit security is estimated as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">• If d = 1, the attacker can find roots as described in Section 3.1. The symmetric primitive is considered secure against this attack if</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">C_{\\text{UNI}}(4^{r_F} \\cdot \\alpha^{r_P}) \\ge 2^{\\kappa} \\,. \\tag{20}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">• If d=2, the attacker can use the resultant as described in Section 3.2. Since both equations are of degree  <span class="math">4^{r_F} \\cdot \\alpha^{r_P}</span>  with respect to each of the variables, the symmetric primitive is considered secure against this attack if</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">4 \\cdot (4^{r_F} \\cdot \\alpha^{r_P})^3 \\cdot (\\log_2 (4^{r_F} \\cdot \\alpha^{r_P}))^2 \\cdot (1 + \\log_2 (\\log_2 (4^{r_F} \\cdot \\alpha^{r_P}))) \\ge 2^{\\kappa}. \\tag{21}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">• If  <span class="math">d \\ge 3</span> , the attacker can set up a GB attack as described in Section 3.3. Under the usual assumptions (see Assumption 1), we get</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Resistance Against Attacks Exploiting Subspace Trails. To protect against algebraic attacks exploiting subspace trails, the designers of NEPTUNE increased the number of partial rounds by t. This choice is motivated by the fact that t-1 is the maximum length of a subspace trail associated with a non-null subspace, i.e., the maximum number of rounds we could possibly skip using subspace trails.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we revisit the GB attack on Poseidon presented in Section 4.3 and provide a formal analysis for both Poseidon2 and Neptune. We recall that one extra initial full round can be attacked in the case of Poseidon for free.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-21" class="text-2xl font-bold">5.1 Considerations About the Designers' Analysis of Poseidon</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As mentioned earlier, the designers' analysis of the attack recalled in Section 4.3 is not precise, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions about its actual cost and feasibility. Below, we discuss the specific issues in detail. We mainly focus on the sponge construction, as POSEIDON was originally defined in this mode, and provide analogous considerations for the compression case where relevant.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Conservative Approach: About the Dimension of the Subspace.</strong> It is assumed that an attacker can cover <em>t</em> − 1 rounds by using a subspace of dimension one. However, since conditions for both the initial value in the inner part (<em>c</em> ≥ 1 conditions) and the digest (<em>d</em> ≥ 1 conditions) need to be satisfied, the remaining degrees of freedom are not enough to practically achieve such a result. More precisely, an attacker can cover at most 0 ≤ <em>t</em> − (<em>c</em> + <em>d</em>) ≤ <em>t</em> − 2 rounds without exhausting the degrees of freedom necessary to solve the CICO problem/compute a preimage of the hash function in sponge mode. In compression mode, we get <em>t</em>−(<em>c</em> + <em>d</em>) ≤ <em>t</em>−1 by artificially setting <em>c</em> = 0. Hence, using <em>t</em>−1 could be a way to introduce a security margin against this type of attack in the design analysis, as done by the designers of Neptune.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Conservative Approach: About the Round Number Derivation.</strong> The designers of Poseidon derive the minimum number of partial rounds required for security using a lower bound based on their estimate of the attack cost, namely, <em>α</em> (<em>t</em>+<em>d</em>)·(<em>r<sup>F</sup></em> +<em>r<sup>P</sup></em> −<em>ℓ</em>)<em>/</em>2 instead of (<em>t</em>+<em>d</em>)·<em>α</em> (<em>rF</em> +<em>rP</em> −<em>ℓ</em>)<em>/</em>2 <em>t</em>+<em>d ω</em> . Notably, this approach might significantly overestimate the number of rounds required to ensure security. While such conservatism is reasonable from a designer's perspective and can be interpreted as introducing a security margin, our goal is to understand the actual attack complexity across different parameter choices.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>About the "Middle Part".</strong> When dealing with the "middle part" covering <em>t</em>−1 rounds, the coset <em>γ</em> of the one-dimensional affine subspace S (<em>t</em>−1) + <em>γ</em> is not fixed in advance. However, this approach does not truly exploit the existence of a subspace trail to completely linearize internal rounds. Indeed, <em>t</em> − 1 non-linear equations of degree <em>α <sup>t</sup></em>−<sup>1</sup> are needed to model the propagation of the coset through the partial rounds, as the coset lies in a subspace of dimension <em>t</em> − 1. <em>In order to solve this issue, we simply fix the coset γ of the subspace in advance</em>. In particular, since no secret key material is involved, the attacker can just impose that the input of the hash falls into the desired affine subspace S (<em>ℓ</em>) + <em>γ</em> after the "initial part". Consequently, the output coset <em>σ</em> of <em>M<sup>ℓ</sup></em> × S(<em>ℓ</em>) + <em>σ</em> can be precomputed by applying <a href="#page-15-1">Lemma 2.</a> In the following, we will use this approach.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>About the "Final Part".</strong> The "final part" is described by <em>t</em> equations. However, <em>d</em> equations are sufficient to match the target hash value, where <em>d</em> denotes the digest.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>About the Choice of</strong> <em>s</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>s</em> <strong>′ .</strong> The subspace S (<em>ℓ</em>) is placed exactly at the middle of the partial rounds, that is, <em>s</em> = <em>s</em> ′ ≈ <em>r<sup>P</sup></em> −(<em>t</em>−1) 2 . However, no theoretical argument is given to support this choice. In the following, we formally analyze how to choose <em>s</em> and <em>s</em> ′ in order to minimize the cost of the attacks.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Regularity Assumption.</strong> The designers adopt the common strategy of analyzing only the first step of a GB attack and relying on the Macaulay bound, which typically only serves as a loose upper bound on the degree of regularity when the system is not regular. To ensure comparability from a designer's perspective, we follow the same approach and work with the assumptions stated in <a href="#page-13-1">Assumption 1.</a> However, we complement this analysis with practical small-scale experiments, including an evaluation of the FGLM step, to substantiate our arguments and assess the reliability of the theoretical bounds in practice. We point out that due to the rapid growth of the degree of the equations as a power of <em>α</em>, we have been able to perform experiments only for <em>α</em> = 3 and with reduced versions of the system (smaller number of external rounds and up to 5 internal rounds). However, we are confident that our findings generalize to larger values of <em>α</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>About the Maximum Degree.</strong> Poseidon was originally proposed over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  with  <span class="math">p \\approx 2^{256}</span>  only. Given the number of rounds, the maximum degree is never achieved.<sup>14</sup> However, recent versions of Poseidon (including Poseidon2) have been introduced for much smaller values of p, such as  <span class="math">p = 2^{64} - 2^{32} + 1</span>  or  <span class="math">p = 2^{31} - 1</span> . In these cases, the maximum degree could be achieved due to the large number of internal rounds. In particular, adding more rounds does not (necessarily) increase the degree. However, a formal analysis of this is missing in the original Poseidon paper. Therefore, in our analysis, we also take the size of p into account.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-22" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">5.2 Algebraic Modeling Strategy</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the following, we revisit the algebraic model provided by the designers for attacks on Poseidon and Poseidon2 that exploit subspace trails to linearize internal rounds (cf. Section 4.3). However, we consider a more general setting, where:</p>

By doing so, the following (at most)  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  partial rounds can be linearized. Finally, the attacker links the output of the subspace trail with the output of the hash. The algebraic modeling proceeds as follows, capturing each component in detail:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span id="page-19-1"></span><sup>&</sup>lt;sup>14</sup>We recall that the maximum degree of an invertible function over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p^t</span>  is  <span class="math">t \\cdot (p-2)</span> .</p>

    <h2 id="sec-27" class="text-2xl font-bold">6 Start-in-the-Middle GB Attack Exploiting Subspace Trails</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Instead of starting from the permutation/hash input, it is possible to directly start from a subspace  <span class="math">\\mathcal{S}^{(\\ell)}</span> , i.e., in the middle. In particular, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the input of the hash and the input of the subspace since we are working with permutation. However, using this strategy, one needs to work in the backwards as well as the forwards direction. This highlights a crucial difference between Poseidon/Poseidon2 and Neptune, as we will see later. To keep the discussion general in what follows, we denote the degrees of the round functions in the respective directions as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">\\zeta = \\deg \\mathsf{E}</span>   <span class="math">\\overline{\\zeta} = \\deg \\mathsf{E}^{-1}</span>   <span class="math">\\alpha = \\deg \\mathsf{I}</span>   <span class="math">\\overline{\\alpha} = \\deg \\mathsf{I}^{-1}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In general, a Start-in-the-Middle (SitM) strategy is particularly interesting if  <span class="math">\\overline{\\zeta}</span>  and/or  <span class="math">\\overline{\\alpha}</span>  are small as well. Concrete examples of symmetric primitives that satisfy this requirement are Neptune and GMiMC. In the case of Neptune, the external rounds are defined via a Lai-Massey construction of degree 4, thus  <span class="math">\\zeta=\\overline{\\zeta}=4</span> . GMiMC [AGP+19] is a Feistel scheme, in which each round has degree  <span class="math">d\\geq 3</span>  (where d is the smallest integer co-prime with p-1). Hence, every round of GMiMC has degree d in the forward and backward direction. In contrast, it is not hard to observe that Poseidon does not satisfy the requirement just given. Indeed, it is sufficient to notice that the degree of the inverse round of Poseidon is almost maximum.</p>

As before, the coset  <span class="math">\\gamma</span>  of the affine subspace  <span class="math">\\mathcal{S}^{(\\ell)} + \\gamma</span>  is fixed in advance.

    <p class="text-gray-300">(a) Backward part: Given  <span class="math">v \\in \\mathcal{S}^{(\\ell)}</span>  as before (cf. Model 1), the attacker goes backwards to the permutation input x, that is,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Importantly, neither in sponge nor in compression mode it is necessary to actively introduce variables to model the permutation input x, as we will soon see.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(b) Middle part: As before, the application of the next  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  partial rounds is equivalent to an affine transformation of  <span class="math">v \\in \\mathcal{S}^{(\\ell)}</span> , plus some precomputable  <span class="math">\\sigma \\in \\mathbb{F}_p^t</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(c) Forward part: As before, the output  <span class="math">w + \\sigma</span>  of the affine subspace trail is linked to the permutation output  <span class="math">y \\in \\mathbb{F}_p^t</span>  via</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\mathsf{E}^{r_f&#x27;} \\circ \\mathsf{I}^{s&#x27;}(w + \\sigma) = y. \\tag{35}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">While the last two steps are the same as before, the first one makes a crucial difference when setting up the attack. As we are going to show (especially for the case of Neptune), following this strategy can be much more efficient than the ones described so far.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A Variant of the Proposed Strategy. In the backward direction, a challenge arises if  <span class="math">\\overline{\\zeta}</span>  and/or  <span class="math">\\overline{\\alpha}</span>  are high. In particular, the degree of the resulting equations may reach its maximum after only a few rounds, rendering the attack using a direct model <em>infeasible</em>.<sup>17</sup> The only way to circumvent this issue is to operate at round level, which allows the attacker to work with equations of low degree  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  and/or  <span class="math">\\alpha</span> . However, this comes at the cost of a significantly increased number of variables and equations to solve. As a result, this strategy is not competitive with Model 1 (for Poseidon/Poseidon2) and Model 2 (for Neptune). We therefore do not consider this model further in the main text, and refer the interested reader to Appendix B for additional details.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the following, we summarize our observations and conclusions for Poseidon/Poseidon2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Observation 1</strong>: <em>Basic Attacks vs. Forward GB Attack</em>. Depending on the concrete instantiation of Poseidon2, the forward Gröbner basis attack that exploits subspace trails to linearize partial rounds can outperform the basic attack strategy – but not universally. Specifically, <a href="#page-28-0">Figure 5</a> shows:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>For <em>p</em> ≈ 2 <sup>64</sup> <a href="#page-28-0">\\(Figure 5a\\)</a>, the FW-GB w/ subspace attack consistently outperforms the basic GB attack.</li>

      <li><em>p</em> ≈ 2 <sup>96</sup> <a href="#page-28-0">\\(Figure 5b\\)</a>, the advantage of the FW-GB w/ subspace attack emerges only for larger state sizes, i.e., <em>t</em> ≥ 14.</li>

      <li>For <em>p</em> ≈ 2 <sup>128</sup> <a href="#page-28-0">\\(Figure 5c\\)</a>, the FW-GB w/ subspace attack almost never outperforms the basic resultant attack, although it still beats basic GB for <em>t</em> ≥ 18.</li>

      <li>For <em>p</em> ≈ 2 <sup>256</sup> <a href="#page-28-0">\\(Figures 5d</a> to <a href="#page-28-0">5f\\)</a>, the FW-GB w/ subspace attack never outperforms the basic attack, which in this case relies on univariate solving (due to <em>d</em> = 1).</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that across all instances, the effectiveness of the FW-GB w/ subspace attack increases with the state size <em>t</em>, since the number of linearizable rounds grows with <em>ℓ</em> = <em>t</em> − (<em>c</em> + <em>d</em>), while the basic attack's cost remains essentially constant. In general, the smaller the prime, the larger the parameters <em>c</em> and <em>d</em> must be to meet sponge security requirements. This reduces <em>ℓ</em>, and thus the number of rounds that can be linearized. Surprisingly, however, for <em>d</em> ≥ 2, the FW-GB w/ subspace attack is still more effective for smaller primes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Observation 2</strong>: <em>Conservative Estimates in Designers' Analysis</em>. For small primes, the designers' analysis significantly overestimates the number of rounds needed for security against the FW-GB w/ subspace attack. In contrast, for large primes (e.g., <em>p</em> ≈ 2 <sup>256</sup>), the estimates are very close to our results – though in some cases, they slightly underestimate the required number of rounds. This behavior is intuitive, as Poseidon was originally designed for large prime fields. In conclusion, while conservative round numbers strengthen security margins, they may negatively impact performance in small-field applications, where the overestimation is most pronounced.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Observation 3</strong>: <em>Impact of the Degree α of the S-Box</em>. To Study the effect of the S-Box degree <em>α</em>, we focus on the case <em>p</em> ≈ 2 <sup>256</sup>, where higher values of <em>α</em> are typically required (see <a href="#page-28-0">Figures 5d</a> to <a href="#page-28-0">5f\\)</a>. All subfigures use the same scale to allow direct comparison. We observe the following:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>The number of internal partial rounds required for security decreases as <em>α</em> increases, which is expected: higher-degree S-Boxes lead to faster degree growth, improving resistance to algebraic attacks.</li>

      <li>The number of rounds needed to resist the FW-GB w/ subspace attack is almost the same across all considered <em>α</em> ∈ {3<em>,</em> 6<em>,</em> 7}. Interestingly, for small <em>t</em>, a higher <em>α</em> slightly reduces the number of rounds needed. For large <em>t</em>, the effect of <em>α</em> is minimal, since the number of linearizable rounds (i.e., <em>t</em> − 2) dominates the attack's complexity.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We further note that the gap between the basic attack (e.g., univariate solving) and the FW-GB w/ subspace attack narrows as <em>α</em> increases. As a result, in scenarios where <em>p</em> − 1 is divisible by many small primes (i.e., higher <em>α</em> is necessary), the attack presented here could be decisive in determining the number of rounds needed to ensure the security of Poseidon/Poseidon2. <a href="#page-27-0">18</a></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span id="page-27-0"></span><sup>18</sup>For example, <em>p</em> = 2<sup>256</sup> + 1105635 satisfies that <em>p</em> − 1 is divisible by 3<em>,</em> 5<em>,</em> 7<em>,</em> 11 and 13. Hence, <em>α</em> = 17.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the following, we compare our theoretical predictions regarding the behavior of the Gröbner basis attack against Poseidon2 with our experimental results.

      <li>Positioning of the Subspace: Both GB and FGLM steps performed best when positioning the subspace trail in the middle of the internal rounds. While the Macaulay bound was minimized with  <span class="math">s = \\left \\lfloor \\frac{r_P \\ell}{2} \\right \\rfloor</span> , our experiments often showed that the smallest  <span class="math">d_{reg}</span>  was obtained using the ceiled version instead. To distinguish between these cases in Figure 6, we used filled markers for the first version and empty markers for the second. As expected, the choice of s had no effect on the dimension of the quotient space.</li>

      <li><em>GB Step</em>: The Macaulay bound consistently overestimates the degree of regularity, but its growth rate aligns well with the actual values. In particular, our experiments suggest that the theoretical bound and the computed d<sub>reg</sub> do not differ by more than a factor of 3.</li>

      <li>FGLM Step: The Bézout bound similarly overestimates the dimension of the quotient space. However, we were able to formulate a closed-form conjecture that precisely matches the experimental results presented in Tables 5b and 6b:</li>

    <p class="text-gray-300">• Computational Complexity: Assessing the relative hardness of the individual solving steps remains challenging. Empirically, the FGLM step requires more runtime than F4 in Magma, though both appear to scale similarly. When comparing estimated complexities, we observe the following relationship in our small-scale experiments:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">C_{\\text{FGLM}}(d_{\\mathcal{I}}, \\omega = 2) &lt; C_{\\text{GB}}(d_{\\text{reg}}, \\omega = 2) \\le C_{\\text{FGLM}}(d_{\\mathcal{I}}, \\omega = 3),</span>  (46)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{GB}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{FGLM}</span>  denote the complexity of the first and the second step in a Gröbner basis attack, respectively. This suggests that, for deriving round numbers, it is reasonable to focus on the complexity of the first step in the Gröbner basis attack.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, in Table 3, we compare the minimum round numbers necessary to guarantee security derived from the GB step (with the Macaulay bound) against those derived from the FGLM step (using our conjectured  <span class="math">d_{\\mathcal{I}}</span> ). The results are similar overall, though for smaller values of t, the FGLM-based approach tends to predict a higher number of secure rounds. We are currently not able to explain this fact, and we leave its analysis as an open problem for future work.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we provide concrete results for Neptune in sponge mode and perform practical experiments to support our arguments.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For Neptune over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> , we have  <span class="math">\\zeta=\\overline{\\zeta}=4</span>  due to the Lai-Massey construction in the external rounds,  <span class="math">\\alpha\\geq 3</span>  small and  <span class="math">\\overline{\\alpha}=\\alpha^{-1}</span>  large. Thus, unlike for Poseidon2, both algebraic models exploiting subspace trails can be applied efficiently, and we fix  <span class="math">\\ell=t-(c+d)=r-d</span>  to minimize the cost (i.e., linearize the maximum number of partial rounds). Further, we have  <span class="math">r_f&gt;r_f&#x27;</span> . In Section 8.2 we will see that the SitM strategy outperforms the FW strategy to attack Neptune in Sponge mode in all scenarios.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-41" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>8.2 Concrete Round Numbers</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The concrete numbers for Neptune in sponge mode are given in <a href="#page-33-0">Figure 7.</a> <a href="#page-32-2">20</a> In particular:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>The <strong>blue</strong>, <strong>green</strong>, and <strong>black</strong> lines represent the same strategies given before (cf. <a href="#page-26-0">Section 7.2\\)</a>;</li>

      <li>The <strong>orange</strong> line corresponds to the Start-in-the-Middle (SitM) GB attack exploiting subspace trails to linearize some internal partial rounds (see <a href="#page-22-2">Section 6.1\\)</a>. Similar to before, for <em>c</em> + <em>d</em> = 2, we compare the standard GB approach (full circles) with the resultant approach (empty circle) to solve the system in order to emphasize the different costs.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We recall that the designers did not provide an analysis of GB attacks exploiting subspace trails. Instead, they simply accounted for such attacks by adding <em>t</em> additional (partial) rounds.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As before, although no Neptune instance is broken by the considered algebraic attacks – whether or not internal rounds are linearized using subspace trails – these remain the strongest known approaches for finding preimages or collisions. Therefore, they are of critical importance in practical applications.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Observation 4</strong>: <em>Forward vs. SitM Attack</em>. As expected, the SitM-GB w/ subspace attack (in orange) outperforms the FW approach from <a href="#page-17-1">Section 5</a> in all cases. For larger <em>p</em>, the SitM approach additionally benefits from the smaller system it operates on and the applicability of the resultant technique.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Observation 5</strong>: <em>Basic Attacks vs. SitM Attack</em>. The relation between the basic attack (in blue) and the FW-GB w/ subspace attack (in green) is very similar to what we previously observed in <a href="#page-28-0">Figure 5.</a> Notably, for large primes <em>p</em> ≈ 2 <sup>256</sup> and <em>c</em> = <em>d</em> = 1 <a href="#page-33-0">\\(Figures 7d</a> to <a href="#page-33-0">7f\\)</a>, the basic attack – based on univariate solving – remains dominant. However, in the uncommon case where both <em>α</em> and <em>t</em> are large in this setting, the SitM attack becomes competitive, approaching the efficiency of the basic attack. This suggests that when a sufficiently large number of rounds can be linearized, the SitM strategy can even outperform univariate solving based attacks.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-42" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>8.3 Practical Verification</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the following, we compare our theoretical predictions regarding the behavior of the Gröbner basis attack against Neptune with our experimental results. We exemplarily use <a href="#page-34-0">Figures 8</a> and <a href="#page-35-1">9</a> to discuss our findings for the two approaches exploiting subspaces to linearize some partial rounds, i.e., the Forward (FW) and the Start-in-the-Middle (SitM) strategy presented in <a href="#page-20-0">Sections 5.3</a> and <a href="#page-23-0">6.2,</a> and refer to <a href="#page-47-0">Appendix C</a> for concrete numbers.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong><a href="#page-19-3">Model 1</a> (FW).</strong> Key observations are summarized below (see <a href="#page-50-0">Tables 7</a> and <a href="#page-51-0">8</a> for concrete numbers):</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li><em>Positioning of the Subspace</em>: The best performance for both GB and FGLM steps occurs when positioning the subspace trail in the middle of the internal rounds, as predicted.</li>

      <li><em>GB Step</em>: The Macaulay bound overestimates the degree of regularity. Notably, both the Macaulay bound and the degree of regularity exhibit similar growth patterns, forming a staircase-like structure. Specifically, two consecutive steps show the same value, followed by a jump upwards.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span id="page-32-2"></span><sup>20</sup>We recall that the security margin of Neptune only involves the partial internal rounds, and it does not affect the external full rounds.</p>

      <li>FGLM Step: The Bézout bound significantly overestimates the quotient space dimension.

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Model 2 (SitM).</strong> Key observations are summarized below (see Tables 9 and 10 for concrete numbers):</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">• Degree of the Backward Equations: While for  <span class="math">r_f \\in \\{1,2\\}</span> , the degree of the equations in the backward direction is  <span class="math">4^{r_f}</span> , we found that for  <span class="math">r_f = 4</span> , the degree is only  <span class="math">200 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^2</span>  instead of  <span class="math">256 = 4^4</span> . Note that we could not practically verify this observation for values of t larger than 4, as the Sage scripts did not finish. However, we expect the behavior to remain the same. Note that this influences the attack complexity described in Section 8.1 for these instances, in particular for larger values of t. For the round numbers presented in Section 8.2, only the case t0 with t1 is affected, resulting in the derived round number being one higher. See Figures 7a to 7c. We leave the problem to further investigate the degree and density of the (external round) equations open for future work.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li><span id="page-35-2"></span>• Regular Systems: For certain instances of Neptune, the equation system behaves regularly, with the Macaulay and Bézout bounds being tight, as shown in Figure Figure 9. However, this does not hold in general (see Table 9 in Appendix C).</li>

      <li>FGLM Step: For the quotient space dimension, we can identify the same pattern as before: for  <span class="math">r_F</span>  fixed, the dimension grows exponentially by a factor of 3 when increasing the number of partial rounds.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that with the SitM model, we were finally able to perform experiments for  <span class="math">r_F=6</span>  full rounds, as suggested by the designers. As before, it remains difficult to determine which step dominates the attack complexity. An in-depth analysis is left as an open problem for future work.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As we already pointed out in the introduction, in several works published in the literature, authors reduce the security of their proposed designs to the security against CICO problem (see, e.g., the security analysis of Poseidon/Poseidon2, Neptune, Anemoi, Griffin, and Monolith). For a concrete example, we recall the discussion of the CICO problem in the security analysis of the Poseidon2 compression function [GKS23, Sect. 7.2]:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">"[...] For the sponge mode using only a single permutation call, solving the CICO problem directly translates to a preimage attack on the sponge, and conversely, a preimage attack on the sponge mode is a solution to the CICO problem. Solving CICO is also sufficient to break the compression mode, but an attack on the compression</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>mode does not necessarily result in a solution to the CICO problem. Still, the CICO problem gives a good estimate of the strength of a cryptographic permutation, and of how much it deviates from a strong one.</em>"</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Indeed, security against the CICO problem is not sufficient to guarantee the security of a compression function. In particular, it is not possible <em>in general</em> to reduce the security of a compression function to the security against the CICO problem. To support this claim, we present a concrete example based on Neptune in compression mode.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Remark</em> 3<em>.</em> We emphasize that Neptune was originally proposed in sponge mode only [\\[GOPS22\\]](#page-41-3). However, there is no a priori reason why it could not be used in compression mode as well. The results of this section suggests that the security of Neptune in compression mode should be carefully analyzed, and it cannot be derived directly from the sponge case.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-44" class="text-2xl font-bold"><strong>9.1 Attack Complexity</strong></h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Assume the goal is to find a preimage of a certain value <em>h</em> ∈ F<em>p</em>. In compression mode, this corresponds to solving a system of <em>d</em> equations in <em>d</em> variables of degree</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Due to the possibility of linearizing up to <em>t</em> − <em>d</em> internal rounds of Neptune, it is possible to work with a system of <em>d</em> equations of degree</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Depending on <em>d</em>, the attacker can solve the resulting system of equations using: (i) univariate solving for <em>d</em> = 1, (ii) resultants for <em>d</em> = 2, and (iii) Gröbner bases for <em>d</em> ≥ 3.

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we revisit the attack from Section 6, now modeling the backward direction at round-level. This allows the approach to be applied even when the degree of the inverted rounds is high, as is the case for Poseidon/Poseidon2. To this end, recall that we denote the degree of an external round by  <span class="math">\\zeta</span>  and that of an internal round by  <span class="math">\\alpha</span> . The attacker can skip  <span class="math">1 \\le \\ell \\le t - (c+d)</span>  partial rounds using a subspace  <span class="math">\\mathcal{S}^{(\\ell)}</span>  of dimension  <span class="math">D = t - \\ell</span> , under the assumption that t > c + d.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that the complexity of this attack is, in general, <em>much higher</em> than the ones presented in <a href="#page-26-1">Section 7.1.</a> This is due to the higher number of equations that the attacker has to solve, which follows from the fact that the attacker has to work at round level in order to handle the initial full rounds in the backward direction.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-53" class="text-2xl font-bold"><strong>B.2 Attack on Poseidon2 (Poseidon) in Compression Mode</strong></h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The attack on Poseidon2 in compression mode works similarly to the one in sponge mode. The main difference relies on the fact that no constraint is imposed on the input of the hash (remember that this corresponds to <em>c</em> = 0), while such an input is added to the output of the hash. In more detail, assuming <em>s</em> = 0:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li><em>Backward part:</em> this part takes into account the initial external full rounds, and it is described by (<em>r<sup>f</sup></em> − 1) · <em>t</em> + <em>d</em> equations of degree <em>α</em>. With respect to the attack in <a href="#page-45-0">Appendix B.1,</a> no constraint is imposed on the input of the hash. Still, the attacker has to identify it in order to sum with the output of the hash;</li>

      <li><em>Middle part:</em> the middle part is described by linear equations only. Hence, the output of this middle part is defined via <em>t</em> linear equations;</li>

      <li><em>Forward part: d</em> equations of degree <em>α r<sup>f</sup></em> +<em>r<sup>P</sup></em> −(<em>r</em>−<em>d</em>) in order to satisfy the hash value conditions. We emphasize that the equations that describes this part are different from the ones in <a href="#page-45-0">Appendix B.1,</a> since an additional term corresponding to the input of the hash is summed here.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Overall, with respect to the attack presented in <a href="#page-45-0">Appendix B.1,</a> the number of equations is smaller, that is, (<em>r<sup>f</sup></em> − 1) · <em>t</em> + 2 · <em>d</em> instead of <em>r<sup>f</sup></em> · <em>t</em> + <em>d</em>. Still, the conclusion given in <a href="#page-45-0">Appendix B.1</a> regarding the prohibitive cost of the attack for concrete instances of Poseidon2 (and Poseidon) holds here as well. For this reason, we omit the details of the complexity cost of the attack.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-54" class="text-2xl font-bold"><strong>B.3 Attack on Neptune in Sponge Mode</strong></h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">By exploiting the same strategy proposed for Poseidon in <a href="#page-45-0">Appendix B.1,</a> we have to solve a system of equations defined as follows:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li><em>Backward part:</em> this part takes into account the initial external full rounds, and it is described by (<em>r<sup>f</sup></em> − 1) · <em>t</em> + <em>c</em> equations of degree 4 and <em>s</em> equations of degree <em>α</em>;</li>

      <li><em>Middle part:</em> the middle part is described by linear equations only. Hence, the output of this middle part is defined via <em>t</em> linear equations;</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is not hard to check that the best situation for the attacker occurs for <em>ℓ</em> = <em>t</em>−(<em>c</em>+<em>d</em>) = <em>r</em>−<em>d</em>. Indeed, note that <em>ℓ</em> does not impact the number of equations and the number of variables, but only the degree of the involved equations. Hence, it makes sense to maximize it.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As a result, we have (<em>r<sup>f</sup></em> −1)·<em>t</em>+<em>c</em>+<em>d</em>+<em>s</em> = <em>r<sup>f</sup></em> ·<em>t</em>+<em>s</em>+<em>d</em>−<em>r</em> equations in (<em>r<sup>f</sup></em> −1)·<em>t</em>+<em>c</em>+<em>d</em>+<em>s</em> = <em>r<sup>f</sup></em> · <em>t</em> + <em>d</em> + <em>s</em> − <em>r</em> variables.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Under the usual assumptions (see <a href="#page-13-1">Assumption 1\\)</a>, the cost of the attack against Neptune is given by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We conducted practical experiments to verify the described GB attacks with linearization of some internal rounds. We focused on <em>α</em> = 3 due to system size limitations in Magma. Experiments covered up to 5 internal rounds.</p>

      <li>For the GB step, we report the Macaulay bound, the maximum degree in the drl Gröbner basis, the degree of regularity, as well as the solving degree (timing-based) as defined in <a href="#page-12-0">Section 3.3.</a></li>

      <li>For the FGLM step, we provide the Bézout bound, the quotient space dimension (logged by Magma), and the number of solutions over F<em>p</em>.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that some cells contain two values (the right one in braces), corresponding to different choices for the subspace trail starting round. The left value uses <em>s</em> = <em>r<sup>P</sup></em> −<em>ℓ</em> 2 , and the right value <em>s</em> = <em>r<sup>P</sup></em> −<em>ℓ</em> 2 , if different.</p>

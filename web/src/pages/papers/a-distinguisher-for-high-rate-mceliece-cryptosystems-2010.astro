    <p class="text-gray-300">The Goppa Code Distinguishing (GD) problem consists in distinguishing the matrix of a Goppa code from a random matrix. The hardness of this problem is an assumption to prove the security of code-based cryptographic primitives such as McEliece's cryptosystem. Up to now, it is widely believed that the GD problem is a hard decision problem. We present the first method allowing to distinguish alternant and Goppa codes over any field. Our technique can solve the GD problem in polynomial-time provided that the codes have sufficiently large rates. The key ingredient is an algebraic characterization of the key-recovery problem. The idea is to consider the rank of a linear system which is obtained by linearizing a particular polynomial system describing a key-recovery attack. It appears that this dimension depends on the type of code considered. Explicit formulas derived from extensive experimentations for the rank are provided for &quot;generic&quot; random, alternant, and Goppa codes over any field. Finally, we give theoretical explanations of these formulas in the case of random codes, alternant codes over any field of characteristic two and binary Goppa codes.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-4" class="text-2xl font-bold">I. INTRODUCTION</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">T HIS paper&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; investigates the difficulty of the Goppa Code Distinguishing (GD) problem which first appeared in [2]. This is a decision problem that aims at recognizing a generator matrix of a binary Goppa code from a randomly drawn binary matrix. Up to now, it is assumed that no polynomial time algorithm exists that distinguishes a generator matrix of a Goppa code from a randomly picked generator matrix.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The main motivation for introducing the GD problem is to formally relate the problem of decoding a random linear code to the security of the McEliece public-key cryptosytem [3]. Since its apparition, this cryptosystem has withstood many attacks and after more than thirty years now, it still belongs to the very few unbroken public key cryptosystems. This situation substantiates the claim that inverting the encryption function, and in particular recovering the private key from public data, is intractable. The classical methods for inverting the McEliece encryption function without finding a trapdoor all resort to the use of the best general decoding algorithms [4]–[11]. All these algorithms, whose time complexity is exponential (in the length), attempt to solve the long-standing problem of decoding random linear code [12]. They also assume (implicitly or explicitly) that there does not exist an algorithm that is able to decode more efficiently McEliece public keys. Note that if ever such an algorithm exists, it would permit to solve the GD problem.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">On the other hand, no significant breakthrough has been observed with respect to the problem of recovering the private key [13], [14]. This has led to state that the generator matrix of a binary Goppa code does not disclose any visible structure that an attacker could exploit. This is strengthened by the fact that Goppa codes share many characteristics with random codes. For instance they asymptotically meet the Gilbert-Varshamov bound. They also have a trivial permutation group, <em>etc.</em> Hence, the hardness of the GD problem has become a classical belief, and as a consequence, a <em>de facto</em> assumption to prove the semantic security in the standard model (IND-CPA in [15] and IND-CCA2 in [16]), and the security in the random oracle model against existential forgery [2], [17] of the signature scheme [2].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We present a deterministic polynomial-time distinguisher for codes whose rate is close to 1. This includes in particular codes encountered with the signature scheme CFS ( [2], [18]). We emphasize that our method can distinguish codes also used in McEliece's encryption scheme. For instance, the binary Goppa code obtained with m = 13 and r = 19 corresponding to a 90-bit security key is distinguishable. We provide an asymptotic formula for the smallest rate Rcrit for which one can</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A preliminary version [1] of this paper has been presented in IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2011), Paraty, Brazil, Oct. 16-20 2011.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">distinguish a q-random code from a q-ary alternant or Goppa code (Theorem 3). If q is fixed and assuming that the length is  <span class="math">q^m</span>  then when m tends to infinity, we have:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$R_{\\text{crit}} = 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{2 m \\log q}{q^m \\log m}} (1 + o(1)).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where all logarithms are taken to base 2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our distinguisher is based on the algebraic attack developed against compact variants of McEliece [19]. In this approach, the key-recovery problem is transformed into the one of solving an algebraic system. By using a linearization technique, we are able to derive a linear system whose rank is different from what one would expect in the random case. More precisely, we observe experimentally that this defect in the rank is directly related to the type of codes. We provide explicit formulas for &quot;generic&quot; random, alternant, and Goppa codes over any alphabet. We performed extensive experiments to confirm that the formulas are accurate. Eventually, we prove the formula in the random case and give explanations in the case of alternant codes over any field of characteristic two and binary Goppa codes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, the existence of our distinguisher does not undermine the security of primitives based on Goppa codes, but basically, it proves that the GD assumption is false for some parameters, and consequently should be used with great care as an assumption for a security reduction.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The paper is organized as follows. After recalling basic notions in coding-theory in Section II, we introduce in Section III our algebraic distinguisher which is basically the dimension of the solution space of a linear system that is deduced by linearization from the algebraic system that any McEliece cryptosystem must satisfy. We then provide explicit formulas that predicts the behavior of the distinguisher coming from experiments. In Section IV and Section V, we give explanations of the formulas for alternant and binary Goppa codes. In Section VI, we give a proof of its typical behavior in the random case. Lastly, we conclude over the cryptographic implications the distinguisher induces and we deduce an asymptotic formula for the smallest rate for which we can distinguish a random code from an alternant code or a Goppa code.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-5" class="text-2xl font-bold">II. CODE-BASED PUBLIC-KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The problem of decoding random linear codes is a potential candidate for building public-key cryptographic primitives such as an encryption scheme. McEliece [3] was the first to use this problem in public-key cryptography. The idea is to start from afamily of codes equipped with a polynomial-time decoding algorithm. The fundamental concept of is to consider two equivalent representations of a code: one should facilitate the decoding, whereas the decoding should be infeasible from the other one. Although his design principle is general, he explicitly advocated to use binary Goppa codes [20].</p>

    <h2 id="sec-6" class="text-2xl font-bold">A. Coding Theory Background</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Code-based public-key cryptography focuses on linear codes that have a polynomial time decoding algorithm. We recall that a q-ary (linear)  <span class="math">code \\mathscr{C}</span>  over the finite field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  of q elements defined by a  <span class="math">k \\times n</span>  matrix G (with  <span class="math">k \\leqslant n</span> ) whose entries belong to  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  is the vector space spanned by its rows i.e.,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathscr{C} \\stackrel{\\mathsf{def}}{=} \\Big\\{ \\boldsymbol{u} \\boldsymbol{G} \\mid \\boldsymbol{u} \\in \\mathbb{F}_q^k \\Big\\}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The length of  <span class="math">\\mathscr{C}</span>  is n and its rate is the ratio  <span class="math">R \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} k/n</span> . The role of decoding algorithms is to correct errors of prescribed weight. We say that a decoding algorithm corrects r errors if it recovers u from the knowledge of uG + e for all possible  <span class="math">e \\in \\mathbb{F}_q^n</span>  of weight at most r.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One famous family of codes is the one of binary Goppa codes. It belongs to the more general class of alternant codes ([21, Chap. 12, p. 365]). The main well-known feature of an alternant code is the possibility of being decoded in polynomial time. It is more convenient to describe this class through a parity-check matrix over an extension field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^m}</span>  of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  over which the code is defined. We recall that a parity-check matrix H of a q-ary code  <span class="math">\\mathscr C</span>  is defined as a matrix such that:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathscr{C} \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=} \\Big\\{ \\boldsymbol{c} \\in \\mathbb{F}_q^n \\mid \\boldsymbol{H} \\boldsymbol{c}^T = \\boldsymbol{0} \\Big\\}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where the symbol T means the transpose operation. For q-ary alternant codes of length  <span class="math">n \\leq q^m</span> , there exists a parity-check matrix with a very special form related to rectangular Vandermonde matrices:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\boldsymbol{V}_r(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{y}) \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} y_1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; y_n \\ y_1x_1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; y_nx_n \\ \\vdots &amp; &amp; \\vdots \\ y_1x_1^{r-1} &amp; \\cdots &amp; y_nx_n^{r-1} \\end{array} \\right)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">\\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)</span>  and  <span class="math">\\boldsymbol{y}=(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)</span>  are in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^m}^n</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Definition 1 (Alternant code): A q-ary alternant code of order r associated to  <span class="math">\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, \\dots, x_n) \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q^m}^n</span>  where all  <span class="math">x_i</span> 's are distinct and  <span class="math">y = (y_1, \\dots, y_n) \\in (\\mathbb{F}_{q^m}^*)^n</span>  denoted by  <span class="math">\\mathscr{A}_r(x, y)</span>  is</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\Big\\{\\boldsymbol{c} \\in \\mathbb{F}_q^n \\mid \\boldsymbol{V}_r(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{y}) \\boldsymbol{c}^T = \\boldsymbol{0}\\Big\\}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is well-known that the dimension k of an alternant codes of degree r satisfies  <span class="math">k \\ge n - rm</span> . Moreover, a key feature about them is the following property.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proposition 1: An alternant codes of degree r can decode in polynomial time all errors of weight at most  <span class="math">\\frac{r}{2}</span>  whenever there exists a parity-check matrix in the form  <span class="math">V_r(x^*, y^*)</span>  for some vectors  <span class="math">x^*</span>  and  <span class="math">y^*</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Definition 2 (Goppa codes): A q-ary Goppa code  <span class="math">\\mathscr{G}(\\boldsymbol{x},\\gamma)</span>  associated to a polynomial  <span class="math">\\gamma(z) \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} \\sum_{i=0}^r \\gamma_i x^i</span>  of degree r over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^m}</span>  and an n-tuple  <span class="math">\\boldsymbol{x} = (x_1,\\dots,x_n)</span>  of distinct elements of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^m}</span>  satisfying  <span class="math">\\gamma(x_i) \\neq 0</span>  for all  <span class="math">i,1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n</span> , is the q-ary</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">alternant code  <span class="math">\\mathscr{A}_r(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{y})</span>  of order r with  <span class="math">y_i = \\gamma(x_i)^{-1}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Goppa codes, viewed as alternant codes, inherit a decoding algorithm that corrects up to  <span class="math">\\frac{r}{2}</span>  errors. But in the case of binary Goppa codes, it is possible to correct twice as many errors. The starting point is the following result given in [21, p. 341].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Theorem 1: A binary Goppa code  <span class="math">\\mathscr{G}(x,\\gamma)</span>  associated to a Goppa polynomial  <span class="math">\\gamma(z)</span>  of degree r without multiple roots is equal to the alternant code  <span class="math">\\mathscr{A}_{2r}(\\boldsymbol{x},\\boldsymbol{y})</span>  with  <span class="math">y_i = \\gamma(x_i)^{-2}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Corollary 1 ([22]): There exists a polynomial time algorithm decoding all errors of weight at most r for any Goppa code  <span class="math">\\mathscr{G}(\\boldsymbol{x},\\gamma)</span>  where  <span class="math">\\gamma(z)</span>  is of degree r and has no multiple roots.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is worthwhile recalling that the only requirement for decoding a binary Goppa  <span class="math">\\mathscr{G}</span>  is either to know x and  <span class="math">\\gamma(z)</span>  or to know two vectors  <span class="math">x^*</span>  and  <span class="math">y^*</span>  such that:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathscr{G} = \\mathscr{A}_{2r}(\\boldsymbol{x}^*, \\boldsymbol{y}^*). \\tag{1}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The two most important public schemes that use binary Goppa codes are McEliece's encryption function and Courtois-Finiasz-Sendrier (CFS) [2] signature algorithm. We briefly recall here the general principle of McEliece's scheme. The key generation algorithm picks at random one  <span class="math">k \\times n</span>  generator matrix G of a randomly picked binary Goppa code of  <span class="math">\\mathscr{G}</span>  of degree r. The <em>secret</em> key is the decoding algorithm  <span class="math">\\mathcal D</span>  associated to  <span class="math">\\mathscr G</span>  and the <em>public</em> key is G. To encrypt  <span class="math">u\\in \\mathbb F_2^k</span> , the sender has to choose a random vector e in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2^n</span>  of weight r and computes the ciphertext  <span class="math">c \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} uG + e</span> . The receiver then recovers the plaintext by applying  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}</span>  on c.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The CFS scheme also relies on binary Goppa codes. A user whose public key is G and who wishes to sign a message  <span class="math">x \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^k</span>  has to compute a string u such that the Hamming weight of x - uG is at most r. Anyone (a verifier) can publicly check the validity of a signature. Unfortunately, this approach can only provide signatures for messages x that are within distance r from a codeword uG. The CFS scheme prompts to modify the message by appending a counter incremented until the decoding algorithm can find such a signature. The efficiency of this scheme heavily depends on the number of trials. With a binary Goppa codes of length  <span class="math">n=2^m</span>  and and dimension k=n-mr, the number of trials is of order r!. So one has to choose a very small r and therefore take a very large n in order to be secure. The code rate is then equal to  <span class="math">1-\\frac{1}{2m}mr</span> which is quite close to 1 for large n (that is for large values of m) and moderate values of r. For instance, a 80-bit security CFS scheme requires to take  <span class="math">n=2^{21}</span>  and r=10 whereas the McEliece cryptosystem for the same security needs to choose  <span class="math">n=2^{11}</span>  and r=32 ([18]). Thus one major difference between the McEliece cryptosystem and the CFS scheme lies in the choice of the parameters of the codes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The minimum requirement for an encryption function is that it should be infeasible from a given ciphertext c and public  <span class="math">data^2</span>  like the public key, ciphertexts, etc. to recover the corresponding plaintext x. This issue is directly linked to the following computational problem.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Definition 3 (McEliece Problem): Let G be a generator matrix of a binary Goppa code of length  <span class="math">n \\leqslant 2^m</span>  and dimension k=n-rm where m and t are positive integers. Let x be a vector from  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^m}^k</span>  and let e be a vector from  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^m}^n</span>  of weight t. Finally, we set  <span class="math">c \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} xG + e</span> . Then the <em>McEliece Problem</em> asks to find x and e only from G and e.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One obvious way of solving this problem consists in devising a method that recovers the private key. But, it is also possible to recover a plaintext from a specific ciphertext without resorting to a key-recovery attack. In particular, an attacker against the McEliece scheme would find the plaintext by applying general decoding methods like [3]-[11], [23]-[27] on the public matrix G. Such attacks are called decoding attacks. It is possible  <span class="math">\\mathcal{G}_{n,k}</span>  to precise formally all these notions. For any integers n and k with  <span class="math">k \\leq n</span> , we denote by  <span class="math">\\mathcal{G}_{n,k}</span>  the set of  <span class="math">k \\times n</span>  generator matrices of binary Goppa codes. Similarly,  <span class="math">\\mathcal{R}_{n,k}</span>  is the set of binary random generator  <span class="math">k \\times n</span>  matrices. The set of words of weight t is denoted by  <span class="math">\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{0},t)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&lt;sup&gt;&amp;&lt;/sup&gt;lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;This kind of attack is called a <em>Chosen Plaintext Attack</em> (CPA).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Definition 4: An  <span class="math">(T, \\varepsilon)</span> -adversary  <span class="math">\\mathbb A</span>  against the McEliece cryptosystem is an algorithm that runs in time at most T such that:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where the random choices are made such that  <span class="math">G \\in \\mathcal{G}_{n,k}</span> ,  <span class="math">m \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^k</span>  and  <span class="math">e \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{0},t)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">An algorithm  <span class="math">\\mathbb{A}</span>  is a  <span class="math">(T, \\varepsilon)</span> -decoder if it runs in time at most T such that:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Currently, the only known methods that aim to solve the McEliece problem are based either on an exhaustive search of the private key or on applying very general decoding methods. Both approaches run in exponential time on the length when the rate is fixed. But this situation is a still unsatisfactory because there is no certitude that there does not exist a better way to solve it.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A classical stance is to claim that binary Goppa codes look like random linear codes. It amounts to say that there does not exist a polynomial-time computable quantity which behaves differently depending on whether the code is a Goppa or a random code. Currently, it is an open problem to establish a formal proof that would substantiate the claim that a binary Goppa code is <em>indistinguishable</em> from a random code. This assumption is attractive because it enables to rely on the hardness of decoding a random linear code to prove the security of the McEliece function. This reasoning does make sense because binary Goppa codes share several common aspects&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with a randomly picked linear code. Furthermore, all the general decoding algorithms do not exploit the information, even partially, that a matrix describes a &quot;hidden&quot; Goppa code. Based on this, the authors of [2] defined the <em>Goppa Code Distinguishing (GD) problem</em> and stated that &quot;classification issues are in the core of coding theory since its emergence in the 50's. So far nothing significant is known about Goppa codes, more precisely there is no known property invariant by permutation and computable in polynomial time which characterizes Goppa codes. Finding such a property or proving that none exists would be an important breakthrough in coding theory and would also probably seal the fate, for good or ill, of Goppa code-based cryptosystems&quot;. We state now precisely the GD problem.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\operatorname{Adv}(\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathbb{A}}) = \\Big|\\operatorname{Suc}_{\\mathsf{Rand}}(\\mathbb{A}) - \\operatorname{Suc}_{\\mathsf{McE}}(\\mathbb{A})\\Big|.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This shows that if  <span class="math">Adv(\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathbb{A}}</span>  is very small (or negligible) then the chances that an attacker recovers a plaintext are also very small provided that the problem of decoding a random linear code is hard. So the difficulty of the GD problem guarantees that there is no polynomial-time algorithm that solves the McEliece problem.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Until our recent work in [1] and this paper, the only known algorithm for solving GD enumerates binary Goppa codes and tests the code equivalence thanks to the <em>Support Splitting</em> algorithm [29]. This approach runs in time  <span class="math">O\\left(\\frac{1}{mr}n^{r-1}\\right)</span>  for binary Goppa codes of degree r and length n with  <span class="math">m \\le \\log_2 n</span> . Another possible approach was proposed in [30] which shows that Quantum Fourier Sampling (QFS) can also be used for solving the GD problem. However, it turns out that QFS has a negligible advantage against the GD problem. Thus GD problem seems immune against QFS unlike classical cryptographic problems such as factoring integers and discrete logarithms which can be solved in (quantum) poly-time thanks to QFS [31]. This does not contradict the existence of a (classical) poly-time algorithm solving GD. In this paper, we show how to exploit the algebraic structure of Goppa codes to construct a classical poly-time distinguisher with optimal advantage under some conditions on the rate of the code.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&lt;sup&gt;&amp;&lt;/sup&gt;lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Similarly to random codes, Goppa codes asymptotically meet the Gilbert-Varshamov bound. They have also a trivial permutation group like random codes.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-7" class="text-2xl font-bold">D. Semantically Secure Conversions</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The fundamental issue when dealing with cryptographic primitives is to prove its security. A first approach is to show that the primitive resists to the best known attacks. However, this does not guarantee that there will not appear one day a better attack that renders the primitive insecure. The methodology of <em>security proof by reduction</em> addresses this question by linking a security notion that a cryptographic primitive should verify to an algorithmic problem widely considered as hard. The approach is similar to the one that proves the NP-Completeness of a given problem. Such a &quot;security proof&quot; proves that if an attacker exists then it can be used as a subroutine to solve a hard problem. In other words, such an attacker has little chances to exist.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">These simple facts prompt to design conversions that would lead to an IND-CCA secure encryption scheme. The first article to propose such a conversion for the McEliece cryptosystem is [32] which proposes a conversion resulting into an IND-CCA2 in the <em>Random Oracle Model</em> under the assumption that the problem of decoding random linear codes is difficult. This work was then followed by [33] which proposes another modification while providing an IND-CPA secure encryption scheme in the standard model&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; under the assumptions that both decoding random linear codes <em>and</em> distinguishing Goppa codes are difficult problems. Finally, under the same assumptions, [34] proposed (a modified) McEliece cryptosystem that is IND-CCA2 in the <em>standard model</em>.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-8" class="text-2xl font-bold">III. A DISTINGUISHER OF ALTERNANT AND GOPPA CODES</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The McEliece cryptosystem relies on binary Goppa codes which belong to the class of alternant codes. We are now able to construct an algebraic system as explained in [19] for a key-recovey. This algebraic system will be the main ingredient for building a distinguisher. We assume that the public matrix is a  <span class="math">k \\times n</span>  generator matrix G where by assumption k = n - rm and such that it defines an alternant code of degree r. We know that the knowledge of a matrix  <span class="math">V_r(x^*, y^*)</span>  for some vectors  <span class="math">x^*</span>  and  <span class="math">y^*</span>  allows to efficiently decode the public code defined by G. Furthermore, from the definition of G, we also know:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\boldsymbol{V}_r(\\boldsymbol{x}^*, \\boldsymbol{y}^*)\\boldsymbol{G}^T = \\boldsymbol{0}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">X_1, \\ldots, X_n</span>  and  <span class="math">Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n</span>  be 2n variables corresponding to the  <span class="math">x_i^*</span> 's and the  <span class="math">y_i^*</span> 's. Observe that such  <span class="math">x_i^*</span> 's and  <span class="math">y_i^*</span> 's are a particular solution [19] of the following polynomial system:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\bigcup_{e=0}^{r-1} \\left\\{ \\sum_{j=1}^{n} g_{i,j} Y_j X_j^e = 0 \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant k \\right\\}</span>$
(2)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where the  <span class="math">g_{i,j}</span> 's are the entries of the known matrix G. Clearly, solving this system would lead to a possibly equivalent private key. For compact variants [35], [36] of McEliece [3], additional structures permit to drastically reduce the number of variables allowing to solve (2) for a large set of parameters in polynomial-time using dedicated Gröbner bases techniques [19]. But the general case is currently a major open question. However, we describe a simple way for partially solving (2). It basically consists in deriving a linear system from the polynomial system (2). Note that this operation is actually the first step performed during the computation of Gröbner bases algorithms such as by  <span class="math">F_4</span>  or  <span class="math">F_5</span>  [37], [38]. From now on, we will always assume that  <span class="math">q=2^s</span>  with  <span class="math">s\\geqslant 1</span> . We can assume that  <span class="math">G=(g_{ij})</span>  with  <span class="math">1\\leqslant i\\leqslant k</span>  and  <span class="math">1\\leqslant j\\leqslant n</span>  is in reduced row echelon form over its k first positions  <span class="math">G=(I_k\\mid P)</span>  where  <span class="math">P=(p_{ij})</span>  for  <span class="math">1\\leqslant i\\leqslant k</span>  and  <span class="math">k+1\\leqslant j\\leqslant n</span>  is the submatrix of G formed by its last n-k=mr columns. Next, for any  <span class="math">i\\in \\{1,\\ldots,k\\}</span>  and  <span class="math">e\\in \\{0,\\ldots,r-1\\}</span> , we can rewrite (2) as  <span class="math">Y_iX_i^e=\\sum_{j=k+1}^n p_{i,j}Y_jX_j^e</span> . Then, thanks to the trivial identity  <span class="math">Y_i(Y_iX_i^2)=(Y_iX_i)^2</span>  for all i in  <span class="math">\\{1,\\ldots,k\\}</span> , we get:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\sum_{j=k+1}^{n} p_{i,j} Y_j \\sum_{j=k+1}^{n} p_{i,j} Y_j X_j^2 = \\left(\\sum_{j=k+1}^{n} p_{i,j} Y_j X_j\\right)^2.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We thus obtain a linear system  <span class="math">\\mathcal{L}_{P}</span>  of k equations involving  <span class="math">\\binom{mr}{2}</span>  variables  <span class="math">Z_{jj&#x27;} \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} Y_j Y_{j&#x27;} X_{j&#x27;}^2 + Y_{j&#x27;} Y_j X_j^2</span>  which is as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathcal{L}_{P} \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} \\begin{cases} \\sum_{j=k+1}^{n-1} \\sum_{j&#x27;&gt;j}^{n} p_{1,j} p_{i,j&#x27;} Z_{jj&#x27;} = 0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\sum_{j=k+1}^{n-1} \\sum_{j&#x27;&gt;j}^{n} p_{k,j} p_{i,j&#x27;} Z_{jj&#x27;} = 0 \\end{cases}</span>$

    <p class="text-gray-300">Definition 6: For any integer  <span class="math">r \\geqslant 1</span>  and  <span class="math">m \\geqslant 1</span> , the number of variables  <span class="math">\\binom{mr}{2}</span>  in the linear system  <span class="math">\\mathcal{L}_{P}</span>  as defined in (3) is denoted by N and its rank by  <span class="math">\\mathrm{rank}(\\mathcal{L}_{P})</span> . We denote by  <span class="math">\\mathrm{Ker}(\\mathcal{L}_{P})</span>  the kernel of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{L}_{P}</span>  and its dimension as a  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span> -vector space is denoted by D.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&lt;sup&gt;&amp;&lt;/sup&gt;lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;There is no hash function in this model.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let us recall that  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Ker}(\\mathcal{L}_P)</span>  is necessarily a  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> -vector space since the linear system (3) have coefficients in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  but the solutions of (2) are sought in the extension field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^m}</span> . Furthermore, we obviously have  <span class="math">D=N-\\operatorname{rank}(\\mathcal{L}_P)</span> . Hence, in order to recover the solutions of (2), it is necessary that  <span class="math">\\operatorname{rank}(\\mathcal{L}_P)</span>  is almost equal to the number of variables  <span class="math">N=\\binom{mr}{2}</span> . For a random system, this is likely to happen when the number k of equations in (3) is greater than the number of unknowns, that is to say  <span class="math">k \\geqslant N</span> . It appears experimentally that D is amazingly large even in the case where  <span class="math">k \\geqslant N</span> . It even depends on whether or not the code with generator matrix G is chosen as a (generic) alternant code or as a Goppa code. Interestingly enough, when G is chosen at random,  <span class="math">\\operatorname{rank}(\\mathcal{L}_P)</span>  is equal to  <span class="math">\\min\\{k,N\\}</span>  with very high probability. In particular, the dimension of the solution space is typically 0 when k is larger than the number of variables N as one would expect. This will be proved in Section VI. Although this defect in the rank is an obstacle to break the McEliece cryptosystem, it can be used to distinguish the public generator of a structured code from a random code.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We consider three cases. First, when the  <span class="math">p_{ij}</span> 's are chosen uniformly and independently at random in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  then we denote by  <span class="math">D_{\\text{random}}</span>  the dimension of  <span class="math">\\text{Ker}(\\mathcal{L}_P)</span> . When G is chosen as a generator matrix of a random alternant (resp. Goppa) code of degree r, we denote it by  <span class="math">D_{\\text{alternant}}</span>  (resp.  <span class="math">D_{\\text{Goppa}}</span> ). We carried out intensive computations with Magma [39] by randomly generating alternant and Goppa codes over the field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  with  <span class="math">q \\in \\{2,4,8,16,32\\}</span>  for r in the range  <span class="math">\\{3,\\ldots,50\\}</span>  and several values of m. Furthermore, in our probabilistic model, a random alternant code is obtained by picking uniformly and independently at random two vectors  <span class="math">(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)</span>  and  <span class="math">(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)</span>  from  <span class="math">(\\mathbb{F}_{q^m})^n</span>  such that the  <span class="math">x_i</span> 's are all different and the  <span class="math">y_i</span> 's are all nonzero. A random Goppa code is obtained by taking a random vector  <span class="math">(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)</span>  in  <span class="math">(\\mathbb{F}_{q^m})^n</span>  with all the  <span class="math">x_i</span> 's different and a random irreducible polynomial  <span class="math">\\gamma(z) = \\sum_i \\gamma_i z^i</span>  of degree r.

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we will investigate the case of binary Goppa codes. Notice that for q-ary Goppa codes of degree r &lt; q - 1 we have observed that  <span class="math">T_{\\text{alternant}} = T_{\\text{Goppa}}</span>  because (4) simplifies to:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\frac{1}{2}m(r-1)(r-2) \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} T_{\\text{Goppa}}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This is due to the fact that e = 0 when r &lt; q - 1. We leave as an open question the proof that q-ary Goppa codes of degree r &lt; q - 1 behave for our distinguisher as alternant codes. We focus on the classical case in code-based cryptography of binary Goppa codes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The goal is to identify a basis of  <span class="math">Ker(\\mathcal{L}_{P})</span>  for binary Goppa codes of degree r. We assume therefore that q=2. In that special case, the theoretical expression  <span class="math">T_{\\text{Goppa}}</span>  (Experimental Fact 2) has a simpler expression.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proposition 3: Let  <span class="math">e = \\lceil \\log_2 r \\rceil + 1</span> . When q = 2 then (6) can be simplified to:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$T_{\\text{Goppa}} = \\frac{1}{2} mr \\Big( (2e+1)r - 2^e - 1 \\Big).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Theorem 1 shows that a binary Goppa code of degree r can be regarded as a binary alternant code of degree 2r. This seems to indicate that we should have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$D_{\\text{Goppa}}(r) = T_{\\text{alternant}}(2r).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This is not the case though because it turns out that  <span class="math">D_{\\text{Goppa}}(r)</span>  is significantly smaller than this. In our experiments, we have found out that the vectors of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{2r}</span>  still form a generating set for  <span class="math">\\text{Ker}(\\mathcal{L}_P)</span> . Unfortunately, they are not independent anymore. Our goal is therefore to identify the additional dependencies occurring in  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{2r}</span> . We will see that many of them come from  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^m}</span> -relations induced by the Goppa polynomial  <span class="math">\\gamma(z) = \\sum_{i=0}^r \\gamma_i z^i</span>  with  <span class="math">\\gamma_r \\neq 0</span> . Recall that by definition  <span class="math">Y_i = \\gamma(X_i)^{-2}</span> . This fact will allow to derive two types of linear dependencies. The first type of linear relations is rather natural, whilst the second type is more subtle. In the sequel we set  <span class="math">u \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} |\\log_2(2r-1)|</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We derive a first set of linear dependencies induced by the Goppa polynomial  <span class="math">\\gamma(X)</span> . Proposition 4: Let  <span class="math">t, \\ell</span>  and c be such that  <span class="math">0 \\le t \\le r-2</span> ,  <span class="math">1 \\le \\ell \\le u</span>  and  <span class="math">0 \\le c \\le 2r-2^{\\ell}-1</span>  then it holds:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\sum_{b=0}^{r} \\gamma_b^{2^{\\ell}} B(t+b,c,\\ell) = B(2t,c+2^{\\ell-1},\\ell-1) + B(2t+1,c,\\ell-1).</span>$
(11)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof:</em> Let us set  <span class="math">V = (V_{i,j&#x27;})_{(i,j&#x27;) \\in J}</span>  as the following:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The equality  <span class="math">Y_j\\gamma(X_j)^2=1</span>  clearly implies that  <span class="math">\\sum_{b=0}^r\\gamma_b^2Y_j^2X_j^{2(b+t)}=Y_jX_j^{2t}</span>  and therefore:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$V_{j,j&#x27;} = \\left(X_j + X_{j&#x27;}\\right)^{2^{\\ell}} \\left(Y_j Y_{j&#x27;}^{2^{\\ell-1}} X_j^c X_{j&#x27;}^{2^{\\ell}t} + Y_{j&#x27;} Y_j^{2^{\\ell-1}} X_{j&#x27;}^c X_j^{2^{\\ell}t}\\right).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One can check that V is exactly the vector that we would obtain from the identity  <span class="math">a^* + 2^{\\ell-1}b^* = c + 2^{\\ell-1}(b^* + 2)</span>  with  <span class="math">a^* \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} c + 2^{\\ell}</span>  and  <span class="math">b^* \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} 2t</span> . Hence by (10) the vector V can be written as:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$V = B(2t, c + 2^{\\ell-1}, \\ell - 1) + B(2t + 1, c, \\ell - 1).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This last equality terminates the proof.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Consequently  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{2r}</span>  cannot provide a basis for  <span class="math">\\text{Ker}(\\mathcal{L}_{P})</span>  as in the alternant case. It even possible to count the number of linear dependencies predicted by Proposition 4. Indeed, each equation is defined by a <em>unique</em>  <span class="math">(t, c, \\ell)</span>  such that  <span class="math">0 \\le t \\le r-2, 1 \\le \\ell \\le u</span>  and  <span class="math">0 \\le c \\le 2r-2^{\\ell}-1</span> . So if  <span class="math">N_L</span>  is the number of equations of the form (11) then clearly we have:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$N_L = 2(r-1)(ru+1-2^u). (12)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We exhibit new linear dependencies between some elements of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{2r}</span>  and the vectors  <span class="math">\\mathbf{B}^2(b,c,\\ell)</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">We recognize that V is exactly the expression of  <span class="math">B(b, 2t, \\ell + 1)</span>  and hence the proposition is proved.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We can count the number of linearly dependencies predicted by Proposition 5.

    <p class="text-gray-300">We now want to count the number of linear dependencies induced by Proposition 5 and Proposition 4. The difficulty is that some of the  <span class="math">N_Q</span>  vectors of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{2r}</span>  are counted twice because they appear both in linear relations of the form (11) and &quot;quadratic&quot; equations of the form (13). Let  <span class="math">N_{L\\cap Q}</span>  be the number of such vectors. More precisely, let  <span class="math">\\mathcal{Q}_{2r}</span>  be the subset of vectors  <span class="math">\\mathbf{B}(b,c,\\ell)</span>  of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{2r}</span>  which are involved in an Equation of type (13). Remark in that case c has to be even and  <span class="math">\\ell \\geqslant 1</span> . Furthermore, there are equations of type (11) which involve only vectors of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{Q}_{2r}</span> . Let  <span class="math">N_1</span>  be their number. Moreover, it is possible by adding two equations of type (11) involving at least one vector which is not in  <span class="math">\\mathcal{Q}_{2r}</span>  to obtain an equation which involves only vectors of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{Q}_{2r}</span> . Let  <span class="math">N_0</span>  be the number of such sums and let  <span class="math">N_{L\\cap Q} \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} N_1 + N_0</span> . Our goal is to prove that:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$N_{L\\cap Q} = (r-1)\\Big((u-\\frac{1}{2})r - 2^u + 2\\Big). \\tag{16}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof:</em> We will consider vectors of  <span class="math">Q_{2r}</span> , that is to say vectors of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}_{2r}</span>  that satisfy Equation (13), such that there exists a linear relation that link them. In other words, we consider all the linear relations of the form:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\sum_{i} \\alpha_i \\mathbf{B}(b_i, c_i, \\ell_i) = 0</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">with  <span class="math">\\alpha_i</span>  in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^m}</span>  and where each  <span class="math">B(b_i, c_i, \\ell_i)</span>  is equal to a linear relation of the form (13).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One can observe that for such vectors we necessarily have  <span class="math">c_i</span>  even and  <span class="math">1 \\le \\ell_i \\le u</span> . In particular, an equation of the form of Equation (11) will involve only vectors of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{Q}_{2r}</span>  if and only if  <span class="math">\\ell-1 \\ge 1</span>  and c is even. Let us recall that the number of such equations is  <span class="math">N_1</span> , and consequently, its value is  <span class="math">\\sum_{t=0}^{r-2} \\sum_{\\ell=2}^{u} \\frac{1}{2}(2r-2^{\\ell})</span> , namely:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">On the other hand when  <span class="math">\\ell=1</span>  and c is even, say for instance c=2t' then Equation (11) becomes:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\sum_{b=0}^{r} \\gamma_b^2 \\mathbf{B}(t+b, 2t&#x27;, 1) = \\mathbf{B}(2t, 2t&#x27;+1, 0) + \\mathbf{B}(2t+1, 2t&#x27;, 0).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Notice that we always have B(b, c, 0) = B(c, b, 0). So if t' = t then  <span class="math">B(2t, 2t + 1, 0) + B(2t + 1, 2t, 0) = \\mathbf{0}</span>  and when  <span class="math">t \\neq t&#x27;</span>  we obviously have:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\sum_{b=0}^{r} \\gamma_b^2 \\mathbf{B}(t+b, 2t&#x27;, 1) = \\sum_{b=0}^{r} \\gamma_b^2 \\mathbf{B}(t&#x27;+b, 2t, 1).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In both case, we get new linear dependencies between vectors of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{Q}_{2r}</span>  different from those already obtained.In conclusion,  <span class="math">N_0</span>  is exactly the number of sets  <span class="math">\\{t,t&#x27;\\}</span> . By assumption t and t' have to satisfy  <span class="math">0 \\le t \\le r-2</span>  and c=2t' with  <span class="math">0 \\le c \\le 2r-3</span> , which implies that  <span class="math">0 \\le t&#x27; \\le r-2</span> .  <span class="math">N_0</span>  is therefore the number of couples (t,t') such that  <span class="math">0 \\le t \\le t&#x27; \\le r-2</span> .

    <h2 id="sec-10" class="text-2xl font-bold">VI. RANDOM CASE</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The purpose of this section is to study the behavior of  <span class="math">D_{\\text{random}}</span> , namely the dimension of  <span class="math">\\text{Ker}(\\mathcal{L}_{P})</span>  as  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> -vector space when the entries of the matrix P are drawn independently from the uniform distribution over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathbf{Pr}\\Big(D_{\\mathsf{random}}\\geqslant mr\\omega(mr)\\Big)=o(1),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">as mr goes to infinity.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Notice that if we choose  <span class="math">\\omega(x) = \\log(x)</span>  for instance, then asymptotically the dimension  <span class="math">D_{\\text{random}}</span>  of the solution space is with very large probability smaller than  <span class="math">mr \\log(mr)</span> . When m and r are of the same order (which is generally chosen in practice) this quantity is smaller than  <span class="math">D_{\\text{alternant}}</span>  or  <span class="math">D_{\\text{Goppa}}</span>  which are of the form  <span class="math">\\Omega(mr^2)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The main ingredient for proving Theorem 2 consists in analyzing a certain (partial) Gaussian elimination process on the matrix:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$M \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=} \\left( p_{ij} p_{ij&#x27;} \\right)_{\\substack{1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant k \\\\ k+1 \\leqslant j &lt; j&#x27; \\leqslant n}}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We can see the matrix M in block form, each block consists of the matrix</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$B_j = \\left(p_{i,k+j}p_{i,k+j&#x27;}\\right)_{\\substack{1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant k \\\\ 1 \\leqslant j &lt; j&#x27; \\leqslant n-k}}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Each block  <span class="math">B_j</span>  is of size  <span class="math">k \\times (rm-j)</span> . Notice that in  <span class="math">B_j</span> , the rows for which  <span class="math">p_{i,k+j}=0</span>  consist only of zeros. To start the Gaussian elimination process with  <span class="math">B_1</span> , we will therefore choose rm-1 rows for which  <span class="math">p_{i,k+1} \\neq 0</span> . This gives a square matrix  <span class="math">M_1</span> . We perform Gaussian elimination on M by adding rows involved in  <span class="math">M_1</span>  to put the first block  <span class="math">B_1</span>  in standard form. We continue this process with  <span class="math">B_2</span>  by picking now rm-2 rows which have not been chosen before and which correspond to  <span class="math">p_{i,k+2} \\neq 0</span> . This yields a square submatrix  <span class="math">M_2</span>  of size rm-2 and we continue this process until we reach the last block. The key observation is that:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\operatorname{rank}(M) \\geqslant \\operatorname{rank}(M_1) + \\cdots + \\operatorname{rank}(M_{rm-1}).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A rough analysis of this process yields Theorem 2. The important point is that what happens for different blocks are independent processes and it corresponds to looking at different rows of the matrix P. We give all the previous results that we need in order to prove Theorem 2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It will be convenient to assume that the columns of M are ordered lexicographically. The index of the first column is (j,j')=(k+1,k+2), the second one is (j,j')=(k+1,k+3), while the last one is (j,j')=(n-1,n). The matrices  <span class="math">M_i</span> 's which are involved in the Gaussian elimination process mentioned above are defined inductively as follows. Let  <span class="math">E_1</span>  be the subset of  <span class="math">\\{1,\\ldots,k\\}</span>  of indices s such that  <span class="math">p_{s,k+1}\\neq 0</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">r_1</span>  be the rank of  <span class="math">M_1</span> . To simplify the discussion, we assume that:</p>

    </ol></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that we can always assume this by performing suitable row and column permutations. In other words M has the following block structure:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$M = \\begin{pmatrix} N_1 &amp; B_1 \\\\ A_1 &amp; C_1 \\end{pmatrix}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We denote:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This is basically performing Gaussian elimination on M in order to have the first  <span class="math">r_1</span>  columns in standard form.

It is clear that the whole process leading to  <span class="math">M^{(rm-1)}</span>  amounts to perform (partial) Gaussian elimination to M. Hence:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Lemma 1: When  <span class="math">|E_i| \\ge rm - i</span> , for all  <span class="math">i \\in \\{1, ..., rm - 1\\}</span> , we have:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\operatorname{rank}(M)\\geqslant \\sum_{i=1}^{rm-1}\\operatorname{rank}(M_i).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Another observation is that  <span class="math">M_i</span>  is equal to the sum of the submatrix  <span class="math">(p_{s,k+i}p_{s,j})_{\\substack{s\\in F_i\\\\k+i&lt; j\\leqslant n}}</span>  of M and a certain matrix which is some function on the entries  <span class="math">p_{t,k+i}p_{t,j}</span>  where t belongs to  <span class="math">F_1\\cup\\ldots F_{i-1}</span>  and j ranges over  <span class="math">\\{k+i+1,n\\}</span> . Since by definition of  <span class="math">F_i, p_{s,k+i}</span>  is different from 0 for s in  <span class="math">F_i</span> . In addition, the rank of  <span class="math">M_i</span>  does not change by multiplying each row of index s by  <span class="math">p_{s,k+i}^{-1}</span> . Then, it turns out that the rank of  <span class="math">M_i</span>  is equal to the rank of a matrix which is the sum of the matrix  <span class="math">(p_{s,j})_{\\substack{s\\in F_i\\\\k+i&lt; j\\leqslant n}}</span> , another matrix depending on the  <span class="math">p_{t,k+i}p_{t,j}</span> 's (where t ranges over  <span class="math">F_1\\cup\\ldots F_{i-1}</span> ) and the  <span class="math">p_{s,k+1}</span> 's with  <span class="math">s\\in F_i</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">Lemma 2: Assume that  <span class="math">|E_i| \\geqslant rm-i</span>  for all  <span class="math">i \\in \\{1, \\dots, rm-1\\}</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">Another essential ingredient for proving Theorem 2 is the following well known lemma (see for instance [40][Theorem 1])</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Lemma 3: There exist two positive constants A and B depending on q such that the probability  <span class="math">p(s,\\ell)</span>  that a random  <span class="math">\\ell \\times \\ell</span>  matrix over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  is of rank  <span class="math">\\ell - s</span>  (where the coefficients are drawn independently from each other from the uniform distribution on  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> ) satisfies</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The existence of a distinguisher for the specific case of binary Goppa codes is not valid for any value of r and m but tends to be true for codes that have a rate  <span class="math">\\frac{n-mr}{n}</span>  very close to one. We will elaborate on this point below. This kind of codes are mainly encountered with the signature scheme [2]. If we assume that the length n is equal to  <span class="math">2^m</span>  and we denote by  <span class="math">r_{\\max}</span>  the smallest integer r such that  <span class="math">N-T_{\\text{Goppa}}\\geqslant 2^m-mr</span>  then any binary Goppa code of degree  <span class="math">r&lt; r_{\\max}</span>  can be distinguished (Table I). For example, the binary Goppa code obtained with m=13 and r=19 corresponding to a 90-bit security McEliece public key is distinguishable. More interestingly, all the keys proposed in [18] for the CFS signature scheme can be distinguished.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-12" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">A. Asymptotic Behaviour</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">When the length n of the code goes to infinity an asymptotic formula can be derived for the smallest rate  <span class="math">R_{\\rm crit}</span>  allowing distinguish a random code from an alternant code or a Goppa code. We derive such a formula when we assume for simplicity that the cardinality q of the base field is fixed and n is chosen as  <span class="math">n=q^m</span>  (in practice n is chosen either in this way or at least of the same order as  <span class="math">q^m</span> ). We also assume that the dimension k of the code satisfies k=n-rm. Finally, we also make the assumption that the dimensions  <span class="math">D_{\\rm alternant}</span>  and  <span class="math">D_{\\rm Goppa}</span>  are given by their theoretical values  <span class="math">T_{\\rm alternant}</span>  and  <span class="math">T_{\\rm Goppa}</span>  respectively and that the dimension of  <span class="math">D_{\\rm random}</span>  is given by  <span class="math">T_{\\rm random} \\stackrel{\\rm def}{=} \\max\\left(0,\\binom{mr}{2}-k\\right)</span> . This critical rate  <span class="math">r_{\\rm crit}</span>  corresponds to the smallest</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">value of r for which  <span class="math">T_{\\rm random}</span>  becomes bigger than  <span class="math">T_{\\rm alternant}</span>  (asymptotically there will be no difference between Goppa codes or alternant codes). It holds that:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$r_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=} \\min \\Big\\{ r &gt; 0 \\mid T_{\\mathrm{random}} \\geqslant T_{\\mathrm{alternant}} \\Big\\}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We let  <span class="math">R_{\\text{crit}} \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} \\frac{n - r_{\\text{crit}}m}{n} = 1 - \\frac{r_{\\text{crit}}m}{n}</span> . Our claim (whose proof is postponed in the appendix) is that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Theorem 3: Let us assume that  <span class="math">n = q^m</span> . When q is fixed and m tends to infinity then  <span class="math">r_{\\text{crit}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\, q^m \\log q}{m \\log m}} \\left(1 + o(1)\\right)</span>  and</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$R_{\\rm crit} = 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\, m \\, \\log q}{q^m \\log m}} \\Big( 1 + o(1) \\Big),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where all logarithms are taken to base 2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Table I, we have computed the value of  <span class="math">\\left[\\sqrt{\\frac{2q^m \\log q}{m \\log m}}\\right]</span>  for several m (q is equal to 2). This shows that our approximation is rather close to  <span class="math">r_{\\max}</span>  computed in practice even for small values of m.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We emphasize that the existence of such a distinguisher does not undermine the security of McEliece [3] or CFS [2]. It only shows that the GD assumption should be used with great care. It has also been observed in [41] that the value of D can be equivalently determined by considering the dimension of the square code of the dual of the public code. The square code construction relies on the component-wise product of vectors. For any vectors  <span class="math">\\mathbf{a} = (a_1, \\dots, a_n)</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbf{b} = (b_1, \\dots, b_n)</span>  we denote it by  <span class="math">\\mathbf{a} \\star \\mathbf{b} \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} (a_1b_1, \\dots, a_nb_n)</span> . For a code  <span class="math">\\mathscr{A}</span> , we denote by  <span class="math">\\mathscr{A}^2</span>  its square code which is the linear space spanned by  <span class="math">\\mathbf{a}_i \\star \\mathbf{a}_j</span>  where  <span class="math">\\mathbf{a}_i</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbf{a}_j</span>  describe a basis of  <span class="math">\\mathscr{A}</span> . If we denote by  <span class="math">\\mathscr{D}</span>  the dual of the public code then it turns out [41] that  <span class="math">\\dim(\\mathscr{D}^2) = \\binom{\\dim(\\mathscr{D})+1}{2} - D</span> . It should be added that this notion has been used recently to successfully attack several cryptographic schemes relying on (modified) generalized Reed-Solomon codes [42]. More generally, a natural open question is to investigate the hardness of GD for others codes having a polynomial-time decoding algorithm (for instance, LDPC, Reed-Muller,...).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Lastly, the recent work [30] shows that the natural reduction of GD to a hidden subgroup problem yields negligible information. As a consequence, it rules out the direct analogue of a quantum attack using the so-called Quantum Fourier Sampling (QFS) which breaks number theoretic problems [31]. More exactly, [30] shows that QFS has a negligible advantage against GD when the rate is  <span class="math">\\geqslant R_{\\rm QFS}</span>  where  <span class="math">R_{\\rm QFS} \\stackrel{\\rm def}{=} 1 - \\frac{\\log_q(n)^{3/2}}{\\sqrt{5n}} = 1 - \\frac{m^{3/2}}{\\sqrt{5 \\cdot q^{m/2}}}</span> . Whilst our result is somewhat contradictory with [30], it is interesting to observe that  <span class="math">R_{\\rm crit}</span>  and the critical rate  <span class="math">R_{\\rm QFS}</span>  share some similarities.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-14" class="text-2xl font-bold">APPENDIX</h2>

    <h2 id="sec-15" class="text-2xl font-bold">A. Experimental Results</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We gathered in Table II-XI some results obtained through intensive computations with the Magma system [39]. We randomly generated alternant and Goppa codes over the field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  with  <span class="math">q \\in \\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32\\}</span>  for values of r in the range  <span class="math">\\{3, \\dots, 50\\}</span>  and several m. The Goppa codes are generated by means of an irreducible  <span class="math">\\gamma(z)</span>  of degree r and hence  <span class="math">\\gamma(z)</span>  has no multiple roots. In particular, we can apply Theorem 1 in the binary case. We compare the dimensions of the solution space against the dimension  <span class="math">D_{\\text{random}}</span>  of the system derived from a random linear code. Table II and Table III give figures for the binary case with m=14. We can check that  <span class="math">D_{\\text{random}}</span>  is equal to 0 for  <span class="math">r \\in \\{3, \\ldots, 12\\}</span>  and  <span class="math">D_{\\text{random}} = N-k</span>  as expected. We remark that  <span class="math">D_{\\text{alternant}}</span>  is different from  <span class="math">D_{\\text{random}}</span>  whenever  <span class="math">r \\leqslant 15</span> , and  <span class="math">D_{\\text{Goppa}}</span>  is different from  <span class="math">D_{\\text{random}}</span>  as long as  <span class="math">r \\leqslant 25</span> . Finally we observe that our formulas for  <span class="math">T_{\\text{alternant}}</span>  fit as long as  <span class="math">k \\ge N - D_{\\text{alternant}}</span>  which correspond to  <span class="math">r \\le 15</span> . This is also the case for binary Goppa codes since we have  <span class="math">T_{\\text{Goppa}} = D_{\\text{Goppa}}</span>  as long as  <span class="math">k \\geqslant N - D_{\\text{Goppa}}</span>  i.e.,  <span class="math">r \\leqslant 25</span> . We also give in Table X and Table XI the examples we obtained for q=4 and m=6 to check that the arguments also apply. We also compare binary Goppa codes and random linear codes for m=15 in Table IV-VI and m=16 in Table VII-IX. We see that  <span class="math">D_{\\text{random}}</span>  and  <span class="math">D_{\\text{Goppa}}</span>  are different for  <span class="math">r \\leq 33</span>  when m = 15 and for m = 16 they are different even beyond our range of experiment  <span class="math">(r \\leq 50)</span> .</p>

.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The bound (23) on can be proved in the same way.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">From this lemma, we deduce that:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Lemma 8: There exist two constants  <span class="math">C_1</span>  and  <span class="math">C_2</span>  such that for every r satisfying  <span class="math">\\binom{mr}{2} \\ge n - mr</span>  we have:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$mr^2 \\left( m/2 - \\log_q(r) + C_1 \\right) - q^m \\leqslant T_{\\text{random}} - T_{\\text{alternant}},</span>$
(26)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$mr^2 \\left( m/2 - \\log_q(r) + C_2 \\right) - q^m \\geqslant T_{\\text{random}} - T_{\\text{alternant}}.</span>$
(27)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We also have the same inequalities when we replace  <span class="math">T_{\\text{random}} - T_{\\text{alternant}}</span>  with  <span class="math">T_{\\text{random}} - T_{\\text{Goppa}}</span> . <em>Proof:</em> For all positive integer values of r such that  <span class="math">\\binom{mr}{2} \\geqslant n - mr</span> , we have:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$T_{\\text{random}} = N - k = {mr \\choose 2} - q^m + mr</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">=  <span class="math">m^2 r^2 / 2 - q^m + mr / 2</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We can then conclude using Lemma 7.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">From this lemma, we derive the following estimate for  <span class="math">r_{\\text{crit}}</span> :</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Lemma 9: When m goes to infinity we have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$r_{\\rm crit} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2q^m \\log q}{m \\log m}} \\big(1 + o(1)\\big).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof: From Lemma 8, we know that:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$T_{\\text{random}} - T_{\\text{alternant}} = mr^2 \\left( m/2 - \\log_q(r) \\right) - q^m + O(mr^2).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">r_0 \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} \\sqrt{\\frac{2q^m \\log q}{m \\log m}}</span> . It holds that:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$2\\log_{q}(r_{0}) = \\log_{q}(2q^{m}\\log q) - \\log_{q}(m\\log m),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">=  <span class="math">m + \\log_{q}(2\\log q) - \\log_{q}(m) - \\log_{q}(\\log m).</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Thus by writing that  <span class="math">mr_0^2 (m/2 - \\log_q r_0) - q^m</span>  is equal to:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{2q^m \\log q}{\\log m} \\Big( m/2 - m/2 \\\\ &amp;- \\frac{\\log(2 \\log q)}{2 \\log q} + \\frac{\\log m}{2 \\log q} + \\frac{\\log \\log m}{2 \\log q} \\Big) - q^m \\end{aligned}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">which in turn equals  <span class="math">\\frac{q^m}{\\log m}</span>  ( <span class="math">\\log \\log m - \\log(2 \\log q)</span> ). We also observe that  <span class="math">mr_0^2 = \\frac{2q^m \\log q}{\\log m}</span>  is negligible compared to  <span class="math">\\frac{q^m}{\\log m}</span>  ( <span class="math">\\log \\log m - \\log(q)</span> ) when m goes to infinity. This can be used to show that  <span class="math">T_{\\text{random}} - T_{\\text{alternant}}</span>  is positive for  <span class="math">r = \\lceil r_0 \\rceil</span>  when m is large enough. Therefore for m large enough, we have  <span class="math">r_{\\text{crit}} \\leqslant \\lceil r_0 \\rceil</span> . On the other hand, let  <span class="math">\\alpha</span>  be any positive constant &lt; 1. We set:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$r_{\\alpha} \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\alpha q^m \\log q}{m \\log m}}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Notice that the function  <span class="math">f(x) = mx^2 \\left(m/2 - \\log_q x\\right) - q^m</span>  can be shown to be increasing in the range  <span class="math">(0, r_\\alpha)</span> . Therefore for every  <span class="math">r \\leqslant r_\\alpha</span> , we have  <span class="math">mr^2 \\left(m/2 - \\log_q r\\right) - q^m</span>  is less than or equal to:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$-q^m + \\frac{2\\alpha q^m \\log q}{\\log m} \\left( m/2 - m/2 + \\frac{\\log m}{2 \\log q} + \\frac{\\log \\log m}{2 \\log q} - \\frac{\\log(2\\alpha \\log q)}{2 \\log q} \\right),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This last quantity is upper-bounded by:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(\\alpha - 1)q^m + \\frac{2\\alpha q^m \\log q}{\\log m} \\left( \\frac{\\log \\log m}{2 \\log q} - \\frac{\\log(2\\alpha \\log q)}{2 \\log q} \\right)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">which in turn is less than or equal to:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(\\alpha - 1)q^m + q^m \\frac{\\alpha \\log \\log m}{\\log m}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since  <span class="math">mr^2 \\leqslant \\frac{2\\alpha q^m \\log q}{\\log m}</span> , it follows that any function of the form  <span class="math">mr^2 \\left(m/2 - \\log_q r\\right) - q^m + O(mr^2)</span>  will be negative for m large enough in the range  <span class="math">(0, r_\\alpha)</span> . This implies that  <span class="math">r_{\\rm crit} \\geqslant r_\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\alpha q^m \\log q}{m \\log m}}</span>  for m large enough. We deduce from this fact which holds for any  <span class="math">0 &lt; \\alpha &lt; 1</span>  and from the upper bound  <span class="math">r_{\\rm crit} \\leqslant \\lceil r_0 \\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\sqrt{\\frac{2q^m \\log q}{m \\log m}} \\right\\rceil</span>  that  <span class="math">r_{\\rm crit} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2q^m \\log q}{m \\log m}} (1 + o(1))</span>  when m goes to infinity. Finally, the proof of Theorem 3 is now obtained by remarking:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$R_{\\rm crit} = \\frac{q^m - mr_{\\rm crit}}{q^m} = 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\, m \\, \\log q}{q^m \\log m}} \\big(1 + o(1)\\big).</span>$</p>

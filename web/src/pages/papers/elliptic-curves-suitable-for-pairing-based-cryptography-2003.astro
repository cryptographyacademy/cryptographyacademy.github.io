    <p class="text-gray-300">We demonstrate our idea presenting several examples. The first example has already been considered in [3]. It can easily be deduced from our general approach. In all our examples, the number field  <span class="math">M = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D}, \\zeta_n)</span>  is a cyclotomic field and therefore has a power integer basis.</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Let  <span class="math">M = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_9)</span>  and  <span class="math">K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})</span> . The 9th cyclotomic polynomial is given by  <span class="math">x^6 + x^3 + 1</span> . Suppose  <span class="math">\\ell = x_0^6 + x_0^3 + 1</span>  for some integer  <span class="math">x_0</span>  and let D = -3. We would like to construct a suitable Frobenius element  <span class="math">\\frac{a+b\\sqrt{-3}}{2}</span> . The element a has to be equal to  <span class="math">\\zeta_9 + 1</span>  where  <span class="math">\\zeta_9</span>  is a ninth root of unity. We set  <span class="math">a = x_0 + 1</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">We now choose  <span class="math">x_0 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3</span> .

    <h2 id="sec-misc-2" class="text-2xl font-bold">4. Cryptographically interesting examples</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">4.1. Curves with low Hamming weight. Pairing based cryptography is very efficient if the prime  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  is a prime of low signed Hamming weight (see [4, 10]). For the signed Hamming weight we allow the coefficients of the binary expansion to be -1,0,1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using the method in section 2 we find some particularly nice examples. To find these examples we run through all cylcotomic fields with discriminant divisible by 3 or 4. For each field, we determine the minimal polynomial f(x) and test whether  <span class="math">f(x_0)</span>  is prime for some  <span class="math">x_0</span>  of low Hamming weight, say  <span class="math">x_0 = 2^i</span> ,  <span class="math">x_0 = 2^i \\pm 2^k</span>  or  <span class="math">x_0 = 3^i</span> . Next we choose a discriminant D = -3, -4, compute the corresponding polynomials a(x) and b'(x) and test whether  <span class="math">\\frac{a(x_0)^2 - D(b(x_0)&#x27;/D)^2}{4}</span>  is prime, too.</p>

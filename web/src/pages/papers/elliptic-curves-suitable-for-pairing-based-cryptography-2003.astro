We give a method for constructing ordinary elliptic curves over finite prime field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> with small security parameter <span class="math">k</span> with respect to a prime <span class="math">\\ell</span> dividing the group order <span class="math">\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_p)</span> such that <span class="math">p &amp;lt;&amp;lt; \\ell^2</span>.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-2" class="text-2xl font-bold">1. INTRODUCTION</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Over the last few years there has been an increasing interest in pairing based cryptography. The primitives of pairing based crypto systems are two groups <span class="math">(G, *)</span> and <span class="math">(H, \\circ)</span> in which the discrete logarithm problem is believed to be hard. Moreover, we require the existence of an efficiently computable, non-degenerate pairing <span class="math">G \\times G \\to H</span>. This additional structure allows many interesting protocols for all kind of different applications [5, 7, 11, 14].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Well known examples of such a pairing are the Weil and the Tate pairing on an elliptic curve. Here, <span class="math">G</span> is the group of points on an elliptic curve defined over a finite field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> and <span class="math">H</span> is equal to the multiplicative group of a field extension <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}^*</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 1.1.</strong> Let <span class="math">E</span> be an elliptic curve defined over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> whose group order <span class="math">\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span> is divisible by a prime <span class="math">\\ell</span>. Then <span class="math">E</span> has security parameter <span class="math">k</span> if <span class="math">k</span> is the smallest integer such that <span class="math">\\ell</span> divides <span class="math">q^k - 1</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If <span class="math">E</span> has security parameter <span class="math">k &amp;gt; 1</span> with respect to <span class="math">\\ell</span>, the Weil pairing <span class="math">e_{\\ell}</span> defines a non-degenerate pairing from the group of <span class="math">\\ell</span>-torsion points in <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}^<em>)</span> into <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}^</em></span>. It can be evaluated in <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}(k^2 \\log^3 q)</span> bit operations. Supersingular elliptic curves have security parameter less than or equal to 6 [9, 13].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is an interesting question whether there exist suitable elliptic curves with <span class="math">k \\geq 7</span>. Obviously, they can not be supersingular. But ordinary elliptic curves with such a small security parameter are very rare [2]. We are left with the problem to construct ordinary curves with relatively small security parameter (see e.g. [5, 8]).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">E</span> be an ordinary elliptic curve defined over a finite field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> and let <span class="math">\\ell</span> be a prime dividing the group order <span class="math">\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span> such that <span class="math">E</span> has security parameter <span class="math">k</span> with respect to <span class="math">\\ell</span>. We have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(1) <span class="math">\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_q) = q + 1 - t \\equiv 0 \\mod \\ell \\text{ and } \\quad (2) \\quad q^k - 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod \\ell. \\quad</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Inserting equation (2) in (1) shows that <span class="math">(t - 1)</span> must be a <span class="math">k</span>th root of unity modulo <span class="math">\\ell</span>. On the other hand, if <span class="math">E</span> is an elliptic curve over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> satisfying equation (1) and <span class="math">t = \\zeta_k + 1 \\mod \\ell</span> for some primitive <span class="math">k</span>th roots of unity modulo <span class="math">\\ell</span>, <span class="math">E</span> has security parameter <span class="math">k</span> with respect to <span class="math">\\ell</span>. This fact has first been discovered by Cocks and Pinch [6].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since <span class="math">E</span> is ordinary, it has complex multiplication by some order <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}</span> of discriminant</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">d = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l l} \\frac {D}{4} &amp;amp; \\text{if } D \\equiv 0 \\mod 4 \\\\ D &amp;amp; \\text{else.} \\end{array} \\right.</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The Frobenius element <span class="math">\\pi_q : (x, y) \\to (x^q, y^q)</span> corresponds to an element <span class="math">w = \\frac{a + b\\sqrt{D}}{2} \\in \\mathcal{O}</span> such that <span class="math">\\mathrm{Norm}_{K / \\mathbb{Q}}(w) = w\\overline{w} = q</span>. We have <span class="math">t = a</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This observation leads to a simple algorithm. Given an imaginary quadratic field <span class="math">K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})</span>. Take a prime <span class="math">\\ell</span> with the properties that <span class="math">\\ell</span> splits in <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}_K</span> and <span class="math">\\ell \\equiv 1 \\mod k</span> and determine a <span class="math">k</span>th root of unity <span class="math">\\zeta_k</span> modulo <span class="math">\\ell</span>. Set <span class="math">a = \\zeta_k + 1 \\mod \\ell</span> and <span class="math">b = \\pm \\frac{a - 2}{2} \\mod \\ell</span> where <span class="math">\\delta</span> is a square root of <span class="math">d</span> modulo <span class="math">\\ell</span>. Finally test whether <span class="math">\\mathrm{Norm}_{K / \\mathbb{Q}}(w)</span> is a prime <span class="math">p</span> (or a prime power <span class="math">q</span>). We find the corresponding elliptic curve defined over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> (or <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>) using the complex multiplication method (for the CM method see e.g. [1]).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The correctness of this method can easily be seen by the following lemma which summarizes the discussion above.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lemma 1.2.</strong> Let <span class="math">E / \\mathbb{F}_q</span> be an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by an order <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}</span> in <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})</span> such that the Frobenius endomorphism corresponds to the imaginary quadratic integer <span class="math">w = \\frac{a + b\\sqrt{D}}{2}</span> with <span class="math">a, b</span> constructed as above. Then <span class="math">\\# E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span> is divisibly by <span class="math">\\ell</span> and has security parameter <span class="math">k</span> with respect to <span class="math">\\ell</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Proof.</strong> By the choice of <span class="math">b</span>, we find</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\# E \\left(\\mathbb {F} _ {q}\\right) = \\operatorname {N o r m} _ {\\mathbb {Q} (\\sqrt {D}) / \\mathbb {Q}} (w - 1) = \\frac {1}{4} ((a - 2) ^ {2} - D b ^ {2}) \\equiv 0 \\mod \\ell .</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since the trace <span class="math">t</span> of <span class="math">\\pi_q</span> is equal to <span class="math">a = \\zeta_k + 1 \\mod \\ell</span>, the security parameter of <span class="math">E</span> with respect to <span class="math">\\ell</span> is equal to <span class="math">k</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that the case that <span class="math">\\mathrm{Norm}_{K / \\mathbb{Q}}(w)</span> is not a prime but a prime power is very unlikely. Hence in the following we only consider the case where <span class="math">\\mathrm{Norm}_{K / \\mathbb{Q}}(w)</span> is prime.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The values <span class="math">a</span> and <span class="math">b</span> are solutions of equations modulo <span class="math">\\ell</span>. Hence, they will in general be of size <span class="math">O(\\ell)</span> leading to a prime of size <span class="math">O(\\ell^2)</span>. Desirable would be to have <span class="math">p</span> of size <span class="math">O(\\ell)</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is still an open question to find an algorithm for the construction of ordinary elliptic curves with arbitrary security parameter <span class="math">k</span> where <span class="math">p</span> is significantly smaller than <span class="math">\\ell</span>. Barreto, Lynn and Scott describe a method to derive a better relation between <span class="math">p</span> and <span class="math">\\ell</span> for the case where <span class="math">k</span> is divisible by 3 [5]. In this paper we extend their idea using the fact described above to get more examples of curves with <span class="math">p &amp;lt;&amp;lt; \\ell^2</span>. Moreover we find examples where <span class="math">\\ell</span> is a prime of low Hamming weight with respect to the basis 2. For such primes, the Weil resp. Tate pairing can efficiently be evaluated [4, 10].</p>

    <h2 id="sec-3" class="text-2xl font-bold">2. THE MAIN IDEA</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We explain the main idea in the case where <span class="math">D</span> is odd. Note that it can easily be modified for <span class="math">D \\equiv 0 \\mod 4</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Given <span class="math">k</span> and a discriminant <span class="math">D &amp;lt; 0</span> which is not too large. We can consider the number field <span class="math">M(\\zeta_n, D)</span>. Suppose <span class="math">M \\simeq \\mathbb{Q}[x] / (f(x))</span> where <span class="math">f</span> is a irreducible polynomial of degree <span class="math">d</span> where <span class="math">d = 2n</span> or <span class="math">n</span> depending on whether <span class="math">\\sqrt{D} \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)</span> or not.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">ELLiptic curves suitable for pairing based cryptography</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Moreover we require that <span class="math">f</span> represents primes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Every element in <span class="math">M</span> can be represented by a polynomial of degree <span class="math">\\leq d - 1</span>. We can compute the polynomials <span class="math">g_1, \\ldots, g_{\\varphi(k)}</span> which represent the primitive <span class="math">k</span>th roots of unity. Let <span class="math">h_1, -h_1</span> be the polynomials which represent <span class="math">\\sqrt{D}</span>. Suppose that <span class="math">g_i</span> and <span class="math">h_i</span> lie in <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}[x]</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We now set</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">a(x) = (g_i(x) + 1)</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">b&#x27;(x) = (a(x) - 2)h_j(x) \\text{ in } \\mathbb{Q}[x]/(f(x)).</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">for some <span class="math">i, j</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We test if there exists some congruence class <span class="math">x_0 \\mod (-D)</span> such that <span class="math">b&#x27;(x_0) \\equiv 0 \\mod (-D)</span>. For all <span class="math">x_1, x_0 \\equiv x_1 \\mod (-D)</span>, <span class="math">b&#x27;(x_1)/D</span> will be in <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}</span>. We can now define</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">p(x) = \\frac{1}{4}(a(x)^2 - \\frac{b&#x27;(x)^2}{D}).</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Now suppose the following conditions are satisfied:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li><span class="math">p(x)</span> is irreducible,</li>

      <li><span class="math">p(x)</span> has integer values for <span class="math">x_0 \\mod (-D)</span> and</li>

      <li><span class="math">f(Dy + x_0) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[y]</span> is irreducible.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We can then try to find primes <span class="math">\\ell = f(x_1)</span> for some <span class="math">x_1 \\equiv x_0 \\mod D</span> and test whether <span class="math">p(x_1)</span> is prime as well.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We easily check that if <span class="math">a(x_1), b&#x27;(x_1)</span> are constructed as above, there exists an elliptic curve over the prime field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p(x_1)}</span> with complex multiplication by the maximal order <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}_K</span> in <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})</span> such that the Frobenius endomorphism of <span class="math">E</span> corresponds to the element</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\frac{a(x_1) \\pm \\frac{b&#x27;(x_1)}{D} \\sqrt{D}}{2} \\in \\mathcal{O}_K.</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The order <span class="math">\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{p(x_1)})</span> is equal to</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and will by construction be divisible by <span class="math">\\ell</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The degrees of <span class="math">a(x)</span> and <span class="math">b&#x27;(x)</span> are less than equal to <span class="math">\\deg(f) - 1 = d - 1</span>.

In special cases, the relation between <span class="math">\\ell</span> and <span class="math">p</span> will be even better.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that the assumption that <span class="math">a(x)</span> and <span class="math">b&#x27;(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]</span> is very strong since only few number fields <span class="math">M</span> have a power integer basis.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We demonstrate our idea presenting several examples. The first example has already been considered in [3]. It can easily be deduced from our general approach. In all our examples, the number field <span class="math">M = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D}, \\zeta_n)</span> is a cyclotomic field and therefore has a power integer basis.</p>

Suppose <span class="math">\\ell = x_0^6 + x_0^3 + 1</span> for some integer <span class="math">x_0</span> and let <span class="math">D = -3</span>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Pairing based cryptography is very efficient if the prime <span class="math">\\ell</span> is a prime of low signed Hamming weight (see [4, 10]).

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using the method in section 2 we find some particularly nice examples. To find these examples we run through all cylcotomic fields with discriminant divisible by 3 or 4. For each field, we determine the minimal polynomial <span class="math">f(x)</span> and test whether <span class="math">f(x_0)</span> is prime for some <span class="math">x_0</span> of low Hamming weight, say <span class="math">x_0 = 2^i</span>, <span class="math">x_0 = 2^i \\pm 2^k</span> or <span class="math">x_0 = 3^i</span>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that a subtraction has the same complexity as an addition, since taking the additive inverse on an elliptic curve is a free operation.</p>

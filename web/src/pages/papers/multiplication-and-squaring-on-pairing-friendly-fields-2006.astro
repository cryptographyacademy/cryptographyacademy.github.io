      <p class="text-gray-300">Abstract. Pairing-friendly fields are finite fields that are suitable for the implementation of cryptographic bilinear pairings. In this paper we review multiplication and squaring methods for pairing-friendly fields Fp<sup>k</sup> with k ∈ &#123;2, 3, 4, 6&#125;. For composite k, we consider every possible towering construction. We compare the methods to determine which is most efficient based on the number of basic F<sup>p</sup> operations, as well as the best constructions for these finite extension fields. We also present experimental results for every method.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Keywords: Finite fields, pairings, efficient implementation.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">In recent years, bilinear pairings have been used to construct new cryptographic schemes with many novel and exciting properties, such as the one-round, threeparty key agreement protocol of Joux [11] and the identity-based encryption scheme of Boneh and Franklin [4]. Pairing computation is generally the most intensive computational requirement in pairing-based schemes, and therefore it is of paramount importance to implement pairings in an efficient manner.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Pairing-friendly fields were introduced by Koblitz and Menezes [14] as an efficient way to implement the various finite fields extensions required for pairingbased cryptography. There are two advantages to constructing finite fields in this manner. Firstly, they provide for efficient arithmetic, as multiplication by certain terms that define the field is trivial. Secondly, they allow for an easy way to analyse the cost of multiplications, something which has been utilised by various parties ([7, 8, 10]) to conduct a theoretical analysis of the cost of computing pairings using these fields.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">However, these analyses consider that squaring takes as much time or as many ground field operations as multiplication. Let  <span class="math">k=2^i3^j</span>  be the extension degree of a pairing-friendly field. Koblitz and Menezes [14] define the function  <span class="math">\nu(k)=3^i5^j</span>  to compute the number of ground field operations needed to multiply two elements in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^k&#125;</span>  — multiplication in a quadratic extension can be computed with three multiplications in the ground field using Karatsuba, and multiplication in a cubic extension can be computed with five multiplications in the ground field using Toom-Cook-3. However, there are situations where Karatsuba is more efficient than Toom-Cook for cubic extensions. Furthermore, squaring in quadratic extensions needs fewer ground field multiplications. As pairing-friendly fields have an even extension degree in order to facilitate the denominator elimination optimisation, there is always at least one quadratic extension. Therefore, the number of ground field operations for squaring is certainly less than that provided by the function  <span class="math">\nu(k)</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The contribution of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we review the definition of pairing-friendly fields and methods for multiplication and squaring. In Sections 3, 4, 5, and 6, we analyse methods for multiplication and squaring in quadratic, cubic, quartic and sextic extensions. In Section 7 and the appendix, we present our experimental results on the implementation of every method for multiplication and squaring in the various extension fields, as well as different constructions for composite extension degrees. We conclude in Section 8, and provide recommendations on the most efficient methods for each extension field.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">When computing pairings, one must construct a representation for the finite field  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^k&#125;</span> , where k is the embedding degree of the curve in question. The finite field  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^k&#125;</span>  is implemented as  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_p[X]/(f(X))</span> , where f(X) is an irreducible polynomial of degree k over  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_p</span> . Elements of  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^k&#125;</span>  are represented using the polynomial basis  <span class="math">(1, X, X^2, \dots, X^&#123;k-1&#125;)</span> , where X is a root of the irreducible polynomial over  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^k&#125;</span> . Multiplication is computed as a multiplication of polynomials, followed by a reduction modulo the irreducible polynomial f(X), which can be built into the formulæ for multiplication.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Koblitz and Menezes [14] define a field  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^k&#125;</span>  as being pairing-friendly if the prime characteristic  <span class="math">p \equiv 1 \pmod&#123;12&#125;</span>  and the embedding degree  <span class="math">k = 2^i 3^j</span> , i &gt; 0. Let  <span class="math">\beta</span>  be an element of  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_p</span>  that is neither a square nor a cube in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_p</span> . Then the binomial  <span class="math">X^k - \beta</span>  is irreducible over  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_p[X]</span>  and hence defines the field  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^k&#125;</span> . Therefore, the field  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^k&#125;</span>  can be constructed as a series of quadratic and cubic Kummer extensions by adjoining either the square root or cube root of  <span class="math">\beta</span> , and successively the square root or cube root of that, until the field is constructed. If  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^k&#125;</span>  can be constructed by towering quadratic extensions alone, i.e. if j = 0, then the condition on the prime p simplifies to  <span class="math">p \equiv 1 \pmod&#123;4&#125;</span> , and  <span class="math">\beta</span>  need only be a non-square in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_p</span> . Note that  <span class="math">k = 2^i 3^j</span>  supports almost all embedding degrees used in practise, i.e. k = 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, etc.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The advantage of constructing finite fields in this manner is that a small value of  <span class="math">\beta</span>  can be exploited to simplify arithmetic. Multiplication by  <span class="math">\beta</span>  is achieved by a simple reordering of terms and roughly  <span class="math">|\beta|</span>  additions, which is far less expensive than a general multiplication.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">As this paper focuses on multiplication and squaring, we recall briefly various techniques in the literature (see [2,13] for an overview) for multiplying two n-digit integers. The basic Schoolbook multiplication method for multiplying two n-word integers has complexity  <span class="math">O(n^2)</span> . Karatsuba [12] presented the first sub-quadratic time multiplication method, which has complexity  <span class="math">O(n^&#123;\lg(3)&#125;) \approx O(n^&#123;1.585&#125;)</span> . Karatsuba's method proceeds by splitting the integers into two parts, and therefore it is natural to consider using it to implement multiplication in quadratic field extensions. Toom [19] and later Cook [6] extended Karatsuba's method by splitting the integers into three parts. The resulting Toom-Cook algorithm has complexity  <span class="math">O(n^&#123;1.46&#125;)</span> , and can be used to implement multiplication in a cubic field extension.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Assume  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^k&#125;</span>  is a direct extension of  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_p</span>  and an element  <span class="math">a \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^k&#125;</span>  is represented as  <span class="math">a_0 + a_1 X + \cdots + a_&#123;k-1&#125; X^&#123;k-1&#125;</span> . We perform multiplication and squaring of elements in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^k&#125;</span>  as the polynomial multiplication (resp. squaring) in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_p[X]</span>  and then reduction by  <span class="math">(X^k - \beta)</span> . The Schoolbook method for multiplying two elements  <span class="math">a, b \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^k&#125;</span>  is defined as</p>
      <div class="math-block">c = ab = \left(\sum_&#123;i=0&#125;^&#123;k-1&#125; a_i X^i\right) \left(\sum_&#123;i=0&#125;^&#123;k-1&#125; b_i X^i\right) \pmod&#123;(X^k - \beta)&#125;,</div>
      <p class="text-gray-300">and the coefficients of c after the reduction by  <span class="math">(X^k - \beta)</span>  are</p>
      <div class="math-block">c_i = \sum_&#123;j=0&#125;^&#123;i&#125; a_j b_&#123;i-j&#125; + \beta \left( \sum_&#123;j=i+1&#125;^&#123;k-1&#125; a_j b_&#123;i-j+k&#125; \right) \pmod&#123;p&#125;.</div>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The Karatsuba method for computing the product  <span class="math">c = ab \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^2&#125;</span>  proceeds by precomputing  <span class="math">v_0 = a_0b_0</span> ,  <span class="math">v_1 = a_1b_1</span>  and then</p>
      <div class="math-block">c_0 = v_0 + \beta v_1</div>
      <div class="math-block">c_1 = (a_0 + a_1)(b_0 + b_1) - v_0 - v_1.</div>
      <p class="text-gray-300">To compute the product  <span class="math">c = ab \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^3&#125;</span> , the Karatsuba method precomputes  <span class="math">v_0 = a_0b_0</span> ,  <span class="math">v_1 = a_1b_1</span> ,  <span class="math">v_2 = a_2b_2</span>  and then</p>

      <div class="math-block">c_2 = (a_0 + a_2)(b_0 + b_2) - v_0 + v_1 - v_2.</div>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Weimerskirch and Paar discuss in [20] the Karatsuba method and its application to arbitrary degree polynomials.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The Toom-Cook method is based on interpolation: given the evaluation of a degree-n polynomial at n+1 distinct points, it is possible to uniquely determine</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">it. Before the reduction modulo (X<sup>k</sup> −β), the product of two elements a, b ∈ Fp<sup>k</sup> is a degree-(2k − 2) polynomial. The Toom-Cook method applied to multiplication of polynomials is essentially an interpolation: choose a family &#123;xi&#125;0≤i&lt;2k−<sup>1</sup> of distinct points in Fp, evaluate the product a(xi)b(xi) ∈ F<sup>p</sup> on every point of the family, and interpolate the evaluation points in order to (uniquely) obtain the product ab ∈ Fp[X]. Then reduce it modulo (X<sup>k</sup> −β) to obtain c = ab ∈ Fp<sup>k</sup> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The efficiency of the Toom-Cook method depends on the choice of the points x<sup>i</sup> and the method for interpolation, and it is still not clear which yields the most efficient Toom-Cook implementation. See [3, 5] for a recent discussion on these issues. In this text, we use the points 0 &lt; x<sup>i</sup> &lt; k − 2 and their additive inverses, k − 2, 0, and ∞ for computing the evaluation points: these are the values that give the least absolute value integers in the formula, and we use the Lagrange method for interpolation.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The Toom-Cook method needs to compute divisions by integers 2, 3, . . . , 2(k − 1) [2, 5]. Division by two can be efficiently implemented using bit shifts, but division by integers greater than two is more costly. Notice that in the context of pairing computation the pairing value may be freely multiplied by any integer (in fact, by any element of a proper subfield of Fp<sup>k</sup> ) without affecting the value of the pairing — the final exponentiation wipes out these factors [1, Corollary 1]. Multiplying the product ab ∈ Fp<sup>k</sup> by the least common multiple of all the divisors that appear in the Toom-Cook formulæ avoids all divisions and may be used as a replacement for the original Toom-Cook in the context of pairing computation. We call this method Toom-Cook-x.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Other methods for multiplication and squaring in finite extension fields include the asymmetric squaring formulæ by Chung and Hasan [5], and Montgomery's improved Karatsuba-like formulæ [17].</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Our analysis of the cost for multiplying and squaring elements in finite extension fields is based on the following operations on the ground field: multiplication (M), squaring (S), addition or subtraction (A), division by 2 (D2), multiplication by β (B), and multiplication by small (word-size) integers (MZ). Note that A, D2, B, M<sup>Z</sup> are linear on the extension degree, while M and S are super-linear.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Note that it is possible to implement Fp<sup>k</sup> operations using lazy reduction (or accumulation and reduction) [9, 15, 18]. In this technique, instead of computing a modular reduction at every ground field operation, the operands are computed as integers, accumulated during various operations and later reduced modulo p. This saves reduction operations at the expense of greater memory requirements, poor interaction with Montgomery reduction and more additions. We leave lazy reduction outside the scope of the present work, but it might be worthwhile to further research this matter.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">A remark on multiplication by β: throughout this text, x + βy is costed as A+B (one addition and one multiplication by β). If β = −2, then x+βy = x−2y, so the actual cost is 2A. Another example: 2x+βy is costed as 2A+B. Again, if β = −2, then 2x+βy = 2(x−y), and the actual cost is 2A. Yet another example: x + βx is costed as A + B. If β = −1, then the actual cost is 0; if β = −2, the actual cost is A. Depending on the value of β, the actual cost of a formula varies. It is important to bear this is mind while reading the next sections. For the sake of simplicity, it is possible to assume that  <span class="math">B = (|\beta| - 1)</span>  as an approximation.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We construct a quadratic extension as  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^2&#125; = \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_p[X]/(X^2 - \beta)</span> , where  <span class="math">\beta</span>  is a quadratic non-residue in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_p</span> . An element  <span class="math">\alpha \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^2&#125;</span>  is represented as  <span class="math">\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X</span> , where  <span class="math">\alpha_i \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_p</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The Schoolbook method computes the product c = ab as</p>
      <div class="math-block">c_0 = a_0 b_0 + \beta a_1 b_1</div>
      <div class="math-block">c_1 = a_0 b_1 + a_1 b_0,</div>
      <p class="text-gray-300">which costs 4M + 2A + B, and the square  <span class="math">c = a^2</span>  as</p>
      <div class="math-block">c_0 = a_0^2 + \beta a_1^2</div>
      <div class="math-block">c_1 = 2a_0 a_1,</div>
      <p class="text-gray-300">which takes M + 2S + 2A + B. The Karatsuba method computes c = ab by first precomputing the values  <span class="math">v_0 = a_0b_0</span> ,  <span class="math">v_1 = a_1b_1</span> . Then the multiplication is performed as</p>
      <div class="math-block">c_0 = v_0 + \beta v_1</div>
      <div class="math-block">c_1 = (a_0 + a_1)(b_0 + b_1) - v_0 - v_1,</div>
      <p class="text-gray-300">which costs 3M + 5A + B in total. Adapting the Karatsuba formula for squaring, we first precompute  <span class="math">v_0 = a_0^2</span> ,  <span class="math">v_1 = a_1^2</span>  and then compute the square  <span class="math">c = a^2</span>  as</p>
      <div class="math-block">c_0 = v_0 + \beta v_1</div>
      <div class="math-block">c_1 = (a_0 + a_1)^2 - v_0 - v_1,</div>
      <p class="text-gray-300">which costs 3S + 4A + B. There is a well-known squaring formula for complex arithmetic<sup>3</sup> that computes the square  <span class="math">c_0 + c_1 i = (a_0 + a_1 i)^2</span>  as</p>
      <div class="math-block">c_0 = (a_0 + a_1)(a_0 - a_1)</div>
      <div class="math-block">c_1 = 2a_0a_1.</div>
      <p class="text-gray-300">This is actually a special case of a squaring formula that we refer to as complex squaring. We precompute  <span class="math">v_0 = a_0 a_1</span> , and then the square  <span class="math">c = a^2</span>  is computed as</p>
      <div class="math-block">c_0 = (a_0 + a_1)(a_0 + \beta a_1) - v_0 - \beta v_0</div>

      <p class="text-gray-300">Tables 1 and 2 list the multiplication and squaring costs of the methods above, and the conditions where one method is faster than the others. For sufficiently large moduli, Karatsuba is the most efficient multiplication method. Under the assumption that a modular squaring in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_p</span>  takes approximately the same time as modular multiplication in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_p</span> , complex squaring is the most efficient method.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">Montgomery in [17] presented a formula for multiplying quintic polynomials that needs one less multiplication than Karatsuba. The formula depends on the choice of a polynomial C; we have arbitrarily chosen  <span class="math">C=X^6</span> . For the sake of space, the detailed formula is presented in the appendix. The total cost for multiplication is 17M+143A+5B, and the total cost for squaring is 17S+123A+5B.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We proceed to analyse the Toom-Cook method for sextic extensions. The  <span class="math">x_i</span>  points for evaluation are  <span class="math">\&#123;0,\pm 1,\pm 2,\pm 3,\pm 4,5,\infty\&#125;</span> . The first step is to precompute the interpolation points  <span class="math">v_i = a(P_i)b(P_i), 0 \le i \le 10</span> . Notice that, in absolute value, 5 is the biggest evaluation point. As a, b are quintic polynomials, the biggest coefficient is  <span class="math">5^5 = 3125</span> . If we use addition chains to compute the coefficients of  <span class="math">a(P_i), b(P_i)</span>  except for 81, 243, 625 and 3125, where we use multiplication by (small) integers, the cost of computing the interpolation points is  <span class="math">11M + 8M_&#123;\mathbb&#123;Z&#125;&#125; + 146A</span>  for multiplication, and  <span class="math">11S + 4M_&#123;\mathbb&#123;Z&#125;&#125; + 73A</span>  for squaring. The interpolation formula is listed in the appendix. As in the case of cubic extensions, we compute the product c = 362880ab (or the square  <span class="math">c = 362880a^2</span> ) in order to completely avoid divisions, and the formula is listed in the appendix. Because the vast majority of the coefficients in the formula are too big to be considered for addition chains, we compute them as multiplication by small integers. The cost for the interpolation is  <span class="math">75M_&#123;\mathbb&#123;Z&#125;&#125; + 90A + 5B</span> . The total cost for multiplication is  <span class="math">11M + 93M_&#123;\mathbb&#123;Z&#125;&#125; + 236A + 5B</span> , and the total cost for squaring is  <span class="math">11S + 79M_&#123;\mathbb&#123;Z&#125;&#125; + 163A + 5B.</span></p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">The performance of multiplication and squaring was measured on a Pentium IV 2.8 GHz with 512 MB of RAM and a 512 KB cache, running GNU/Linux 2.6.15. We have used the MIRACL library for big number and modular arithmetic. Programs were coded in C and compiled with the GNU C Compiler version 4.1.2 (prerelease). Standard compiler (-02) and IA-32/Intel SSE2 (-msse2) optimisations were used.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The MIRACL library implements multi-precision number arithmetic, and supports a number of powerful optional optimizations. In particular it supports completely unrolled assembly language support for fixed-size big number multiplication and modular reduction. Internally, prime field elements are in Montgomery representation [16], which allows for fast reduction without divisions. The memory for big numbers can be allocated from the heap, or more efficiently from the stack, which is the case for our experiments. When required to multiply</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">big numbers by a small integer, multiplications by numbers less than or equal to 6 are instead carried out by up to 3 modular additions.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The pairing-friendly fields were constructed as follows. We generated five random primes  <span class="math">p_i</span>  where  <span class="math">\beta = -2</span>  is both a quadratic and cubic non-residue in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p_i&#125;</span> , and  <span class="math">\lceil \log_2 p_i \rceil \in \&#123;160, 192, 224, 256, 512\&#125;</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We constructed the extensions with degree  <span class="math">k \in \&#123;2, 3, 4, 6\&#125;</span>  as:</p>
      <div class="math-block">\begin&#123;split&#125; \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^2&#125; &= \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_p[X]/(X^2+2) \text&#123; (quadratic)&#125; \\ \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^3&#125; &= \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_p[X]/(X^3+2) \text&#123; (cubic)&#125; \\ \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^4&#125; &= \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^2&#125;[Y]/(Y^2-\sqrt&#123;-2&#125;) \text&#123; (quadratic over quadratic)&#125; \\ \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^4&#125; &= \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_p[X]/(X^4+2) \text&#123; (direct quartic)&#125; \\ \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^6&#125; &= \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^3&#125;[Y]/(Y^2-\sqrt[3]&#123;-2&#125;) \text&#123; (quadratic over cubic)&#125; \\ \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^6&#125; &= \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^2&#125;[Y]/(Y^3-\sqrt&#123;-2&#125;) \text&#123; (cubic over quadratic)&#125; \\ \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^6&#125; &= \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_p[X]/(X^6+2) \text&#123; (direct sextic)&#125;. \end&#123;split&#125;</div>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We implemented all the methods described in this paper; for extension towers, we implemented all the possible combinations. Methods that use divisions, such as CH-SQR3 and Toom-Cook-3, were implemented without divisions; instead, we multiplied the result by the least common multiple of the denominators as described in Section 2.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The timing method for multiplication starts by generating two random field elements  <span class="math">a, b \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_q</span>  and then computes  <span class="math">a \leftarrow ab</span>  repeatedly. For squaring, the method generates random  <span class="math">a \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_q</span>  and then computes  <span class="math">a \leftarrow a^2</span>  repeatedly. Each timing program was run several times in order to ensure randomness.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Timings are presented in the Appendix. Tables 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23 show the absolute timings for each method and field. The fastest method is highlighted with a star symbol, and other methods that are not more than 10% slower than the fastest method are highlighted with an equal sign. Tables 20, 24 summarise the methods that have the best performance for k = 4, 6 among the different construction possibilities.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We analysed different multiplication and squaring methods for finite extension fields  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^k&#125;</span>  with  <span class="math">k \in \&#123;2, 3, 4, 6\&#125;</span> , detailing the cost of each method with regard to operations in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_p</span> . We also timed every method using the MIRACL library and primes p with bitlengths 160, 192, 224, 256, and 512.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Our first observation is a comparison about the time to compute a product and the time to compute a square. If we consider only the super-linear operations on the ground field, squaring costs 1M less than multiplication in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^2&#125;</span> , 3M less in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^4&#125;</span> , and 5M less in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^6&#125;</span> . Our experimental results show that multiplication in these fields is about 40% slower than squaring. In Miller's algorithm to compute the Tate pairing, the accumulating variable that is defined over  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;p^k&#125;</span>  is normally squared each iteration of the loop, leading to a large amount of squarings in</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">total. It is therefore important, when analysing the cost of pairing computation, to make a clear distinction between multiplication and squaring, a distinction that has been neglected in some analyses [7, 8, 10, 14].</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">A second observation is that, for composite k, constructing Fp<sup>k</sup> as a high tower of extensions seems to yield the most efficient implementations for multiplication and squaring. There are very efficient formulæ for quadratic and cubic extensions, but not for higher degrees. Our best multiplication and squaring timings for Fp<sup>6</sup> were obtained in the quadratic over cubic construction.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Another observation is that Toom-Cook is the method that asymptotically requires the least number of multiplication or squarings in the underlying field. However, both the computation of the evaluation points and the interpolation incur a number of additions and multiplications by word-size integers, as well as divisions, that result in an inefficient method. Toom-Cook-3 is an exception: its formula is simple and requires only one division by 3. Montgomery has presented formulæ that use less multiplication operations than a recursive application of Karatsuba, but the overhead of his method when applied to finite extension fields make it less efficient.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We also point out the recent development of efficient formulæ for squaring by Chung and Hasan [5], Montgomery's work on improving the number of multiplications required by Karatsuba [17], and the investigation of Bodrato and Zanoni on efficient ways to compute Toom-Cook [3]. They have used computerassisted techniques to improve standard multiplication and squaring formulæ, and it is quite possible that there will be further improvements on methods for multiplication and squaring in the future.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Our final observation is a set of recommendations on the most efficient methods for each extension degree. For quadratic extensions, use Karatsuba for multiplication and Complex for squaring. For cubic extensions, if M &lt; 26A then use Karatsuba for multiplication; otherwise, use Toom-Cook-3x. For squaring, either Chung-Hasan SQR1 or SQR2. For quartic extensions, construct the extension as quadratic over quadratic, and use Karatsuba over Karatsuba for multiplication and Complex over Karatsuba for squaring. For sextic extensions, if M &lt; 20A, construct the extension as quadratic over cubic, use Karatsuba over Karatsuba for multiplication, and use Complex over Karatsuba for squaring. If M ≥ 20A, construct the extension as cubic over quadratic, use Toom-Cook-3x over Karatsuba for multiplication and either Complex, Chung-Hasan SQR3 or SQR3x over Karatsuba/Complex for squaring. Whenever it is necessary to map between different finite extension field constructions, there are very efficient isomorphisms available.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">Montgomery in [17] presented a formula for multiplying quintic polynomials that needs one less multiplication than Karatsuba.

We start by computing the 17 ground field products as follows (note that v<sup>1</sup> is omitted because of our choice of C):</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">``` v0 = (a0 + a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 + a5)(b0 + b1 + b2 + b3 + b4 + b5) v2 = (a0 + a1 + a3 + a4)(b0 + b1 + b3 + b4) v3 = (a0 − a2 − a3 + a5)(b0 − b2 − b3 + b5) v4 = (a0 − a2 − a5)(b0 − b2 − b5) v5 = (a0 + a3 − a5)(b0 + b3 − b5) v6 = (a0 + a1 + a2)(b0 + b1 + b2) v7 = (a3 + a4 + a5)(b3 + b4 + b5) v8 = (a2 + a3)(b2 + b3) v9 = (a1 − a4)(b1 − b4) v10 = (a1 + a2)(b1 + b2) v11 = (a3 + a4)(b3 + b4) v12 = (a0 + a1)(b0 + b1) v13 = (a4 + a5)(b4 + b5) v14 = a0b0 v15 = a1b1 v16 = a4b4 v17 = a5b5, ```</p>

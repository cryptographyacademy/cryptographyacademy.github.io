    <p class="text-gray-300">Abstract. In a recent work, Kim and Barbulescu had extended the tower number field sieve algorithm to obtain improved asymptotic complexities in the medium prime case for the discrete logarithm problem on Fp&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; where n is not a prime power. Their method does not work when n is a composite prime power. For this case, we obtain new asymptotic complexities, e.g., Lp&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; (1/3,(64/9)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ) (resp. Lp&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; (1/3, 1.88) for the multiple number field variation) when n is composite and a power of 2; the previously best known complexity for this case is Lp&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; (1/3,(96/9)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ) (resp. Lp&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; (1/3, 2.12)). These complexities may have consequences to the selection of key sizes for pairing based cryptography. The new complexities are achieved through a general polynomial selection method. This method, which we call Algorithm-C, extends a previous polynomial selection method proposed at Eurocrypt 2016 to the tower number field case. As special cases, it is possible to obtain the generalised Joux-Lercier and the Conjugation method of polynomial selection proposed at Eurocrypt 2015 and the extension of these methods to the tower number field scenario by Kim and Barbulescu. A thorough analysis of the new algorithm is carried out in both concrete and asymptotic terms.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1 Introduction</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The discrete logarithm problem (DLP) over the multiplicative group of a finite field is a basic problem in cryptography. Two general approaches are known for tackling the DLP on such groups. These are the function field sieve (FFS) [1, 2, 12, 14] algorithm and the number field sieve (NFS) [8, 13, 15] algorithm.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let p be a prime, n ≥ 1 be an integer and Q = p &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;. Suppose that p = LQ(a, cp) where</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$L_Q(a, c_p) = \\exp((c_p + o(1))(\\ln Q)^a (\\ln \\ln Q)^{1-a}).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Depending of the value of a, fields F&lt;sup&gt;Q&lt;/sup&gt; are classified into the following types: small characteristic, if a ≤ 1/3; medium characteristic, if 1/3 &lt; a &lt; 2/3; boundary, if a = 2/3; and large characteristic, if a &gt; 2/3.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For fields of small characteristic, there has been tremendous progress in the FFS algorithm leading to a quasi-polynomial time algorithm [4]. Based on the FFS algorithms given in [11, 4], a record computation of discrete log in the binary extension field F&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;9234&lt;/sup&gt; was reported by Granger et al [9]. Applications of the FFS algorithm to the medium prime case have been reported in [14, 10, 19].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For medium to large characteristic finite fields, the NFS algorithm is generally considered to be the state-of-the-art. NFS was initially proposed for solving the factoring problem. Its application to DLP was first proposed by Gordon [8] for prime order fields. Application to composite order fields was shown by Schirokauer [21]. Important improvements to the NFS for prime order fields was given by Joux and Lercier [13].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A major step in the application of NFS was by Joux, Lercier, Smart and Vercauteren [15] who showed that the NFS algorithm is applicable to all finite fields. When the prime p is of a special form, Joux and Pierrot [16] showed the application of the special number field sieve algorithm to obtain improved complexity.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The NFS algorithm proceeds by constructing two polynomials f(x) and g(x) over the integers which have a common factor ϕ(x) of degree n modulo p. The polynomial ϕ(x) defines the field Fp&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; while the polynomials f(x) and g(x) define two number fields. The efficiency of the NFS algorithm is crucially dependent on the properties of the polynomials f(x) and g(x) used to construct the number fields. Consequently, polynomial selection is an important step in the NFS algorithm and is an active area of research.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">There has been a recent spurt of interest in the study of the NFS algorithm for DLP in finite fields. The work [3] by Barbulescu et al. extends a previous method [13] for polynomial selection and also presents a new method. The extension of [13] is called the generalised Joux-Lercier (GJL) method while the new method proposed in [3] is called the Conjugation method. The paper also provides a comprehensive comparison of the trade-offs in the complexity of the NFS algorithm offered by the various polynomial selection methods.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The NFS based algorithm has been extended to multiple number field sieve algorithm (MNFS). The work [6] showed the application of the MNFS to medium to high characteristic finite fields. More recently, Pierrot [18] proposed MNFS variants of the GJL and the Conjugation methods. Sarkar and Singh proposed [20] a new polynomial selection method which subsumes both the GJL and the Conjugation methods. Using this method, the asymptotic complexity of both the NFS and the MNFS were worked out in [20].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The minimum asymptotic complexities using the NFS algorithm of Barbulescu et al. [3] can be written as LQ(1/3,(c/9)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ) where c = 96 for the medium characteristic case; c = 48 for the boundary case and c = 64 for the large characteristic case. The multiple number field sieve algorithm [18] improves these complexities. Further, the minimum complexities are achievable for a certain value of cp. The analysis in [20] improves the asymptotic complexity of the boundary case for a range of values of cp.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">When the extension degree n is composite, the finite field Fp&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; can be represented as a tower of fields. The idea of using this in the context of DLP is due to Schirokauer [21]. This variant is called the tower number field sieve (TNFS) algorithm.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">At Asiacrypt 2015, Barbulescu et al., [5] presented a detailed analysis of the tower number field sieve (TNFS) variant. In a recent paper, Kim and Barbulescu [17] extended the TNFS algorithm and applied previous polynomial selection methods to the TNFS, the multiple TNFS (MTNFS) and the special TNFS variants. These were respectively called the exTNFS, MexTNFS and the SexTNFS algorithms. The polynomial selection methods considered in [17] include the methods from Joux-Lercier-Smart-Vercauteren [15], the GJL and the Conjugation methods from [3] and the polynomial selection method from [20].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Consequences to the medium prime case. An important achievement of the work by Kim and Barbulescu [17] is to improve the asymptotic complexity of the medium prime case when n is not a prime power. In this case, they show that the complexity  <span class="math">L_Q(1/3, (48/9)^{1/3})</span>  is achievable. Further, if p is of a special form, then the complexity of  <span class="math">L_Q(1/3, (32/9)^{1/3})</span>  is achievable. The condition n is not a prime power is equivalent to saying that n can be written as  <span class="math">\\eta \\kappa</span>  with  <span class="math">\\gcd(\\eta, \\kappa) = 1</span> . How restrictive is the condition  <span class="math">\\gcd(\\eta, \\kappa) = 1</span> ?</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One way of removing this restriction is to embed  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}</span>  into  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{nm}}</span>  with  <span class="math">\\gcd(n,m)=1</span>  and compute discrete logarithms in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{nm}}</span> . Let  <span class="math">Q=p^n</span>  and  <span class="math">Q&#x27;=p^{nm}</span> . The complexity of the NFS algorithm in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{Q&#x27;}</span>  can be written as  <span class="math">L_{Q&#x27;}(1/3,\\mu)</span>  where  <span class="math">\\mu</span>  is a constant. Note that  <span class="math">L_{Q&#x27;}(1/3,\\mu)</span>  is  <span class="math">L_Q(1/3,\\mu m^{1/3})</span>  (ignoring small terms). The best complexity obtained by Kim and Barbulescu is  <span class="math">\\mu=(48/9)^{1/3}</span> . So, the best complexity achieved for solving DLP in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}</span>  by embedding into  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{nm}}</span>  is  <span class="math">L_Q(1/3,\\nu)</span>  where  <span class="math">\\nu=(48m/9)^{1/3}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since  <span class="math">m \\geq 2</span> ,  <span class="math">\\nu \\geq (96/9)^{1/3}</span> . For  <span class="math">p = L_Q(a, c_p)</span>  with 1/3 &lt; a &lt; 2/3, the complexity of NFS for directly solving DLP in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}</span>  is  <span class="math">L_Q(1/3, (96/9)^{1/3})</span> . So, we see that trying to solve DLP in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}</span>  by embedding into a larger field increases the complexity. This motivates the problem of finding a variant of NFS for fields  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}</span>  where n is a composite prime-power with complexity  <span class="math">L_Q(1/3, \\nu)</span>  with  <span class="math">\\nu &lt; (96/9)^{1/3}</span> .</p>

    <h4 id="sec-2" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>Our Contributions</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This paper makes two contributions.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The first contribution is to present a general polynomial selection method which we call Algorithm- <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}</span> . The polynomial selection method of [20] can be obtained as a special case and so, in turn, the GJL and the Conjugation methods are also obtained as special cases. Further, the exTNFS variants of the GJL and the Conjugation methods are also obtained as special cases of Algorithm- <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One important feature of Algorithm- <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}</span>  is that both prime-power and non prime-power n can be covered. For the medium prime case, we have the following consequences.</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>For non prime-power n, the minimum complexity achievable is that obtained by Kim and Barbulescu [17]. The analysis, however, reveals improvement</li>

      <li>For composite prime-power n, the complexities achieved by the new polynomial selection method are currently the best known.

    <h3 id="sec-7" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5.1 Plots of Norm Bounds</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Figure 1, we provide plots of norm bound for various finite fields of composite prime power extension degree. It is clear from the plots that for composite prime power extension degree, the algorithm-C provides the lowest norm bound. Note that we have used the estimates of Q-E pairs given in the Table 2 of the paper [3] for plotting these norm bound.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Plots of norm bound for extension degrees 12 and 24 are given in the Figure 2. Note that for these extension degrees, two types of towers are possible; one for which gcd(η, κ) = 1, and the other for which gcd(η, κ) 6= 1. Let us denote by Algorithm-B, the special case of Algorithm-C where λ = 1 and so gcd(η, κ) = 1. Plots for Algorithm-B are shown separately in Figures 2. It is interesting to note that, in the certain range of finite fields, the minimum norm bound achieved by Algorithm-C is lower than the minimum norm bound achieved by Algorithm-B, i.e., it is not necessarily the best to choose gcd(η, κ) = 1. While this appears in the concrete comparison, it is not captured by the asymptotic analysis.</p>

This plot extends a similar plot provided in [20] for the case η = 1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Case λ = η &gt; 1: For a fixed k, increasing r leads to increase in the value of (25) which shows that this expression is minimised for the minimum value of r which is r = k. Setting r = k, and using λ = η, (25) becomes</p>

    <h3 id="sec-10" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">7 Multiple Number Field Sieve Variant</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the multiple number field sieve (MNFS) algorithm, several number fields are considered. These number fields are generated by the irreducible polynomials in R[x], having a common irreducible factor over Fp&lt;sup&gt;η&lt;/sup&gt; . There are two variants of MNFS algorithm. We discuss the second variant of MNFS only where the image of φ(x) needs to be smooth in the first number field and at least one of the other V number fields.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Methods for obtaining the collection of number fields for MNFS algorithm have been mentioned in [18]. We adapt one of these methods to our setting. Note that the Algorithm  <span class="math">\\mathcal C</span>  produces two polynomials f(x) and g(x) of degrees d(r+1) and dr respectively. The polynomial g(x) is defined as  <span class="math">\\mathrm{Res}_y(\\psi(y), C_0(x) + yC_1(x))</span>  where  <span class="math">\\psi(x) = \\mathrm{LLL}(M_{A_2,r})</span> , i.e.,  <span class="math">\\psi(x)</span>  is defined from the first row of the matrix obtained after applying the LLL-algorithm to  <span class="math">M_{A_2,r}</span> . We use f(x) for constructing the first number field. Let  <span class="math">g_1(x) = g(x)</span>  and  <span class="math">g_2(x) = \\mathrm{Res}_y(\\psi_2(y), C_0(x) + yC_1(x))</span> , where  <span class="math">\\psi_2(x)</span>  is the polynomial defined from the second row of the matrix  <span class="math">M_{A_2,r}</span> . For  <span class="math">i=3,\\ldots,V</span> , we consider  <span class="math">g_i(x)=s_ig_1(x)+t_ig_2(x)</span>  where the coefficients  <span class="math">s_i</span>  and  <span class="math">t_i</span>  are of the size of  <span class="math">\\sqrt{V}</span> . These  <span class="math">g_i(x)</span>  are used for constructing the other V number fields.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Clearly the  <span class="math">g_i</span> 's have degree dr. Asymptotically, we have  <span class="math">\\|\\psi_2\\|_{\\infty} = \\|\\psi_1\\|_{\\infty} = Q^{1/(d(r+1))}</span> . If we choose  <span class="math">V = L_Q(1/3)</span> , all the  <span class="math">g_i</span> 's have their infinity norms given by Proposition 1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let B and B' be the bounds on the norms of the ideals which are in the factor basis defined by f and each of  <span class="math">g_i</span> 's respectively. So, the size of the entire factor basis is B + VB'. We further use the following condition to balances the factor basis.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$B = VB&#x27;. (28)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With this condition, the size of the factor basis is  <span class="math">B^{1+o(1)}</span>  and so asymptotically, the linear algebra step takes time  <span class="math">B^2</span> . Similar to the analysis of NFS variant, the number of sieving polynomials is  <span class="math">E^2</span>  and the coefficient polynomials of  <span class="math">\\phi(x)</span>  can take  <span class="math">E^{2/t}</span>  distinct values. Since we require that the cost of relation collection should be same as the cost of linear algebra, we have  <span class="math">E^2 = B^2</span>  i.e., E = B.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As before, let  <span class="math">\\pi</span>  be the probability that a random sieving polynomial  <span class="math">\\phi(x)</span>  gives rise to a relation. Let  <span class="math">\\pi_1</span>  be the probability that  <span class="math">\\phi(x)</span>  is smooth over the factor basis for the first number field and  <span class="math">\\pi_2</span>  be the probability that  <span class="math">\\phi(x)</span>  is smooth over at least one of the other V factor bases. Further, let  <span class="math">\\Gamma_1 = \\operatorname{Res}_x(f(x), \\phi(x))</span>  be the bound on the norm corresponding to the first number field and  <span class="math">\\Gamma_2 = \\operatorname{Res}_x(g_i(x), \\phi(x))</span>  be the bound on the norm for any of the other number fields. Recall that  <span class="math">\\Gamma_2</span>  is determined only by the degree and the  <span class="math">L_{\\infty}</span> -norm of  <span class="math">g_i(x)</span>  and hence is the same for all  <span class="math">g_i(x)</span> 's. Heuristically, we have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\pi_1 = \\Psi(\\Gamma_1, B);</span>$
<span class="math">\\pi_2 = V\\Psi(\\Gamma_2, B&#x27;);</span>
<span class="math">\\pi = \\pi_1 \\times \\pi_2.</span>
(29)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One relation is obtained in about  <span class="math">\\pi^{-1}</span>  trials and so total number of relations obtained after sieving would be  <span class="math">E^2\\pi</span>  and this should be equal to B for linear algebra step to go through. Hence we have, as before,  <span class="math">B=E=\\pi^{-1}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The following choices of B and V are made.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$E = B = L_Q(\\frac{1}{3}, c_b);</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Theorem 2. Let n = ηκ; p = LQ(a, cp) with 1/3 &lt; a &lt; 2/3; and η = cη(ln Q/ln ln Q) 2/3−a . It is possible to ensure that the runtime of the MNFS algorithm is LQ(1/3, 2cb) where</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof. For a sieving polynomial φ,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\begin{split} &amp;\\Gamma_{1} = N(\\phi, f) = E^{2d(r+1)/t} L_{Q}(2/3, o(1)) \\\\ &amp;= L_{Q}(2/3, (2c_{b}(r+1))/(c_{\\theta}kt)); \\\\ &amp;\\pi_{1}^{-1} = L_{Q}(1/3, 2(r+1)/(3c_{\\theta}kt)); \\\\ &amp;\\Gamma_{2} = N(\\phi, g) = E^{2dr/t} \\times Q^{(t-1)\\varepsilon/\\kappa} L_{Q}(2/3, o(1)) \\\\ &amp;= L_{Q}(2/3, 2c_{b}r/(c_{\\theta}kt) + (t-1)c_{\\theta}\\varepsilon); \\\\ &amp;\\pi_{2}^{-1} = L_{Q}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}, -c_{v} + \\frac{1}{3(c_{b} - c_{v})} \\left(\\frac{2c_{b}r}{c_{\\theta}kt} + (t-1)c_{\\theta}\\varepsilon\\right)\\right); \\\\ &amp;\\pi^{-1} = L_{Q}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2(r+1)}{3c_{\\theta}kt} - c_{v} + \\frac{1}{3(c_{b} - c_{v})} \\left(\\frac{2c_{b}r}{c_{\\theta}kt} + (t-1)c_{\\theta}\\varepsilon\\right)\\right); \\end{split}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">From the condition π &lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = B, we obtain the following equation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$c_b = \\frac{2(r+1)}{3c_\\theta kt} - c_v + \\frac{1}{3(c_b - c_v)} \\left( \\frac{2c_b r}{c_\\theta kt} + (t-1)c_\\theta \\varepsilon \\right). \\tag{32}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Simplifying, we obtain</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$3c_{\\theta}kt(c_b^2 - c_v^2) = 2(2r+1)c_b - 2(r+1)c_v + (t-1)c_{\\theta}^2\\varepsilon kt.</span>$
(33)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We wish to find c&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt; such that c&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; is minimised subject to the constraint (33). Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, the partial derivative of (33) with respect to c&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt; gives</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$c_v = \\frac{(r+1)}{3c_\\theta kt}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using this value of c&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt; in (33) provides the following quadratic in cb.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Solving this and taking the positive square root, we obtain the expression for c&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; given by (31). ut</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Fig. 4. Complexity plots for the medium prime case using the MexTNFS algorithm.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To find the absolute minimum complexity, we need to minimise the expression for  <span class="math">c_b</span>  given by (31) with respect to  <span class="math">c_{\\theta}</span> . The standard way of doing this is to differentiate with respect to  <span class="math">c_{\\theta}</span>  and set to 0 to find the value of  <span class="math">c_{\\theta}</span>  for which the minimum value of  <span class="math">c_b</span>  is attained. Differentiating the right hand side of (31) with respect to  <span class="math">c_{\\theta}</span>  and setting to 0 yields (after some simplifications) a quadratic in  <span class="math">c_{\\theta}^3</span>  which can be solved to obtain:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$c_{\\theta}^{3} = \\frac{2}{3\\varepsilon k^{2}t^{2}(t-1)} \\cdot \\left(4r^{2} + 9r + 1 + \\sqrt{7r^{2} + 16r + 1}\\right). \\tag{34}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Substituting the value of  <span class="math">c_{\\theta}</span>  in (31) provides the expression for the corresponding value of  <span class="math">2c_b</span>  in terms of t, r, k and  <span class="math">\\lambda</span> . For each value of  <span class="math">\\lambda</span> , we wish to obtain the minimum possible value of  <span class="math">2c_b</span> . This is achieved with t=2 and r=k. The actual value of r depends on the value of r for r the minimum value of r is r 1.71 and is achieved for r 1; for r 2 the minimum value of r 3 the minimum value of r 3 the minimum value of r 3 the minimum value of r 3 the minimum value of r 3 the minimum value of r 3 the minimum value of r 3 the minimum value of r 3 the minimum value of r 3 the minimum value of r 3 the minimum value of r 4.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The variation of  <span class="math">2c_b</span>  with  <span class="math">c_\\theta</span>  is more complex. Figure 4 shows these plots for various values of  <span class="math">\\lambda</span> . From [17], the complexities for the medium characteristic case, the large characteristic case and the best complexity for the boundary case are respectively  <span class="math">L_Q(1/3, 2.12)</span> ,  <span class="math">L_Q(1/3, 1.90)</span>  and  <span class="math">L_Q(1/3, 1.71)</span> . For composite prime-power n, these are the previously known best known complexities for these</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">cases. To make the comparison of the new complexities easier, Figure 4 shows the lines for 2.12, 1.90 and 1.71.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper, we have presented a new polynomial selection method for exTNFS algorithm. The new polynomial selection method subsumes GJL, Conjugation and Sarkar-Singh polynomial selection methods. The exTNFS algorithm combined with new polynomial selection method provides new asymptotic complexities for the extension fields with composite prime power extension degrees.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">In the past two years there have been several advances in Number Field Sieve (NFS) algorithms for computing discrete logarithms in finite fields $\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ where $p$ is prime and $n &gt; 1$ is a small integer. This article presents a concise overview of these algorithms and discusses some of the challenges with assessing their impact on keylengths for pairing-based cryptosystems.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">1 Introduction</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A cryptographic pairing is a non-degenerate bilinear map  <span class="math">\\hat{e}: \\mathbb{G}_1 \\times \\mathbb{G}_2 \\to \\mathbb{G}_T</span> , where  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1</span> ,  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span> ,  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_T</span>  are groups of the same prime order r. The pairing is symmetric if  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1 = \\mathbb{G}_2</span> ; otherwise it is asymmetric. Such pairings are generally constructed from elliptic curves E defined over a finite field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  and having low embedding degree n. For symmetric pairings,  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  is either a characteristic-two or characteristic-three field (with n=4 or n=6) or a prime field (with n=2). For asymmetric pairings,  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  is a prime field and n is small, e.g.,  <span class="math">n \\in \\{2, 6, 12, 18, 24\\}</span> . Here,  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span>  are order-r groups of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q^n</span> -rational points on E,  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_T</span>  is the order-r subgroup of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q^n</span> , and the map  <span class="math">\\hat{e}</span>  is derived from the Weil or Tate pairings.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Beginning in 2001 when Boneh and Franklin proposed their identity-based encryption scheme [11], pairings have become an indispensable instrument in the cryptographer's toolbox. Hundreds (if not thousands) of research papers have been written that use pairings to design protocols that achieve certain cryptographic or efficiency objectives that do not seem attainable with conventional cryptosystems such as RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). Among these applications are aggregate signature schemes, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof systems, certificateless encryption, attribute-based encryption, and searchable encryption.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A vast majority of research papers on pairing-based protocols treat the underlying pairing  <span class="math">\\hat{e}</span>  as a black box, and emphasize reductionist security proofs for the protocols with respect to some hardness assumption on  <span class="math">\\hat{e}</span> . An unfortunate consequence of this predominant point of view is that issues with functionality, efficiency and security of the pairing-based protocols have not been given the attention they deserve sometimes leading to misleading or incorrect claims. For example, beginning with the BLS signature scheme [12], many papers described protocols using so-called Type-2 asymmetric pairings whereby  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1 \\neq \\mathbb{G}_2</span>  and an efficiently-computable isomorphism  <span class="math">\\psi</span>  from  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span>  to  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1</span>  is known. However, a concrete analysis subsequently revealed that Type 2 pairings are inferior to their Type 3 counterparts with respect to functionality, efficiency and security, and therefore there is no reason to use them [14] (see also [15]). As a second example, consider the Boneh-Shacham group signature scheme with asymmetric pairings  <span class="math">\\hat{e}: \\mathbb{G}_1 \\times \\mathbb{G}_2 \\to \\mathbb{G}_T</span>  in which</p>

r(z) = 36z^4 + 36z^3 + 18z^2 + 6z + 1, t(z) = 6z^2 + 1

    <p class="text-gray-300">one needs to hash onto  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span>  and thereafter apply  <span class="math">\\psi</span>  to the resulting hash value [13]. This protocol, although 'provably secure', is not implementable since no construction of such a pairing is known. As a third example, we mention the bewildering array of contrived hardness assumptions that have been proposed in the literature in order to attain a reductionist security proof (see [32]). It is typically easy to prove that these assumptions are valid in the generic group model. However, their validity in practice is much more difficult to ascertain. Indeed, Cheon [16] showed that the so-called Strong Diffie-Hellman (SDH) problem that had been formulated by Boneh and Boyen [10] can be solved significantly faster than previous believed. Shortly after, Jao and Yoshida [24] showed that Cheon's SDH solver could be used to forge signatures for the Boneh-Boyen signature scheme.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">More recently, confidence in the security of pairing-based protocols has been shaken because of spectacular advances in algorithms for solving the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_T</span> , a problem whose intractability is necessary for the security of <em>all</em> pairing-based protocols. Most astonishingly, the DLP in small-characteristic finite fields can now be solved in quasi-polynomial time [3], thereby rendering insecure all protocols that use symmetric pairings derived from elliptic and hyperelliptic curves over small-characteristic finite fields. Moreover, numerous improvements to the Number Field Sieve for computing discrete logarithms in fields  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}</span>  where p is prime and n &gt; 1 is small have been proposed [4,31], thereby appearing to decrease the security of popular asymmetric pairings including those derived from Barreto-Naehrig (BN) elliptic curves [8].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The purpose of this paper is to initiate an examination of the impact of the aforementioned NFS improvements on keylengths for protocols that employ asymmetric pairings. Of special interest are parameters for BN [8], BLS12 [7], KSS [30] and BLS24 [7] pairings that achieve the 128-bit and 192-bit security levels in light of the new DLP attacks. Table 1 lists the important parameters for these families of elliptic curves. All elliptic curves E are defined over a prime field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> . The group order  <span class="math">\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_p) = p+1-t</span>  is divisible by a prime r, and we set  <span class="math">\\rho = \\log p/\\log r</span> . In order to achieve the  <span class="math">\\ell</span> -bit security level, one must select the parameter z so that the bitlength of r is at least  <span class="math">2\\ell</span>  (in order to resist Pollard's rho attack [36] on the DLP in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1</span> ), and so that the bitlength of  <span class="math">p^n</span>  is sufficiently large to resist NFS attacks on the DLP in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}^*</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We find that the published analyses of the NFS algorithms are inherently asymptotic in nature, and that much more work remains to be done before the impact on keylengths can be determined with full confidence. In the meantime, implementers who wish to deploy pairing-based protocols are advised to make conservative parameter choices that ignore hidden constants in the running times of the NFS algorithms. Note that these hidden constants (most likely) have the effect of multiplying</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">the running time by at least 1, so ignoring them results in an underestimation of the NFS running times.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In &sect;2 we give some examples of the difficulties and limitations of interpreting asymptotic results in practice. Concise overviews of the NFS and the Tower Number Field Sieve (TNFS) and their derivatives are presented in &sect;3 and &sect;4. In &sect;5, we identify some hidden constants in the asymptotic analysis of the TNFS. The combined effect of these hidden constants is difficult to ascertain but can have a significant impact on the concrete running time of the algorithm. In &sect;6, we consider the effect of one such constant, namely the constant that arises in the expression for the upper bound of the norm. Translating the effect of this constant into concrete running times yields several interesting observations on the practical efficiency of the algorithms. We make some concluding remarks in &sect;7.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">2 Pitfalls in Asymptotic Analysis</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This section gives some examples of the difficulties and limitations of interpreting asymptotic results in practice.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-2.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2.1 Integer Factorization</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The NFS for factoring integers N has running time L<sup>N</sup> ( 1 3 , 1.923) [33]. Here, L<sup>N</sup> (a, c) with 0 &lt; a &lt; 1 and c &gt; 0 denotes the expression</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$O\\left(\\exp\\left((c+o(1))(\\log N)^a(\\log\\log N)^{1-a}\\right)\\right) \\tag{1}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">that is subexponential in log N<sup>1</sup> . This running time expression hides a multiplicative constant. Moreover, an exact formula for the o(1) term in the exponent is not known.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the 1990's, there was considerable debate in standards forums about the RSA keylengths that were needed to ensure long-term security against NFS attacks. While experiments with factoring medium-sized N were being conducted, there was no consensus on how to scale the experimental results to large-sized N. In addition, the NFS has large storage needs and requires a large amount of RAM in order to perform sieving efficiently. Thus, since it is difficult to predict the cost and speed of hardware many years into the future, it was difficult to assess the true cost of running the NFS on large-sized N. Nonetheless, consensus was reached that the conservative approach to determining security levels for RSA would be to use the running time of the NFS as the sole measure. RSA keylength estimates that were made 15 years ago have survived with no changes. In particular, it has become widely accepted that RSA with moduli of bitlengths 1024, 2048, 3072, 7680, 15360, offers security levels of 80, 112, 128, 192, 256 bits, respectively [6].</p>

      <h3 id="sec-2.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2.2 Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For any fixed n &ge; 4, the Gaudry-Hess-Smart (GHS) Weil descent attack [21] for solving the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) in elliptic curves over characteristic-two finite fields Fq<sup>n</sup> has running time</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$O(q^{2+\\epsilon})</span>$
as  <span class="math">q \\to \\infty</span> . (2)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>1</sup> In this paper, log N and lg N are the logarithms of N to the base e and 2, respectively.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Consider the case of elliptic curves E over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{163}}</span>  where  <span class="math">\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{2^{163}})</span>  is twice a prime. Pollard's rho attack takes time  <span class="math">2^{81}</span>  to compute logarithms in  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_{2^{163}})</span> . One would expect that the GHS attack is not applicable since q=2 is small. On the other hand, if one ignores the hidden constant and the  <span class="math">\\epsilon</span>  term in (2) then one might conclude that by embedding  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{163}}</span>  in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{25\\cdot 163}}</span>  (where we now have  <span class="math">q=2^{25}</span>  and n=163), the GHS attack would take time approximately  <span class="math">2^{50}</span>  and thus would be significantly faster than Pollard's rho method. However, the running time expression (2) hides a very bad dependency on n, namely a multiplicative constant  <span class="math">2^n</span> !. For n=163,  <span class="math">2^n</span> !  <span class="math">\\approx 2^{2^{170}}</span>  which makes it clear that the GHS attack is completely impractical for computing logarithms in elliptic curves over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{163}}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As another example, we mention Diem's striking result [18] (see also [19]). Let a and b be fixed positive real numbers with a &lt; b. Then Diem proved that discrete logarithms in the group of rational points on any elliptic curve defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^n}</span>  with  <span class="math">a \\cdot \\sqrt{\\log q} \\le n \\le b \\cdot \\sqrt{\\log q}</span>  can be solved in subexponential time</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$e^{O((\\log q^n)^{2/3})}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Now, a subexponential-time algorithm for solving the ECDLP could have devastating consequences for the security of conventional ECC whose <em>raison d'&ecirc;tre</em> is the belief that the fastest algorithm for solving the ECDLP is Pollard's rho method which takes fully exponential time. However, Diem's algorithm is inherently asymptotic and it is generally accepted that it does not pose a threat to the security of ECC in practice where elliptic curves over prime fields or over prime-degree extensions of the field of two elements are employed.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-2.3" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2.3 Indistinguishability Obfuscation</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In 2013, Garg et al. [20] gave the first provably-secure construction for a polynomial-time indistinguishability obfuscator. The security proof was for all polynomial-time adversaries under certain assumptions on the underlying cryptographic primitives. However, a concrete analysis undertaken by Mayo [34] highlighted the asymptotic nature of the scheme and its impracticality. Mayo considered the obfuscation of a circuit of depth  <span class="math">\\ell^3</span>  and size  <span class="math">\\ell^5</span> , where  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  denotes the security parameter. When the Coron-Lepoint-Tibouchi multilinear map [17] is employed in the Garg et al. obfuscator, the size of the obfuscated circuit for  <span class="math">\\ell=128</span>  was estimated to be at least  <span class="math">2^{1357}</span>  bits. Thus, even though the Garg et al. obfuscator was provably secure and efficient within the &quot;polynomial-time&quot; paradigm, it is hopelessly impractical.</p>

    <section id="sec-3" class="mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">3 Overview of the Number Field Sieve</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let p be a prime,  <span class="math">n \\ge 1</span> , and  <span class="math">Q = p^n</span> . Suppose that p is written as  <span class="math">p = L_Q(a, c_p)</span>  for real numbers  <span class="math">a, c_p &gt; 0</span> . Depending on the value of a, finite fields  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_Q</span>  are classified into the following types: small characteristic if  <span class="math">a \\le 1/3</span> ; medium characteristic if 1/3 &lt; a &lt; 2/3; boundary if a = 2/3; and large characteristic if a &gt; 2/3.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For small-characteristic finite fields, there has been tremendous progress in the discrete logarithm computation. The approach has been based on the function field sieve algorithm and asymptotically the fastest known algorithm runs in quasi-polynomial time [3].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the other classes of finite fields, i.e., those with medium to large characteristic, the Number Field Sieve is presently the state-of-the-art. The NFS was initially proposed for integer factorization [33]. Application of the NFS to DLP computation was first proposed by Gordon [22] who considered</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">prime-order fields. Extensions to composite-order fields were made by Schirokauer [41]. For the case of prime-order fields, improvements were made by Joux and Lercier [27]. Joux, Lercier, Smart and Vercauteren [28] showed that the NFS is applicable to all finite fields. For fields where the prime p is of a special form, Joux and Pierrot [29] applied the special NFS to obtain improved complexity.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The NFS is an index-calculus algorithm having three main phases: (i) relation collection, (ii) linear algebra, and (iii) individual logarithm. Asymptotically, the times for the relation collection and the linear algebra phases dominate the time for the individual logarithm phase. The parameters are tuned so that the time for the relation collection phase is equal to the time for the linear algebra phase and this time is the asymptotic run time of the NFS.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Two number fields  <span class="math">\\mathbb{K}_f = \\mathbb{Q}[x]/(f)</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{K}_g = \\mathbb{Q}[x]/(g)</span>  are defined by choosing irreducible polynomials f(x) and g(x) over the integers. The required condition on f(x) and g(x) is that modulo p they have a common irreducible factor  <span class="math">\\varphi(x)</span>  of degree n over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> . The field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}</span>  is represented by  <span class="math">\\varphi(x)</span> . Let  <span class="math">\\gamma</span>  be a generator of the multiplicative group of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{C}</span>  and  <span class="math">m \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^n}</span>  be roots of f(x), g(x) and  <span class="math">\\varphi(x)</span>  respectively. The commutative diagram given in Figure 1 shows two homomorphisms  <span class="math">\\mathbb{K}_f \\to \\mathbb{F}_{p^n}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{K}_g \\to \\mathbb{F}_{p^n}</span>  given by  <span class="math">\\alpha \\mapsto m</span>  and  <span class="math">\\beta \\mapsto m</span>  respectively. This diagram explains the basic working of the NFS.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">    <img src="_page_4_Figure_4.jpeg" alt="" class="my-4 max-w-full" />
</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Fig. 1. The basic principle of NFS.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Instead of working over the whole number fields  <span class="math">\\mathbb{K}_f</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{K}_g</span> , one works over the corresponding rings of integers  <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}_f</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}_g</span> . The notion of norm of ideals allows one to define a suitable factor base, namely the prime ideals of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}_f</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}_g</span> , whose norms are at most some pre-specified smoothness bound B. The size of the factor base is  <span class="math">B^{1+o(1)}</span> , where B is chosen so as to balance the times for relation collection and linear algebra.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To generate relations, polynomials  <span class="math">\\phi \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]</span>  of degree at most t-1 are considered. If the principal ideals  <span class="math">\\phi(\\alpha)\\mathcal{O}_f</span>  and  <span class="math">\\phi(\\beta)\\mathcal{O}_g</span>  are B-smooth, then such a  <span class="math">\\phi</span>  yields a relation among the factor base elements. Formally, a relation is actually a linear relation between the discrete logarithms of certain elements of the field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}</span> . Such discrete logarithms are called virtual logarithms<sup>2</sup>. The number of relations collected is a little more than B. This allows carrying out the linear algebra phase to compute the virtual logarithms of the factor base elements. The individual logarithm phase consists of finding the discrete logarithm of some element  <span class="math">h \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^n}</span> . The task in this phase is to find an element of the form  <span class="math">h^i \\gamma^j</span>  such that the principal ideal generated by the preimage of  <span class="math">h^i \\gamma^j</span>  in  <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}_f</span>  factors into prime ideals of degrees at most t-1 and bounded norms. Then the special-q technique is used to express the desired discrete logarithm in terms of the virtual discrete logarithms of factor</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;2</sup> The details are complicated and involve using the homomorphisms  <span class="math">\\alpha \\mapsto m</span>  and  <span class="math">\\beta \\mapsto m</span>  along with the class numbers and the torsion-free ranks of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}_f</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}_g</span> . We skip these details.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">base elements. Since these virtual discrete logarithms have already been computed, it is possible to finally obtain the desired discrete logarithm. We refer to [2] for more details on the relation collection phase and to [23] for the individual discrete logarithm phase.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-3.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.1 Polynomial Selection and Sizes of Norms</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The crucial step in relation collection is to obtain  <span class="math">\\phi \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]</span>  such that the ideals  <span class="math">\\phi(\\alpha)\\mathcal{O}_f</span>  and  <span class="math">\\phi(\\beta)\\mathcal{O}_g</span>  are both smooth. For ensuring this smoothness, it is sufficient to ensure that their norms, i.e.,  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Res}(f,\\phi)</span>  and  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Res}(g,\\phi)</span> , are both B-smooth, where Res denotes the resultant. Let E be such that the coefficients of  <span class="math">\\phi</span>  are in  <span class="math">\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}E^{2/t},\\frac{1}{2}E^{2/t}\\right]</span> , whence  <span class="math">\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty}\\approx E^{2/t}</span>  and the number of polynomials  <span class="math">\\phi</span>  that are considered for sieving is  <span class="math">E^2</span> . Here, the  <span class="math">\\ell_{\\infty}</span>  norm  <span class="math">\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty}</span>  of the polynomial  <span class="math">\\phi</span>  is the maximum of the absolute values of the coefficients of  <span class="math">\\phi</span> . For  <span class="math">p=L_Q(a,c_p)</span>  with  <span class="math">a&gt;\\frac{1}{3}</span> , the following can be shown (a more precise bound is provided later in the context of the TNFS):</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$|\\operatorname{Res}(f,\\phi)| = O\\left(\\left(\\|f\\|_{\\infty}\\right)^{t-1} E^{2(\\deg f)/t}\\right) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad |\\operatorname{Res}(g,\\phi)| = O\\left(\\left(\\|g\\|_{\\infty}\\right)^{t-1} E^{2(\\deg g)/t}\\right), \\quad (3)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">yielding the norm bound</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$|\\operatorname{Res}(f,\\phi) \\times \\operatorname{Res}(g,\\phi)| = O\\left( \\left( \\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\|g\\|_{\\infty} \\right)^{t-1} E^{(\\deg f + \\deg g)2/t} \\right). \\tag{4}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The probability of B-smoothness of the product of norms (4) determines the cost of obtaining a single relation and hence the cost of relation collection. A suitable choice of B is made to balance this cost with the cost of the linear algebra step. Thus the value of the product of norms in (4) is crucial for determining the overall run time of the algorithm.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that the norm bound is determined by the degrees of f and g and their  <span class="math">\\ell_{\\infty}</span>  norms. So, to ensure that the norm bound is small, it is required that the degrees and  <span class="math">\\ell_{\\infty}</span>  norms of f and g are small. Ensuring both of these is a very difficult problem. In the literature several methods for polynomial selection have been proposed which provide polynomials with different trade-offs between degrees and  <span class="math">\\ell_{\\infty}</span>  norms. We briefly describe some of the important ones next.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>JLSV1</strong> [28].

Choose a random positive integer  <span class="math">\\delta</span>  which is slightly greater than  <span class="math">\\lceil \\sqrt{p} \\rceil</span>  and let (u, v) be a rational reconstruction of  <span class="math">\\delta</span>  modulo p, i.e.,  <span class="math">\\delta \\equiv u/v \\pmod{p}</span> .

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">4 Overview of the Tower Number Field Sieve</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The Tower Number Field Sieve (TNFS) algorithm was initially considered by Schirokauer [41] and was revisited by Barbulescu et al. [4]. The implications of this algorithm for improving the complexity of the medium prime case were pointed out by Kim and Barbulescu [31] which has led to several follow-up works [38, 39]. Following [31] we denote these algorithms by 'extended TNFS' (exTNFS).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As we saw in &sect;3.2, the Conjugation method from [2] resulted in the NFS complexity of the boundary case being smaller than the complexity of the medium prime case. Suppose that the extension degree n is composite and n = &eta;&kappa; is a non-trivial factorization of n. Then Fp<sup>n</sup> has a tower field representation F<sup>q</sup> <sup>&kappa;</sup> , where q = p &eta; . The main idea behind the complexity reduction for the medium prime case using a tower field representation is the following. If p and Q = p <sup>n</sup> are such that  <span class="math">p = L_Q(a, c_p)</span>  for 1/3 &lt; a &lt; 2/3, then one can translate the problem to that of computing DLP in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^\\kappa}</span>  where  <span class="math">q = L_Q(2/3, c_q)</span> . This corresponds to the boundary case and so one benefits from the lower complexity of the boundary case for the medium prime case.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Here q is not prime and the characteristic of the field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_Q</span>  remains p irrespective of how the field is represented. Hence, strictly speaking, it is not correct to say that the medium characteristic case transforms to the boundary case. On the other hand, from the complexity point of view what matters are the norms of the polynomials and in that sense it is possible to obtain smaller norm bounds with the tower field representation than what could be done directly.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The basic idea of the exTNFS algorithm is the following. One starts with a monic polynomial h(z) of degree  <span class="math">\\eta</span>  which is irreducible over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  and hence is also irreducible over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}</span> . Let  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{\\eta}} = \\mathbb{F}_p[z]/(h(z))</span>  and  <span class="math">R = \\mathbb{Z}[z]/(h(z))</span> . Suppose f and g are polynomials in R[x] whose leading coefficients are from  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}</span> . It is required that both f and g are irreducible over R (this can be verified by testing irreducibility over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}[z]/(h(z))</span> ) and over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{\\eta}}</span> , and that f and g have a degree- <span class="math">\\kappa</span>  common factor  <span class="math">\\varphi(x)</span>  that is irreducible over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{\\eta}}</span> . The field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}</span>  is then realized as  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{\\eta}}[x]/(\\varphi(x)) = (R/pR)[x]/(\\varphi(x))</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">\\mathbb{K}_f</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{K}_g</span>  be the number fields defined by f and g respectively. As in the case of the NFS (see Figure 1), the above set-up provides two different decompositions of a homomorphism from R[x] to  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}</span> . One of these goes through R[x]/(f(x)) and the other goes through R[x]/(g(x)). Using this set-up it is possible to define a factor base and carry out the three main phases of NFS. Here also, the factor base consists of  <span class="math">B^{1+o(1)}</span>  elements for some smoothness bound B.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Sieving for relation collection is done using polynomials  <span class="math">\\phi \\in R[x]</span>  of degrees at most t-1 with  <span class="math">\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty} = E^{2/\\eta t}</span>  so that the number of sieving polynomials is  <span class="math">E^2</span> . A sieving polynomial  <span class="math">\\phi \\in R[x]</span>  generates a relation if both the norms</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$N(\\phi, f) = \\operatorname{Res}_{z}(\\operatorname{Res}_{x}(\\phi(x), f(x)), h(z)) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad N(\\phi, g) = \\operatorname{Res}_{z}(\\operatorname{Res}_{x}(\\phi(x), g(x)), h(z)) \\tag{6}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">are B-smooth. Note that in this case, f and g can be viewed as bivariate polynomials in x and z and hence the norm is obtained by taking resultants twice. Bounds on the norm are obtained from the bounds on resultants of bivariate polynomials [9].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The polynomial selection methods for NFS (see &sect;3.1) translate to the exTNFS setting. Instead of providing the details of these methods, we provide a summary of recent work with a focus on the medium prime case.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Kim and Barbulescu [31]. This work chooses  <span class="math">f, g \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]</span> , whence the degree- <span class="math">\\kappa</span>  polynomial  <span class="math">\\varphi(x) = \\gcd(f(x), g(x))</span>  is over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> . The requirement that  <span class="math">\\varphi(x)</span>  is irreducible over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}</span>  imposes the condition that  <span class="math">\\gcd(\\eta, \\kappa) = 1</span> . Hence, the Kim-Barbulescu method works only for composite non prime-power values of n. The actual polynomial selection is done using a translated version of the Conjugation method, resulting in the best achievable complexity for  <span class="math">p = L_Q(a, c_p)</span> , 1/3 &lt; a &lt; 2/3 to be  <span class="math">L_Q(1/3, (48/9)^{1/3})</span> . This complexity, however, is not achieved for all values of p.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Sarkar and Singh [38]. This work described a polynomial selection method (called Algorithm-C) in which the coefficients f and g are in R (and not necessarily in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}</span> ), with the restriction that f is monic and the leading coefficient of g is in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}</span> . As a result, the restriction that  <span class="math">\\varphi(x)</span>  has coefficients in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  is also removed resulting in the removal of the  <span class="math">\\gcd(\\eta, \\kappa) = 1</span>  constraint. This leads to a variant of the TNFS algorithm for the medium characteristic case with improved complexity for all composite n. For prime-power n, however, the minimum complexity obtained in [38] is larger than  <span class="math">L_Q(1/3, (48/9)^{1/3})</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Jeong and Kim [25].</strong> The Conjugation method was extended to the TNFS setting where the condition  <span class="math">gcd(\\eta, \\kappa) = 1</span>  was not required. The best achievable complexity for  <span class="math">p = L_Q(a, c_p)</span> , 1/3 &lt; a &lt; 2/3 was shown to be  <span class="math">L_Q(1/3, (48/9)^{1/3})</span> . For prime-power n, this improves upon the complexity achieved in [38].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Sarkar and Singh [39]. A new polynomial selection algorithm, called Algorithm- <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}</span> , was described. This provides another translation of Algorithm- <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span>  to the TNFS setting without requiring the condition  <span class="math">\\gcd(\\eta,\\kappa)=1</span> . Special cases of Algorithm- <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}</span>  lead to the GJL and the Conjugation methods in both classical NFS and TNFS. As a result, Algorithm- <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}</span>  subsumes the Jeong-Kim polynomial selection method. The asymptotic complexity for the medium prime case can be described as follows. Let  <span class="math">p=L_Q(a,c_p)</span>  with  <span class="math">1/3\\leq a&lt;2/3</span>  and suppose that  <span class="math">q=p^\\eta</span>  can be written as  <span class="math">q=L_Q(2/3,c_\\theta)</span> . Then the asymptotic complexity is  <span class="math">L_Q(1/3,2c_b)</span>  where  <span class="math">c_b</span>  is given by (5) with  <span class="math">c_p</span>  replaced by  <span class="math">c_\\theta</span> . The minimum complexity is still  <span class="math">L_Q(1/3,(48/9)^{1/3})</span>  which is the same as that of the Jeong-Kim method and this complexity is attained for  <span class="math">c_\\theta=12^{1/3}</span> . However, improvements in asymptotic complexity are obtained for certain ranges of values of  <span class="math">c_\\theta</span> .</p>

      <h3 id="sec-4.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.1 Multiple Number Field Sieve Algorithm</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Multiple number fields can also be used with the TNFS [31]. As in the case of the NFS, this reduces the asymptotic complexity. The best achievable complexity for the medium prime case is  <span class="math">L_Q(1/3, 1.71)</span> .</p>

      <h3 id="sec-4.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.2 Special Number Field Sieve Algorithm</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As explained above, the main advantage of the TNFS method is to transform the problem for the medium characteristic case to that of the boundary characteristic for which the complexity is lower. In fact, it is also possible to transform to the large characteristic case. Carrying out this exercise for the SNFS (yielding the SexTNFS algorithm) leads to an asymptotic complexity of  <span class="math">L_Q(1/3, (32/9)^{1/3})</span>  for the medium prime case; this complexity is achieved for all medium primes unlike the case of TNFS. This works for composite n; in the case where n has a non-trivial factorization as  <span class="math">n = \\eta \\kappa</span>  with  <span class="math">\\gcd(\\eta, \\kappa) = 1</span> , this complexity was reported in [31], whereas the same complexity was reported in [25] without the restriction  <span class="math">\\gcd(\\eta, \\kappa) = 1</span> .</p>

In other words, one takes C(&eta;, 2&kappa;, H) = LQ(2/3, o(1)) and C(&eta;, &kappa;, H) = LQ(2/3, o(1)), and consequently their contribution to the overall running time LQ(1/3, c) is absorbed by the o(1) term in the latter.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The bounds obtained on the norms N(f, &phi;) and N(g, &phi;) are used to estimate the probability that a random sieving polynomial will provide a relation. The required condition is that the principal ideals generated by the images of &phi; in the two integer rings are smooth over the factor base. Two assumptions are used, which means that the entire analysis is heuristic.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

(See Theorem 15.2 of [26] for the statement of the theorem.) The smoothness probability can also be expressed in concrete terms.

      <h3 id="sec-5.5" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5.5 Balancing Costs</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the asymptotic analysis, the costs of the relation collection and the linear algebra phases are balanced. This balancing proceeds by imposing two conditions. Recall that the number of sieving polynomials is E<sup>2</sup> and the size of the factor base is B1+o(1). Sparse linear algebra requires time B2+o(1). Hence, the costs of the relation collection and linear algebra phases are balanced by setting E = B.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that this assumes that the total time for sieving with E<sup>2</sup> polynomials is equal to the time required for completing the linear algebra phase. While this is true in an asymptotic sense, in concrete terms the two costs can be significantly different. We note the following differences between these two tasks.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>For both sieving and linear algebra, the basic operations are field operations in Fp. However, the number of such field operations are different for the two tasks.</li>
    </ol></li>
      <li><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>For linear algebra, it is required to perform read and write operations on a very large matrix. In practice, these read/write operations will incur a significant overhead.</li>
    </ol></li>
      <li><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>The sieving step is parallelizable up to any extent. This is not true for the linear algebra step. The block Wiedemann algorithm can be parallelized, but this comes at the cost of additional memory requirements.</li>
    </ol></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We take some concrete values to get an idea of the effect of the constants in the norm bounds on the smoothness probability. Suppose Q &asymp; 2 3000 , n = 12, &eta; = 4, &kappa; = 3, H = 5, whence p &asymp; 2 250 . Assume that the factor base size is B = 2<sup>64</sup> so that the linear algebra phase requires approximately 2 <sup>128</sup> operations. As discussed in &sect;5.5, E is taken to be equal to B so that E is also 264. Then taking the upper bounds in (7) to be the norm values and the hidden constants in the big-O notation to be 1, we obtain</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\begin{split} N(f,\\phi) &amp;\\approx \\mathfrak{C}(4,6,5) E^{2\\kappa} (\\log p)^{\\eta} \\approx 2^{593}, \\\\ N(g,\\phi) &amp;\\approx \\mathfrak{C}(4,3,5) E^{\\kappa} Q^{1/(2\\kappa)} \\approx 2^{783}, \\\\ \\Pi(N(f,\\phi),B) &amp;\\approx \\Pi(2^{593},2^{64}) \\approx 2^{-29.8}, \\\\ \\Pi(N(g,\\phi),B) &amp;\\approx \\Pi(2^{783},2^{64}) \\approx 2^{-44.2}, \\\\ \\mathfrak{n} &amp;= (\\Pi(N(f,\\phi),B) \\cdot \\Pi(N(g,\\phi),B))^{-1} \\approx 2^{74}. \\end{split}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Hence a single relation will be obtained after trying about 2<sup>74</sup> sieving polynomials. On the other hand, if we ignore the factors C(4, 6, 5) and C(4, 3, 5), then n &asymp; 2 <sup>54</sup>. So, in this case the effect of the constants in the norm bounds is to increase the number of iterations for finding a single relation by a factor of about 2<sup>20</sup> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The number of iterations required to find a single relation affects the overall cost of the algorithm. The total number of iterations required to find the B required relations determines the cost of the relation collection phase. If we take the constants into account, the relation collection phase will have cost about 274B = 2<sup>138</sup> for B = 264. On the other hand, if the constants are ignored, then the relation collection phase will have cost about 254B = 2118. In both cases, the linear algebra phase will have cost approximately B<sup>2</sup> = 2<sup>128</sup> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The above choice of B does not balance the costs of the relation collection and linear algebra phases. We have redone the calculations with Q &asymp; 2 <sup>3000</sup> so as to balance these costs. The overall approximate costs of the algorithm are given by the values in the fourth column (if the constants are taken into consideration) and fifth column (if the constants are ignored) of the first row of Table 2. The size of the factor base is the square root of the overall cost.</p>

These constants are C(&eta;, &kappa;, H) and C(&eta;, 2&kappa;, H) for exTNFS, and C(&eta;, &kappa;, H) and C(&eta;, &kappa;&lambda;, H) for SexTNFS.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A similar calculation can be done for SexTNFS; cf. Remark 2. In this case, however, the minimum complexity is not achieved for &eta; = 4 and &kappa; = 3. Instead the minimum is achieved for &eta; = 6 and &kappa; = 2. Since in this case &eta; and &kappa; are not coprime, this choice would not be allowed by the Kim-Barbulescu work [31], but would be permitted by [25]. The run times considering and ignoring constants are respectively given in the second row of Table 2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We have performed similar calculations for n = 18 and n = 24. It turns out that the factorization of n that minimizes the exTNFS complexity is not the same as the factorization of n that minimizes the SexTNFS complexity.

We observe the following from the values in Table 2.</p>

      <li><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>The concrete run time for exTNFS is smaller than that of SexTNFS. (The only exception to this is for n = 12 and when the constants in the norm bounds are ignored.)

      <li>The asymptotic expression for the run time does not have any dependence on n and depends only on Q. This means that for a given Q, the run times will asymptotically be the same for all n.

This is because the constants in the norm bound depend on n and increase quite rapidly as n increases.</li>

    <p class="text-gray-300">These values should be compared with the norm bounds for exTNFS-Conj given by (7). The values of  <span class="math">\\lambda</span>  are 4, 6, 8 and 10 respectively for BN, BLS12, KSS and BLS24 curves. In the asymptotic complexity analysis,  <span class="math">\\lambda</span>  is treated as a constant and does not have a noticeable influence on the run time. On the other hand, in the concrete analysis, the actual value of  <span class="math">\\lambda</span>  has a noticeable effect on the upper bound on  <span class="math">N(g,\\phi)</span> . This effect is present even if the constants  <span class="math">\\mathfrak{C}(\\eta,\\kappa,H)</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathfrak{C}(\\eta,\\kappa\\lambda,H)</span>  are ignored. Since a higher value of the norm bound implies a lower smoothness probability and hence a higher overall run time, the concrete run time for SexTNFS turns out to be greater than that of exTNFS.</p>

For a fixed Q, as n increases, p decreases. Since the elliptic curve group is of size roughly p, the size of the elliptic curve group also decreases. Considering the 128-bit security level, the size of p going below 256 will violate Pollard-rho security. Hence, 128-bit security cannot be achieved by keeping Q at the 3000-bit level and simply increasing p beyond 12.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">\\mu = \\Pi(U_f, B) \\cdot \\Pi(U_g, B)</span>  and  <span class="math">\\nu = \\Pi(V_f, B) \\cdot \\Pi(V_g, B)</span>  where B is the factor base size. Then  <span class="math">\\mu</span>  is a lower bound on the probability of obtaining a single relation and  <span class="math">\\mu^{-1}</span>  is an upper bound on the number of iterations required to obtain a single relation. The quantity  <span class="math">\\nu</span>  is similar to that of  <span class="math">\\mu</span>  except that  <span class="math">V_f</span>  and  <span class="math">V_g</span>  are used instead of  <span class="math">U_f</span>  and  <span class="math">U_g</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In [9], an example is provided to show that the resultant bounds are tight and in general cannot be improved. On the other hand, the question of whether the bounds are tight for the kinds of polynomials arising in the context of NFS algorithms deserves an answer. To determine this, we conducted some experiments. The generalized Conjugate method (gConj) [25] was implemented and the polynomials h(z), f(x) and g(x) computed. This determines  <span class="math">H = ||h||_{\\infty}</span> ,  <span class="math">||f||_{\\infty}</span>  and  <span class="math">||g||_{\\infty}</span> . Now choose a value for B and set E = B so that the number of sieving polynomials  <span class="math">\\phi(x)</span>  is  <span class="math">B^2</span> . We further set t = 2, i.e., only linear sieving polynomials were considered. Then the coefficients of a sieving polynomial  <span class="math">\\phi(x)</span>  (considered as a bivariate polynomial in z and x) can take  <span class="math">B^{1/\\eta}</span>  values. We chose 1000 random sieving polynomials and in each case computed the actual values of  <span class="math">N(f,\\phi)</span>  and  <span class="math">N(g,\\phi)</span> . From these two values, the smoothness probability  <span class="math">\\pi = \\Pi(N(f,\\phi),B) \\cdot \\Pi(N(g,\\phi),B)</span>  was computed. Let  <span class="math">\\overline{N}_f</span> ,  <span class="math">\\overline{N}_g</span>  and  <span class="math">\\overline{\\pi}</span>  be the average of  <span class="math">N(f,\\phi)</span> ,  <span class="math">N(g,\\phi)</span>  and  <span class="math">\\pi</span>  computed over the 1000 random  <span class="math">\\phi</span> 's. A summary of these values is given in Table 3. The table also shows the results of a similar experiment conducted for the SexTNFS algorithm where BN curves were used.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In each case considered in Table 3, it turned out that taking H=2 is sufficient. We have previously considered H=5 and the reduced value of H=2 results in slightly lower values for  <span class="math">U_f</span>  and  <span class="math">U_g</span> . There are several points to note from the results in Table 3.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-6.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">6.2 Deriving Group Sizes from the Asymptotic Run Time Expressions</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this subsection, we consider the question of deriving concrete group sizes from the asymptotic run time expressions. Following the ECRYPT recommendation [42, Page 26], consider a constant A and write the run time of an NFS algorithm as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$A \\cdot \\exp\\left((c + o(1))(\\log Q)^{1/3}(\\log\\log Q)^{2/3}\\right).</span>$
(11)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Again following [42], assume o(1) = 0. In [42], the constant A is determined in the following manner. It is mentioned that experience from available data points suggests that the resistance of RSA-512 is about 4 to 6 bits lower than that of DES. Plugging in Q = 2<sup>512</sup> and c = (64/9)1/<sup>3</sup> into (11) and setting the resulting expression equal to 250, one obtains A &asymp; 2 &minus;14 .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">More generally, let A = 2&minus;<sup>d</sup> and denote by s(Q, c, d) the base-two logarithm of the expression in (11) with o(1) = 0. Then, we have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$s(Q, c, d) = c(\\lg e)(\\log Q)^{1/3}(\\log \\log Q)^{2/3} - d.</span>$
(12)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Here Q is p <sup>n</sup> and c is the second argument in the L-notation. As described above, the ECRYPT recommendation takes d = 14.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The task of deriving group sizes is the following. Given c, d, n and a target security level <code>, find the minimum Q such that both (lg Q)/n &ge; 2</code> and s(Q, c, d) &ge; <code> hold. The first condition ensures Pollard-rho security while the second condition ensures security against (exT)NFS attack. In the case where &rho; &gt; 1 (see Table 1), the Pollard-rho condition (lg Q)/n &ge; 2</code> should be replaced with the condition (lg Q)/n &ge; 2\`&rho;.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Taking c = (64/9)1/<sup>3</sup> and d = 14, yields lg Q values of 3247, 7958, 15447 for \` = 128, 192, 256, respectively. These values of lg Q are close to the ECRYPT recommendations of 3248, 7936, 15424. We note that taking  <span class="math">c = (64/9)^{1/3}</span>  and d = 10 yields  <span class="math">\\lg Q</span>  values of 3034, 7587, 14889 for  <span class="math">\\ell = 128</span> , 192, 256, respectively. Rounding up these  <span class="math">\\lg Q</span>  values to the nearest integer multiple of 512 yields 3072, 7680, 15360, which are the NIST recommendations for prime-order fields at the 128, 192, 256-bit security levels [6].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 4. (on the choice of d) As we have described earlier, the  <span class="math">L_Q(1/3,c)</span>  run time expression for exTNFS is obtained from the bounds  <span class="math">\\mathfrak{C}(\\eta, 2\\kappa, H) \\cdot E^{2\\kappa} \\cdot O((\\log p)^{\\eta})</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathfrak{C}(\\eta, \\kappa, H) \\cdot E^{\\kappa} \\cdot O(Q^{1/(2\\kappa)})</span>  respectively on the norms  <span class="math">N(f, \\phi)</span>  and  <span class="math">N(g, \\phi)</span> . The asymptotic analysis considers  <span class="math">\\mathfrak{C}(\\eta, 2\\kappa, H)</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathfrak{C}(\\eta, \\kappa, H)</span>  to be  <span class="math">L_Q(2/3, o(1))</span>  and ultimately the effect of these constants get absorbed in the o(1) term in (11). At a later point, when we set o(1) to be 0, we are in effect replacing the constants by 1. The values in Table 3 show that replacing the constants by 1 actually results in underestimates of the run time compared to what would be obtained from the actual values of the norms.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Choosing a positive value of d amounts to considering the actual run time to be lower than the run time predicted by values obtained from the asymptotic expression  <span class="math">L_Q(1/3, c)</span>  (with o(1) assumed to be 0). Since the values obtained from the asymptotic run time expression are already lower than what would be obtained from the actual value of the norms, reducing these values further by choosing a value of d greater than 0 seems to be over-engineering. So, we suggest that the value of d be taken as 0 which would mean choosing A = 1 in (11).</p>

      <h3 id="sec-6.3" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">6.3 The 128-bit and 192-bit Security Levels</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we provide estimates of group sizes required to achieve a desired security level. These estimates depend on the values of the norms  <span class="math">N(f,\\phi)</span>  and  <span class="math">N(g,\\phi)</span> . One can work with the upper bounds on these norms. The upper bounds involve the constant terms which can be quite large. The experiments reported in Section 6.1 show that the actual values of the norms appear to be closer to the expressions for the upper bounds without the constants. So, we report group size estimates both with and without the constants in the norm bounds. The estimates obtained without considering the constants can be considered to be conservative estimates. The actual methodology for obtaining the estimates is described below.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For each choice of security level  <span class="math">\\ell \\in \\{128, 192\\}</span> , the value of n, the choice of curve, the choice of the algorithm (exTNFS or SexTNFS), and the choice of whether or not to use constants in the bounds, the following was done. For each possible non-trivial factor  <span class="math">\\eta</span>  of n, let  <span class="math">lgp(\\eta)</span>  denote the minimum value of lg p required to achieve security level  <span class="math">\\ell</span> . The maximum of  <span class="math">lgp(\\eta)</span>  over all possible non-trivial factors  <span class="math">\\eta</span>  of n is reported.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The values  <span class="math">\\operatorname{lgp}(\\eta)</span>  were determined as follows. The initial value of  <span class="math">\\operatorname{lg} p</span>  was taken to be  <span class="math">2\\rho\\ell</span>  and the size B of the factor base was fixed to  <span class="math">2^{\\ell/2}</span> . The joint smoothness probability (9) was computed and the value of  <span class="math">\\operatorname{lg} p</span>  was incremented until for the first time the joint smoothness probability became lower than  <span class="math">2^{-\\ell/2}</span> . This value was returned as  <span class="math">\\operatorname{lgp}(\\eta)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Once  <span class="math">\\lg p</span>  was calculated, the complexity of each stage was determined as follows. With all other parameters fixed, the value of B was incremented until the smoothness probability became approximately equal to 1/B. This balances the costs of the relation collection and the linear algebra stages.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The final results are given in Tables 4 and 5. Note that all estimates were generated using H=2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A reasonable conclusion is that BN curves with  <span class="math">\\lg p = 383</span>  and  <span class="math">\\lg Q = 4596</span>  offer (at least) 128 bits of security. With these parameters, there is a mismatch in security levels with BN curves</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 5. Approximate run times of exTNFS and SexTNFS for values of Q and n that achieve the 192-bit security level. The constants are C(&eta;, &kappa;, H) and C(&eta;, 2&kappa;, H) for exTNFS, and C(&eta;, &kappa;, H) and C(&eta;, &kappa;&lambda;, H) for SexTNFS.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(&lambda; = 4) for G<sup>1</sup> and G<sup>T</sup> &mdash; the former offers 191 bits of security, whereas the latter offers 128 bits. On the other hand, BLS12 curves (&lambda; = 6) with lg p = 384 and lg Q = 4608 do not have this mismatch &mdash; G<sup>1</sup> and G<sup>T</sup> both offer 128 bits of security (the former since the bitlength of r is approximately 256). Since KSS curves have &rho; &asymp; 4/3 and BLS24 curves have &rho; &asymp; 1.25, these curves with lg p = 342 and lg p = 320, respectively, offer (at least) 128 bits of security. In summary, if one is aiming for the 128-bit security level, then the bitlength of p should be at least 383, 384, 342 and 320 for BN, BLS12, KSS and BLS24 pairings.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the 192-bit security level, the bitlength of p should be at least 1031, 1147, 597 and 480 for BLS, BLS12, KSS and BLS24 pairings. This should be contrasted with the pre-TNFS recommendations of 640, 640, 512 and 480 bits [1].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 5. We have reported group size estimates for several families of curves at the 128-bit and the 192-bit security levels. The methodology for obtaining these estimates is more general. It can be applied to other curve families and also to the 256-bit security level.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 6. Prior to the recent developments of the TNFS algorithm, BN curves with a 256-bit p (and consequently a 3072-bit Q) were considered to provide 128-bit security. Applying our methodology to these curves, we find the runtime estimates of exTNFS are 2<sup>136</sup> and 2<sup>118</sup> with and without constants respectively; and the runtime estimates of SexTNFS are 2<sup>150</sup> and 2<sup>110</sup> with and without constants respectively. Thus, a conservative estimate of the security level of BN curves with a 256-bit prime p is 110 bits.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our examination of the run times of recently-proposed improvements to the TNFS highlights their asymptotic nature. Much work remains to be done before the impact of these new algorithms on concrete keylengths for pairing-based cryptography can be determined with full confidence. Before this concrete analysis is completed, a conservative choice for BN pairings would be to increase the bitlength of p from 256 to 383 if one is aiming for the 128-bit security level. For BLS12, KSS and BLS24 pairings, there is no change in the pre-TNFS recommendations to use primes p of bitlength 384, 342 and 320, respectively, at the 128-bit security level. At the 192-bit security level, conservative choices for the bitlength p are 1031, 1147, 597 and 480 for BN, BLS12, KSS and BL24 pairings, respectively.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">A Calculations of Bounds on Resultants</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Consider the setting of the TNFS with  <span class="math">Q = p^n</span> ,  <span class="math">n = \\eta \\kappa</span> , h a degree- <span class="math">\\eta</span>  irreducible polynomial in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}[z]</span> ,  <span class="math">R = \\mathbb{Z}[z]/(h(z))</span> , and  <span class="math">f, \\phi \\in R[x]</span> . Note that  <span class="math">\\deg_z f = \\deg_z \\phi = \\eta - 1</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">\\mathfrak{f}(z,x)</span>  be a bivariate polynomial with integer coefficients where  <span class="math">\\mathfrak{f}_{i,j}</span>  is the coefficient of  <span class="math">x^iz^j</span> . Then  <span class="math">\\|\\mathfrak{f}\\|_{\\infty} = \\max |\\mathfrak{f}_{i,j}|</span> . Bounds on resultants of univariate and bivariate polynomials have been given in [9]. We summarize these below.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let a(u) and b(u) be two polynomials with integer coefficients. From [9], we have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$|\\operatorname{Res}_{u}(a(u), b(u))| \\le (\\deg(a) + 1)^{\\deg(b)/2} \\cdot (\\deg(b) + 1)^{\\deg(a)/2} \\cdot ||a||_{\\infty}^{\\deg(b)} \\cdot ||b||_{\\infty}^{\\deg(a)}.</span>$
(13)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let a(u, v) and b(u, v) be two polynomials with integer coefficients. Let  <span class="math">c(u) = \\text{Res}_v(a(u, v), b(u, v))</span> . Then</p>

(14)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The bounds given by (13) and (14) combine to provide bounds on  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Res}_z(\\operatorname{Res}_x(\\phi(x),\\mathfrak{f}(x)),h(z))</span> . Let  <span class="math">\\mathfrak{c}(z)=\\operatorname{Res}_x(\\phi(x),\\mathfrak{f}(x))</span> . The degree of  <span class="math">\\mathfrak{c}(z)</span>  is given in [9] and from (14) we obtain  <span class="math">\\|\\mathfrak{c}\\|_{\\infty}</span> . These quantities are as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\begin{split} \\deg \\mathfrak{c}(z) &amp;= (\\deg_x \\phi + \\deg_x f) \\cdot \\max(\\deg_z \\phi + \\deg_z f) = (\\eta - 1)(\\deg_x \\phi + \\deg_x f), \\\\ \\|\\mathfrak{c}\\|_{\\infty} &amp;\\leq (\\deg_x \\phi + \\deg_x \\mathfrak{f})! \\cdot (\\max(\\deg_z \\phi, \\deg_z \\mathfrak{f}) + 1)^{\\deg_x \\phi + \\deg_x \\mathfrak{f} - 1} \\cdot \\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty}^{\\deg_x \\mathfrak{f}} \\cdot \\|\\mathfrak{f}\\|_{\\infty}^{\\deg_x \\phi} \\\\ &amp;= (\\deg_x \\phi + \\deg_x \\mathfrak{f})! \\cdot \\eta^{\\deg_x \\phi + \\deg_x \\mathfrak{f} - 1} \\cdot \\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty}^{\\deg_x \\mathfrak{f}} \\cdot \\|\\mathfrak{f}\\|_{\\infty}^{\\deg_x \\phi}. \\end{split}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using these values we obtain</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$|\\operatorname{Res}_{z}(\\operatorname{Res}_{x}(\\phi(x),\\mathfrak{f}(x)),h(z))| = |\\operatorname{Res}_{z}(\\mathfrak{c}(z),h(z))|</span>$</p>

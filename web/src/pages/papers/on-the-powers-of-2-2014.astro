    <p class="text-gray-300">Abstract. In 2013 the function field sieve algorithm for computing discrete logarithms in finite fields of small characteristic underwent a series of dramatic improvements, culminating in the first heuristic quasi-polynomial time algorithm, due to Barbulescu, Gaudry, Joux and Thomé. In this article we present an alternative descent method which is built entirely from the on-the-fly degree two elimination method of Göloğlu, Granger, McGuire and Zumbrägel. This also results in a heuristic quasi-polynomial time algorithm, for which the descent does not require any relation gathering or linear algebra eliminations and interestingly, does not require any smoothness assumptions about non-uniformly distributed polynomials. These properties make the new descent method readily applicable at currently viable bitlengths and better suited to theoretical analysis.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">¹ Introduction</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The discrete logarithm problem (DLP) in finite fields has been studied for over a century and has been of immense importance to public key cryptography ever since its inception in 1976 [7]. After very little progress in the field for nearly three decades, in 2013 a series of algorithmic breakthroughs occurred which demonstrated that for small to medium characteristic fields, the DLP is far easier than originally believed.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In particular, in February 2013, Göloğlu, Granger, McGuire and Zumbrägel showed that for binary (and more generally small characteristic) fields of a certain form, relation generation for degree one elements runs in heuristic polynomial time, as does finding the logarithms of degree two elements, once degree one logarithms have been computed [8]. Joux then showed that for fields of a similar form the individual logarithm phase can be completed with heuristic complexity <span class="math">L(1/4 + o(1))^{\\dagger}</span>, which was a major improvement over all previous algorithms, which had <span class="math">L(1/3)</span> complexity [13].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Most recently, in June 2013 and for fields of the same form and of bitlength <span class="math">l</span>, Barbulescu, Gaudry, Joux and Thomé announced a quasi-polynomial time algorithm (referred to hereafter as the QPA) for solving the DLP [2] which has heuristic complexity</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">l^{O(\\log l)}. \\tag{1}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since (1) is smaller than <span class="math">L(\\alpha)</span> for any <span class="math">\\alpha &amp;gt; 0</span>, it is asymptotically the most efficient algorithm known for solving the DLP in finite fields of small characteristic.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The degree one relation generation method of [13] runs in heuristic polynomial time and is essentially isomorphic to that in [8]. However, for degree two elimination, the approaches of Joux and Göloğlu et al. differ. While Joux proposed to find the logarithms of all degree two elements via many applications of what may be viewed as the QPA elimination step, the degree two element elimination method in [8] is arguably superior, since it eliminates them on the fly, i.e., almost instantly, thanks to the technique not needing to gather any relations or perform</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">** Supported by the Irish Research Council via grant number ELEVATEPD/2013/82. † As usual, we have <span class="math">L(\\alpha, c) = L_Q(\\alpha, c) = \\exp((c + o(1))(\\log Q)^{\\alpha}(\\log \\log Q)^{1 - \\alpha})</span>, with <span class="math">Q</span> the cardinality of the field. For simplicity, we sometimes suppress the subscript, the constant <span class="math">c</span>, or both.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">any linear algebra eliminations. This difference in techniques partly explains the surprisingly low running times for the example discrete logarithm computations performed in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{6120}}</span> <em>[9]</em> and <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{4404}}</span> <em>[10]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The present paper revisits this on-the-fly degree two elimination method, with a view to extending it to all degrees so that one obtains the same dramatic speed-up relative to the QPA elimination steps. However, due to the nature of our extension of the on-the-fly degree two elimination method, the technique we present here applies only to elements of even degree. For the purpose of building a fully functional DLP algorithm, this is not a problem, since one can use a Dirichlet-type theorem due to Wan <em>[14, Thm. 5.1]</em> to ensure that target elements are initially irreducible and of degree a power of <span class="math">2</span>, and then apply the elimination step recursively to obtain a quasi-polynomial time algorithm.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Interestingly, our new descent does not require any smoothness assumptions about non-uniformly distributed polynomials, in contrast to all previous index calculus algorithms. Furthermore, it is easy to show that such assumptions can also be removed from the degree one relation generation, thus simplifying the set of assumptions that are needed for heuristic complexity analyses. Note that while smoothness assumptions can be tested and verified for example parameters, it is entirely feasible that for certain ‘corner cases’, i.e., for specific field representations and elements to be eliminated, they are simply wrong. To take an example, the polynomials considered in <em>[8]</em> have an exponentially larger probability of splitting than do uniformly chosen polynomials of the same degree, and there may well be theoretical obstructions preventing other polynomials from being sufficiently smooth during an elimination step of the QPA. Hence the removal of smoothness assumptions builds confidence in our ability to compute discrete logarithms in small characteristic fields in quasi-polynomial time.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With the above being said, our elimination method does however make use of a heuristic which was implicitly already used in <em>[8, 9]</em>, relating to the number of points on a special family of curves. The form of this heuristic is such that it is readily amenable to analysis; indeed, we prove it in sufficient generality for our purposes. Our algorithm therefore relies on only two heuristics; the first relates to the existence of irreducible polynomials of a given form, while the second is that the aforementioned polynomial time algorithm for computing factor base logarithms works.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 contains a brief overview of the function field sieve (FFS) including most of its recent improvements, from a unifying perspective. However, the on-the-fly degree two elimination method is reserved for Section 3, which contains the new algorithm. The underlying heuristics and applicability of the algorithm are discussed in Section 4, with the elimination of the aforementioned heuristic deferred until the appendix. We conclude in Section 5.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-2" class="text-2xl font-bold">2 Overview of the Function Field Sieve</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we briefly review the classical FFS and describe some of the new techniques. The knowledgeable reader may omit this section, having familiarised themself with the notation via a brief look at Fig. 1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">p</span> be a prime and let <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{l}}</span> be the underlying finite field of the DLP to be solved. Let <span class="math">q</span> be a power of <span class="math">p</span>, let <span class="math">k\\geq 1</span>, and let <span class="math">n\\geq 1</span> such that the DLP can be embedded into <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{kn}}</span>, i.e., <span class="math">p^{l}\\mid q^{kn}</span>. A relation in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{kn}}</span> is an equality of products of elements in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{kn}}^{\\times}</span>, or, equivalently, a linear combination of logarithms of elements in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{kn}}^{\\times}</span> whose sum is zero. All variants of the FFS rely on the following basic method for obtaining relations. Let <span class="math">R=\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}[X,Y]</span> and let <span class="math">f_{1},f_{2}\\in R</span> be two irreducible polynomials such that <span class="math">R_{12}=R/(f_{1},f_{2})</span> is a finite ring surjecting onto the target field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{kn}}</span>. Furthermore, for <span class="math">i=1,2</span>, let <span class="math">R_{i}=\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}[X,Y]/(f_{i})</span> and <span class="math">Z_{i}\\in R</span> such that the quotient field <span class="math">\\mathrm{Quot}(R_{i})</span> is a finite extension of the rational function field <span class="math">\\mathrm{Quot}(Q_{i})</span> where <span class="math">Q_{i}=\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}[Z_{i}]</span>. This is summarised in Figure 1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Fig. 1: Setup for the FFS !<a href="img-0.jpeg">img-0.jpeg</a></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Via the <span class="math">\\pi</span>, <span class="math">\\varphi_{1}</span> and <span class="math">\\varphi_{2}</span> logarithms in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{kn}}^{\\times}</span> can be extended to a notion of logarithms in <span class="math">R_{i} \\setminus (\\pi \\circ \\varphi_{i})^{-1}(0)</span>, <span class="math">i = 1,2</span>. Therefore, relations can also be viewed as linear combinations of logarithms of elements in <span class="math">R_{1}</span> and in <span class="math">R_{2}</span> whose sum is zero. It is always implicitly assumed that all logarithms are defined, i.e., that the sets <span class="math">(\\pi \\circ \\varphi_{i})^{-1}(0)</span>, <span class="math">i = 1,2</span>, are avoided.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A polynomial <span class="math">P \\in R</span> gives rise to a relation by decomposing <span class="math">P \\bmod f_i</span> in <span class="math">R_i</span> for <span class="math">i = 1</span> and <span class="math">i = 2</span> (and mapping down to <span class="math">R_{12}</span> or <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{kn}}</span> if desired). Sufficiently many non-trivial relations amongst elements of a set of bounded size allow one to compute logarithms in this set. If the multiplicative closure of such a set is <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{kn}}^{\\times}</span>, arbitrary logarithms can be computed by expressing an element as a product of elements of this set. This is done by following a descent strategy in which elements, called special-<span class="math">Q</span>, are recursively rewritten as 'easier' elements using relations as above.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the classical FFS the polynomials <span class="math">f_{1}, f_{2}</span> are chosen such that their degrees are as low as possible, typically of the form <span class="math">f_{1} = Y - a(X)</span>, <span class="math">f_{2} = \\sum_{j=0}^{d} b_{j}(X)Y^{j}</span> with <span class="math">\\deg_{X}(a) = e</span>, <span class="math">\\deg_{X}(b_{j}) &amp;lt; e</span> and <span class="math">de &amp;gt; n</span>, and <span class="math">Z_{1} = Z_{2} = X</span> so that the extensions <span class="math">\\mathrm{Quot}(R_{i}) / \\mathrm{Quot}(Q_{i})</span>, <span class="math">i = 1, 2</span>, are of degree 1 and degree <span class="math">d</span>, respectively. By choosing <span class="math">P</span> as a low-degree polynomial, the degrees of the norms <span class="math">N_{\\mathrm{Quot}(R_{i}) / \\mathrm{Quot}(Q_{i})}(P \\bmod f_{i})</span>, <span class="math">i = 1, 2</span>, are not too big and therefore the chance of both norms splitting into low-degree polynomials is sufficiently high. With judiciously selected parameters this gives a heuristic running time of <span class="math">L(1/3)</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The main difference between the classical FFS and the recent variations [8, 12, 2] is where the relation generation begins. In the recent variations a product of low-degree polynomials <span class="math">\\tilde{P} = \\prod \\tilde{P}_j</span> in <span class="math">R_1</span> is constructed in such a way that it can be lifted to a low-degree polynomial <span class="math">P \\in R</span> and such that its reduction <span class="math">P \\bmod f_2</span> is of sufficiently low degree, where by low degree we mean that the norm has low degree. This can be achieved by choosing <span class="math">q</span> in the order of <span class="math">n</span>, <span class="math">f_1 = Y - X^q</span> and <span class="math">f_2</span> of low degree. Then <span class="math">R_1 = \\mathbb{F}_{q^k}[X]</span> and low-degree polynomials <span class="math">F, G \\in R_1</span> give rise to relations via</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\tilde {P} = F ^ {q} G - F G ^ {q} = G \\prod_ {\\alpha \\in \\mathbb {F} _ {q}} (F - \\alpha G) = \\prod \\tilde {P} _ {j} \\tag {2}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">since <span class="math">F^q</span> (resp. <span class="math">G^q</span>) can be expressed as a degree <span class="math">\\deg F</span> (resp. <span class="math">\\deg G</span>) polynomial in <span class="math">Y</span>, and thus <span class="math">\\tilde{P}</span> can be lifted to a low-degree polynomial <span class="math">P</span> (another way to obtain relations will be described below). This yields a heuristic polynomial time algorithm for finding relations between elements of <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{kn}}</span> that are, via <span class="math">\\varphi_1</span> and <span class="math">\\pi</span>, images of polynomials of bounded degree.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the descent phase it is advantageous to choose <span class="math">f_{2}</span> such that its degree in <span class="math">X</span> or in <span class="math">Y</span> is one (cf. [10] and [12] respectively), which implies that <span class="math">\\mathrm{Quot}(R_2) = \\mathrm{Quot}(Q_2)</span> with <span class="math">Z_{2} = Y</span> or <span class="math">Z_{2} = X</span>, respectively. More precisely, writing <span class="math">f_{2} = h_{1}X - h_{0}</span> or <span class="math">f_{2} = h_{1}Y - h_{0}</span> respectively,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">h_{i}\\in Q_{2}</span>, <span class="math">i=0,1</span>, implies <span class="math">R_{2}=\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}[Z_{2}][\\frac{1}{h_{1}}]</span>. Up to the logarithm of <span class="math">h_{1}</span>, the logarithm of a polynomial of <span class="math">R_{1}</span> can be related to the logarithm of a corresponding polynomial in <span class="math">R_{2}</span> (the same polynomial for <span class="math">Z_{2}=X</span> and a Frobenius twist for <span class="math">Z_{2}=Y</span>) which allows one to view a special-<span class="math">Q</span> (the element to be eliminated) as coming from <span class="math">R_{1}</span> or from <span class="math">R_{2}</span>. In the latter case, the condition that a polynomial <span class="math">Q\\in R_{2}</span>, a lift of the special-<span class="math">Q</span> element, divides <span class="math">P\\bmod f_{2}</span> for a <span class="math">P</span> arising via (2), can be expressed as a bilinear quadratic system which gives, for appropriate parameter choices, an algorithm with heuristic running time <span class="math">L(1/4+o(1))</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the other case, namely the special-<span class="math">Q</span> element being lifted to <span class="math">Q\\in R_{1}</span>, a certain set of polynomials in <span class="math">R_{1}</span> containing <span class="math">Q</span> is chosen in such a way that pairs <span class="math">F,G</span> from this set generate via (2) sufficiently many relations with <span class="math">P\\bmod f_{2}</span> splitting into polynomials of sufficiently low degree. Solving a linear system of equations then expresses the logarithm of the special-<span class="math">Q</span> element as a linear combination of logarithms of polynomials in <span class="math">R_{2}</span> of sufficiently low degree (and <span class="math">h_{1}</span>), resulting in the heuristic QPA.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Actually, the relations in the QPA (and in <em>[12]</em>) are generated in a slightly different manner by applying linear fractional transformations to the polynomial <span class="math">A=X^{q}-X=\\prod_{\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{F}_{q}}(X-\\alpha)</span>. The subgroup <span class="math">\\mathrm{PGl}_{2}(\\mathbb{F}_{q})\\subset\\mathrm{PGl}_{2}(\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}})</span> is the largest subgroup fixing this polynomial, so that the action of <span class="math">\\mathrm{PGl}_{2}(\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}})/\\mathrm{PGl}_{2}(\\mathbb{F}_{q})</span> on <span class="math">A</span> produces <span class="math">\\frac{q^{3k}-q^{k}}{q^{3}-q}</span> polynomials, each splitting into linear polynomials and whose only non-zero terms correspond to the monomials <span class="math">X^{q+1}</span>, <span class="math">X^{q}</span>, <span class="math">X</span> and <span class="math">1</span>.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-3" class="text-2xl font-bold">3 The New QPA</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we describe a new QPA that relies on three heuristics, which are summarised at the very end of this section and discussed in the next. To make use of all the tools described in the previous section it is necessary to find suitable parameters <span class="math">q</span>, <span class="math">k</span>, <span class="math">n</span> and <span class="math">f_{2}</span> satisfying some conditions. Here the following choice is made. For simplicity let <span class="math">k=4</span>, although the following works with the necessary modifications for <span class="math">k\\in\\{1,2,3\\}</span> as well, and with no modifications for <span class="math">k&gt;4</span>. Let <span class="math">q</span> be the smallest power of <span class="math">p</span> larger than <span class="math">l</span>, and <span class="math">n=l</span> and <span class="math">f_{2}=h_{1}X-h_{0}</span> with <span class="math">h_{i}\\in\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}[Y]</span> of degree at most two for <span class="math">i=0,1</span>, which we do for several reasons, cf. Section 4.1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Heuristically there exist polynomials <span class="math">h_{0},h_{1}</span> as above such that <span class="math">h_{1}(X^{q})X-h_{0}(X^{q})</span> has an irreducible factor of degree <span class="math">n</span>, i.e., such that <span class="math">R_{12}=\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}[X,Y]/(f_{1},f_{2})</span> surjects onto <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{kn}}</span>. This implies <span class="math">R_{1}=\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}[X]</span> and <span class="math">R_{2}=\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}[Y][\\frac{1}{h_{1}}]</span>. Since the logarithm of <span class="math">h_{1}</span> will appear in almost every relation and <span class="math">h_{1}</span> is of degree at most two, it is assumed that this logarithm is known, e.g., by the polynomial time algorithm, and for the sake of simplicity it will be suppressed in the following description. The existence of these parameters is the first heuristic assumption. A similar choice is <span class="math">f_{2}=\\tilde{h}_{1}Y-\\tilde{h}_{0}</span> with <span class="math">\\tilde{h}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}[X]</span> for which the following considerations can be translated easily.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-4" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.1 Review of on-the-fly degree two elimination</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this subsection we recall the on-the-fly degree two elimination method from <em>[8]</em> and the minor modification from <em>[9]</em>, but adjusted for the present framework. Throughout we assume <span class="math">k\\geq 4</span>. In <em>[3]</em> the affine portion of the set of polynomials obtained as linear fractional transformations of <span class="math">X^{q}-X</span> is parameterised as follows. Let <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}</span> be the set of <span class="math">B\\in\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}</span> such that the polynomial <span class="math">X^{q+1}-BX+B</span> splits completely over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}</span>. The cardinality of this set is approximately <span class="math">q^{k-3}</span> <em>[3, Lemma 4.4]</em>. Scaling and translating these polynomials means that all the polynomials <span class="math">X^{q+1}+aX^{q}+bX+c</span> with <span class="math">c\\neq ab</span>, <span class="math">b\\neq a^{q}</span> and <span class="math">B=\\frac{(b-a^{q})^{q+1}}{(c-ab)^{q}}</span> split completely over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}</span> whenever <span class="math">B\\in\\mathcal{B}</span>. Using an elementary extension of <em>[11, Theorem 5]</em> the set <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}</span> can be characterised as the image</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">of <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}\\setminus\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2}}</span> under the map</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">u\\mapsto\\frac{(u-u^{q^{2}})^{q+1}}{(u-u^{q})^{q^{2}+1}}.</span> (3)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">Q</span> (viewed as polynomial in <span class="math">R_{2}</span>) be a quadratic polynomial to be eliminated and let <span class="math">L_{Q}\\subset\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}[Y]^{2}</span> be the lattice defined by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">L_{Q}=\\{(w_{0},w_{1})\\in\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}[Y]^{2}\\mid w_{0}h_{0}+w_{1}h_{1}\\equiv 0\\pmod{Q}\\}.</span> (4)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If <span class="math">Q</span> divides <span class="math">w_{0}h_{0}+w_{1}h_{1}\\neq 0</span> for <span class="math">w_{0},w_{1}\\in\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}</span>, then <span class="math">Q=w(w_{0}h_{0}+w_{1}h_{1})</span> for <span class="math">w\\in\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}^{\\times}</span> since the degree on the right hand side is at most two. In this case the relation generated from <span class="math">P=w_{0}X+w_{1}\\in R</span> relates the logarithm of <span class="math">Q</span> with the logarithm of <span class="math">w_{0}X+w_{1}\\in R_{1}</span> (and the logarithm of <span class="math">h_{1}</span>).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the other case <span class="math">L_{Q}</span> has a basis of the form <span class="math">(u_{0},Y+u_{1}),(Y+v_{0},v_{1})</span> with <span class="math">u_{i},v_{i}\\in\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}</span>. Since the polynomial <span class="math">P=XY+aY+bX+c</span> maps to <span class="math">\\frac{1}{h_{1}}((Y+b)h_{0}+(aY+c)h_{1})</span> in <span class="math">R_{2}</span>, <span class="math">Q</span> divides <span class="math">P</span> mod <span class="math">f_{2}</span> if and only if <span class="math">(Y+b,aY+c)\\in L_{Q}</span>. Note that the numerator of <span class="math">P</span> mod <span class="math">f_{2}</span> is of degree at most three, thus it can at worst contain a linear factor besides <span class="math">Q</span>. If the triple <span class="math">(a,b,c)</span> also satisfies <span class="math">c\\neq ab</span>, <span class="math">b\\neq a^{q}</span> and <span class="math">\\frac{(b-a^{q})^{q+1}}{(c-ab)^{q}}\\in\\mathcal{B}</span>, then <span class="math">P\\bmod f_{1}</span> splits into linear factors and the logarithm of <span class="math">Q</span> has been rewritten in terms of logarithms of linear polynomials.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Algorithmically, a triple <span class="math">(a,b,c)</span> satisfying all conditions can be found in several ways. Choosing a <span class="math">B\\in\\mathcal{B}</span>, considering <span class="math">(Y+b,aY+c)=a(u_{0},Y+u_{1})+(Y+v_{0},v_{1})</span> and rewriting <span class="math">b</span> and <span class="math">c</span> gives the condition</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">B=\\frac{(-a^{q}+u_{0}a+v_{0})^{q+1}}{(-u_{0}a^{2}+(-v_{0}+u_{1})a+v_{1})^{q}}.</span> (5)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">By expressing <span class="math">a</span> in an <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}/\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span> basis, this results in a quadratic system in <span class="math">k</span> variables <em>[9]</em>. Using a Gröbner basis algorithm the running time is exponential in <span class="math">k</span>. Alternatively, and this is the key observation for the present work, equation (5) can be considered as a polynomial of degree <span class="math">q^{2}+q</span> in <span class="math">a</span> whose roots can be found in polynomial time in <span class="math">q</span> and in <span class="math">k</span> <em>[8]</em>. One can also check for random <span class="math">(a,b,c)</span> such that the lattice condition holds, whether <span class="math">X^{q+1}+aX^{q}+bX+c</span> splits into linear polynomials, which happens with probability <span class="math">q^{-3}</span>. This is also polynomial time in <span class="math">q</span> and in <span class="math">k</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">These degree 2 elimination methods will fail when <span class="math">Q</span> divides <span class="math">h_{1}^{q}Y-h_{0}^{q}</span>, because this would imply that the polynomial <span class="math">X^{q+1}+aX^{q}+bX+c</span> is divisible by <span class="math">Q^{(1/q)}(X)</span>, where the coefficients of <span class="math">Q^{(1/q)}</span> are those of <span class="math">Q</span> powered by <span class="math">1/q</span>, a problem first discussed in <em>[5]</em>.

    <h3 id="sec-5" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.2 The basic building block – degree <span class="math">2d</span> elimination</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The on-the-fly degree two elimination method can be transformed into an elimination method for irreducible even degree polynomials. Let <span class="math">\\mathcal{T}</span> be the set of trap roots, i.e., the set of roots of <span class="math">h_{1}Y^{q^{kd-1}}-h_{0}</span> for all <span class="math">d&gt;0</span> and of <span class="math">h_{1}^{q}Y-h_{0}^{q}</span> minus the set of roots of the irreducible field-defining polynomial of degree <span class="math">n</span>. A polynomial in <span class="math">R_{2}</span> is said to be bad if it has a root in <span class="math">\\mathcal{T}</span>; a polynomial in <span class="math">R_{1}</span> is said to be bad if it is bad when viewed as polynomial in <span class="math">R_{2}</span> or, equivalently, if it has a root <span class="math">r</span> with <span class="math">r^{q}\\in\\mathcal{T}</span>. The same definitions are used when the base field of <span class="math">R_{1}</span> and <span class="math">R_{2}</span> is extended. A polynomial which is not bad is said to be good. We now state and prove the following.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Claim 1: Let <span class="math">Q\\in R_{2}</span> be an irreducible good polynomial of degree <span class="math">2d</span> with <span class="math">d\\geq 1</span>. Then the logarithm of <span class="math">Q</span> can be rewritten as a linear combination of at most <span class="math">q+2</span> logarithms of irreducible polynomials of degrees dividing <span class="math">d</span>, in a running time polynomial in <span class="math">q</span> and in <span class="math">d</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Over the extension <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{kd}}</span> the polynomial <span class="math">Q</span> splits into <span class="math">d</span> (irreducible) quadratic polynomials; let <span class="math">Q^{\\prime}</span> be one of them. Applying the on-the-fly degree two elimination method over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{kd}}</span> instead of <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}</span> gives a polynomial <span class="math">P^{\\prime}\\in\\mathbb{F}_{q^{kd}}[X,Y]</span> such that <span class="math">P^{\\prime}\\bmod f_{1}</span> splits into a product of at most <span class="math">q+1</span> polynomials of degree one over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{kd}}</span> and such that <span class="math">(P^{\\prime}\\bmod f_{2})h_{1}</span> is a product of <span class="math">Q^{\\prime}</span> and a polynomial of degree at most one. Let <span class="math">P</span> be the product of all conjugates of <span class="math">P^{\\prime}</span> under <span class="math">\\mathrm{Gal}(\\mathbb{F}_{q^{kd}}/\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}})</span>. Since the product of all conjugates of a linear polynomial under <span class="math">\\mathrm{Gal}(\\mathbb{F}_{q^{kd}}/\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}})</span> is the <span class="math">d_{1}</span>-th power of an irreducible degree <span class="math">d_{2}</span> polynomial for <span class="math">d_{1}</span> and <span class="math">d_{2}</span> satisfying <span class="math">d_{1}d_{2}=d</span>, the rewriting assertion of the claim follows.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The three steps of this method – computing <span class="math">Q^{\\prime}</span>, the on-the-fly degree two elimination (when the second or third approach listed above for solving (5) is used), and the computation of the polynomial norms – all have running time polynomial in <span class="math">q</span> and in <span class="math">d</span>, which proves the running time assertion of the claim.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that the irreducible polynomials of degree dividing <span class="math">d</span> might be bad. This can be avoided by finding sufficiently many different eliminations of <span class="math">Q^{\\prime}</span> and will be further discussed in the appendix.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-6" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.3 Assembling the algorithm</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Recursively applying the basic building block it is possible to express the logarithm of an good irreducible polynomial of degree <span class="math">2^{e}</span>, <span class="math">e\\geq 1</span>, in terms of at most <span class="math">(q+2)^{e}</span> logarithms of linear polynomials. The final step of this recursion, namely expressing up to <span class="math">(q+2)^{e-1}</span> logarithms of polynomials of degree <span class="math">2</span>, dominates the running time which is thus upper bounded by <span class="math">(q+2)^{e}</span> times a polynomial in <span class="math">q</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, note that the logarithms of linear polynomials can be obtained by the polynomial time algorithm (cf. Heuristic 3), and that an element in <span class="math">R_{12}</span> can be lifted to an irreducible good polynomial of degree <span class="math">2^{e}</span> for <span class="math">2^{e}&gt;4n</span>. In fact, with this choice the probability of irreducibility for a random lift is lower bounded by <span class="math">2^{-e-1}</span> which follows from the effective Dirichlet-type theorem on irreducibles in arithmetic progressions <em>[14, Thm. 5.1]</em>, while the goodness follows from a bound on the number of trap roots, see A.1. Summarising, the new QPA proceeds as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The New QPA</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">INPUT: <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{l}}</span>, <span class="math">g\\in\\mathbb{F}_{p^{l}}^{\\times}</span> and <span class="math">h\\in\\langle g\\rangle</span></p>

Find <span class="math">h_{0},h_{1}\\in R</span> such that <span class="math">h_{1}(X^{q})X-h_{0}(X^{q})</span> has an irreducible factor of degree <span class="math">n</span>. Denote by <span class="math">t</span> a lift to <span class="math">R_{12}</span> of the target element in the DLP (for computing <span class="math">\\log_{g}h</span> in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{l}}</span> the algorithm is applied twice, for a lift of <span class="math">g</span> and for a lift of <span class="math">h</span>).</li>

      <li>Choose <span class="math">e</span> such that <span class="math">2^{e}&gt;4n</span> and search for an irreducible polynomial <span class="math">T\\in R_{1}</span> of degree <span class="math">2^{e}</span> with <span class="math">\\varphi_{1}(T)=t</span>.</li>

      <li>Using the basic building block recursively, rewrite the logarithm of <span class="math">T</span> as a linear combination of logarithms of linear polynomials.</li>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that during an elimination step, one need not use the basic building block as stated, which takes the norms of the linear polynomials produced back down to <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}</span>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">We now formally list the heuristics used.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Heuristic 1. Given a prime  <span class="math">p</span>  and an integer  <span class="math">l</span> , for  <span class="math">q</span>  the smallest power of  <span class="math">p</span>  which is greater than  <span class="math">l</span> , and for an integer  <span class="math">k = O(1)</span> , there exist polynomials  <span class="math">h_0, h_1 \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q^k}[X]</span>  of degree at most two such that  <span class="math">h_1(X^q)X - h_0(X^q)</span>  has an irreducible factor of degree  <span class="math">l</span>  (or the equivalent for  <span class="math">h_1(X)X^q - h_0(X)</span> ).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Heuristic 2. With the parameters as in Heuristic 1 the following holds. Let  <span class="math">d \\geq 1</span>  be an integer such that  <span class="math">kd \\geq 4</span> , let  <span class="math">Q \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q^{kd}}[X]</span>  be an irreducible quadratic good polynomial such that  <span class="math">Q</span>  does not divide  <span class="math">w_0h_0 + w_1h_1 \\neq 0</span>  for  <span class="math">w_0, w_1 \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q^{kd}}</span> , and let  <span class="math">(u_0, Y + u_1), (Y + v_0, v_1)</span>  be a basis of the lattice  <span class="math">L_Q</span>  in (4). Then the number of solutions  <span class="math">(a, B) \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q^{kd}} \\times \\mathcal{B}</span>  of (5) resulting in good descendants is lower bounded by the maximum of  <span class="math">q^{kd-3}</span>  divided by a polynomial in  <span class="math">q</span>  of bounded degree, and 1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Heuristic 3. There exists a polynomial time algorithm for obtaining the logarithms of polynomials of bounded degree using the parameters from Heuristic 1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Putting these together we have the following theorem.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Theorem 1. Subject to Heuristics 1,2 and 3, the running time of the new QPA is quasi-polynomial, namely</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">q ^ {\\log_ {2} q + O (1)}.</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that when  <span class="math">q = L_{q^k}(\\alpha)</span>  with  <span class="math">0 &amp;lt; \\alpha \\leq 1/3</span> , one obtains precisely the same complexities as presented in [2]. Also note that subject to a heuristic regarding the smoothness properties of non-uniformly distributed polynomials, the QPA of Barbulescu et al. achieves a slightly better asymptotic complexity, namely  <span class="math">q^{O(\\log q / \\log \\log q)}</span> , as a result of a slightly more rapid descent.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We now state a slight relaxation of Heuristic 2 which is proven in the appendix.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Theorem 2. With the parameters as in Heuristic 1 the following holds for  <span class="math">q &amp;gt; 61</span>  and not a power of 4. Let  <span class="math">d</span>  be an integer such that  <span class="math">kd \\geq 18</span> , let  <span class="math">Q \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q^{kd}}[X]</span>  be an irreducible quadratic good polynomial such that  <span class="math">Q</span>  does not divide  <span class="math">w_0h_0 + w_1h_1 \\neq 0</span>  for  <span class="math">w_0, w_1 \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q^{kd}}</span> , and let  <span class="math">(u_0, Y + u_1), (Y + v_0, v_1)</span>  be a basis of the lattice  <span class="math">L_Q</span>  in (4). Then the number of solutions  <span class="math">(a, B) \\in \\mathbb{F}_{q^{kd}} \\times \\mathcal{B}</span>  of (5) resulting in good descendants is lower bounded by  <span class="math">q^{kd - 8}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In order to satisfy these conditions on  <span class="math">q</span>  one can use the following minutely-changed variant of Heuristic 1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Heuristic 1’. Given a prime <span class="math">p</span> and an integer <span class="math">l</span>, for <span class="math">q</span> the smallest power of <span class="math">p</span> which is greater than <span class="math">\\max(l,61)</span> and not a power of <span class="math">4</span>, and for an integer <span class="math">k=O(1)</span>, there exist polynomials <span class="math">h_{0},h_{1}\\in\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}[X]</span> of degree at most two such that <span class="math">h_{1}(X^{q})X-h_{0}(X^{q})</span> has an irreducible factor of degree <span class="math">l</span> (or the equivalent for <span class="math">h_{1}(X)X^{q}-h_{0}(X)</span>).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Thanks to Theorem 2, the running time in Theorem 1 holds subject to Heuristics 1’ and 3 (or 1 and 3 if <span class="math">q&gt;61</span> and not a power of 4). Furthermore, if one balances the costs of the descent and the computation of the low-degree polynomials, or observes that the number of leaves eventually exceeds the number of irreducibles of that degree, then the running time in Theorem 1 can be replaced with</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">q^{\\log_{2}q-(1-\\epsilon)\\log_{2}\\log_{2}q}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">for any <span class="math">\\epsilon&gt;0</span> and <span class="math">q</span> sufficiently large.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-7" class="text-2xl font-bold">4 Discussion</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We now discuss the remaining heuristics and reflect upon the possible practical impact of the new descent.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-8" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.1 Heuristics</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">First observe that the descent does not require any smoothness assumptions about non-uniformly distributed polynomials. Moreover, we can even avoid its implicit invocation in Heuristic 3 by performing the on-the-fly degree two elimination for many reducible degree two elements, thus producing relations containing only degree one elements.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Two of the heuristics, namely the first and the third, underlie to a greater or lesser extent all other recent finite field discrete logarithm algorithms. Therefore most of the comments in previous papers apply here as well and are not repeated.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One difference of Heuristic 1 to the corresponding heuristic in other methods is that here it is essential for a theoretical analysis that the degrees of <span class="math">h_{0}</span> and <span class="math">h_{1}</span> are at most two. Indeed, if the degree of one of the polynomials were at least four, the degree 2 elimination method might fail in the case that <span class="math">Q</span> divides <span class="math">w_{0}h_{0}+w_{1}h_{1}</span> for some <span class="math">w_{0},w_{1}\\in\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}</span>. In particular, if <span class="math">w_{0}h_{0}+w_{1}h_{1}</span> is of degree 4 and splits into <span class="math">Q\\cdot Q^{\\prime}</span> with another irreducible quadratic polynomial <span class="math">Q^{\\prime}</span>, the method would eliminate <span class="math">Q</span> into <span class="math">Q^{\\prime}</span> and <span class="math">Q^{\\prime}</span> into <span class="math">Q</span>. In the case that the maximum of the degrees of <span class="math">h_{0}</span> and <span class="math">h_{1}</span> is three, the degree 2 elimination method works in the special case but becomes harder to analyse in the general case since the numerator of <span class="math">P\\mod f_{2}</span> is in general of degree 4 and must split into <span class="math">Q</span> and a product of linear polynomials.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-9" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.2 Practical considerations</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In practice, it is not advisable to apply the algorithm as stated. On the contrary, it is advantageous to pick only the best parts and combine them with the best parts of other algorithms. The main ingredient of this algorithm is the fast reduction of irreducible even degree polynomials into polynomials of half the degree and the ensuing preference for degrees that are divisible by powers of two.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Assuming the current state of the art without this algorithm, the best strategy for the descent seems to be the following. At the beginning a continued fraction split and degree-balanced classical descent are used. Depending on the size of the problem the steps from QPA are used, followed by Gröbner basis descent until the degrees are small enough to be tabulated by the polynomial time algorithm. The new algorithm can change this strategy at three points. Firstly, and especially if no QPA steps are used, the classical descent must take into account that the subsequent cost for even degree polynomials will drop (and drop more for degrees divisible by 4 etc.). Secondly, in the QPA stage some splittings of even degree polynomials will be more</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">efficient using the new QPA steps; the exact extent is unclear in practice because of the limited experience with QPA so far. The cross-over from QPA to new QPA elimination steps will entail a polynomial to be eliminated being rewritten as a product of irreducible polynomials whose degrees are of the form <span class="math">d\\cdot 2^{i}</span> with odd <span class="math">d</span> which are eliminable by Gröbner basis descent. Thirdly, in the Gröbner basis stage many descent steps for even degree can be replaced by the new QPA steps; this has already been verified with our Magma experiments at currently viable bitlengths. Of course, determining cross-over points between the various descent strategies for a given field requires extensive experimentation and optimisation, and is beyond the scope of the present article.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-10" class="text-2xl font-bold">5 Conclusion</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We have presented a new quasi-polynomial time descent method for small characteristic discrete logarithms built from a very simple building block, namely on-the-fly degree two element elimination. This eliminates one of the commonly-used heuristics in DLP algorithms, namely the smoothness assumptions regarding non-uniformly distributed polynomials, which therefore makes a heuristic-free quasi-polynomial algorithm a realistic possibility and a worthwhile goal for future research.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">######</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Firstly observe that the first statement of Proposition 2 ensures that one may find an initial irreducible polynomial of degree <span class="math">2^{e}</span> which is good, since the number of traps (<span class="math">&lt;q^{2^{e-1}}</span>) is much smaller than the number (<span class="math">&gt;q^{2^{e}-n}2^{-e-1}</span>) of irreducibles produced by the Dirichlet-type theorem <em>[14, Thm. 5.1]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the case that <span class="math">q&gt;61</span> is not a power of 4 Theorem 2 follows from the theorem and the propositions as follows. By Proposition 1 an irreducible quadratic good polynomial <span class="math">Q</span> satisfies the three conditions of Theorem 3. Since the map (3) is <span class="math">q^{3}-q:1</span> on <span class="math">K\\setminus\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2}}</span>, there are at least <span class="math">q^{kd-4}</span> solutions <span class="math">(a,B)</span> of (5). These solutions contain at least <span class="math">q^{kd-7}</span> different values <span class="math">a</span> since <span class="math">\\deg_{A}(P)=q^{2}+q&lt;q^{3}</span>. By Proposition 2 the set of traps of level dividing <span class="math">\\frac{kd}{2}</span> and of traps of level <span class="math">0</span> has cardinality at most <span class="math">2q^{\\frac{kd}{2}}</span>. By the second assertion of this proposition a trap root can appear in <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\bmod f_{j}</span> for at most two values <span class="math">a</span>, at most once for <span class="math">j=1</span> and at most once for <span class="math">j=2</span>. Hence there are at most <span class="math">4q^{\\frac{kd}{2}}&lt;q^{kd-8}</span> values <span class="math">a</span> for which a trap root appears in <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\bmod f_{j}</span>, <span class="math">j=1,2</span>. Thus there are at least <span class="math">q^{kd-8}</span> different values <span class="math">a</span> for which a solution <span class="math">(a,B)</span> leads to an elimination into logarithms of good polynomials. This reduces the proof of Theorem 2 for <span class="math">q&gt;61</span>, not a power of 4, to proving Theorem 3 and the two propositions above.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark: In the proof only a weaker form of condition <span class="math">(*)</span> is needed, so that the theorem can also be applied to reducible quadratic polynomials <span class="math">Q</span> satisfying some conditions. If needed, this can be carved out of the proof.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-16" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">A.2 Outline of the proof method</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The main step of the proof of the theorem consists in showing that, subject to conditions <span class="math">(<em>)</span>, <span class="math">(<strong>)</span>, and <span class="math">(</strong></em>)</span>, there exists an absolutely irreducible factor <span class="math">P_{1}</span> of <span class="math">P</span> that lies already in <span class="math">K[A,U]</span>. Since the (total) degree of <span class="math">P_{1}</span> is at most <span class="math">q^{3}+q</span>, restricting to the component of the curve defined by <span class="math">P_{1}</span> and using the Weil bound for possibly singular plane curves gives a lower bound on the cardinality of <span class="math">C(K)</span> which is large enough to prove the theorem after accounting for projective points and points with second coordinate in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2}}</span>. This argument is given in the next subsection before dealing with the more involved main step.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For proving the main step the action of <span class="math">\\mathrm{PGl}_{2}(\\mathbb{F}_{q})</span> on the variable <span class="math">U</span> is considered. An absolutely irreducible factor <span class="math">P_{1}</span> of <span class="math">P</span> is stabilised by a subgroup <span class="math">S_{1}\\subset\\mathrm{PGl}_{2}(\\mathbb{F}_{q})</span> satisfying some conditions. The first step is to show that, after possibly switching to another absolutely irreducible factor, there are only a few cases for the subgroup. Then for each case it is shown that the factor is defined over <span class="math">K[A,U]</span> or that one of the conditions on the parameters is not satisfied.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proving the propositions will be done in the final subsection.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A.4 <span class="math">\\mathbf{PGl}_2</span> action</p>

A matrix <span class="math">\\begin{pmatrix} a &amp;amp; b \\\\ c &amp;amp; d \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathrm{PGl}_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span> acts on <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}^1(M)</span>, <span class="math">M</span> an arbitrary field containing <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>, by <span class="math">(x_0 : x_1) \\mapsto \\begin{pmatrix} a &amp;amp; b \\\\ c &amp;amp; d \\end{pmatrix} (x_0 : x_1) = (ax_0 + bx_1 : cx_0 + dx_1)</span> or, via <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}^1(M) = M \\cup \\{\\infty\\}</span>, by <span class="math">x \\mapsto \\frac{ax + b}{cx + d}</span>. This is an action on the left, i.e., for <span class="math">\\sigma, \\tau \\in \\mathrm{PGl}_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span> and <span class="math">x \\in \\mathbb{P}^1(M)</span> the following holds: <span class="math">\\sigma(\\tau(x)) = (\\sigma\\tau)(x)</span>. On a homogeneous polynomial <span class="math">H</span> in the variables <span class="math">(X_0 : X_1)</span> the action of <span class="math">\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} a &amp;amp; b \\\\ c &amp;amp; d \\end{pmatrix}</span> is given by <span class="math">H^\\sigma(X_0 : X_1) = H(aX_0 + bX_1 : cX_0 + dX_1)</span>. This is an action on the right, satisfying <span class="math">H^{(\\sigma\\tau)} = (H^\\sigma)^\\tau</span>. In the following we will usually use this action on the dehomogenised polynomials given by <span class="math">H^\\sigma(X) = H\\left(\\frac{aX + b}{cX + d}\\right)</span>, clearing denominators in the appropriate way.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The polynomial <span class="math">P \\in (K[A])[U]</span> is invariant under <span class="math">\\mathrm{PGl}_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span> acting on the variable <span class="math">U</span>; this can be checked by considering the actions of <span class="math">\\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; b \\\\ 0 &amp;amp; 1 \\end{pmatrix}</span>, <span class="math">\\begin{pmatrix} a &amp;amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp;amp; 1 \\end{pmatrix}</span> and <span class="math">\\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp;amp; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp;amp; 0 \\end{pmatrix}</span>, and noticing that <span class="math">\\mathrm{PGl}_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span> is generated by these matrices.

Notice that <span class="math">s</span> must divide <span class="math">F^q</span> and <span class="math">G^{q+1}</span>, hence it divides a power of <span class="math">\\gcd(F, G)</span>. Condition <span class="math">(*)</span> implies that <span class="math">\\gcd(F, G)</span> is either constant or of degree two.

Then <span class="math">\\mathrm{PGl}_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span> permutes the set <span class="math">\\{r_i\\}</span> and, since fixed points of <span class="math">\\mathrm{PGl}_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span> lie in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}</span> but <span class="math">r_i \\notin \\mathbb{F}_{q^2}</span>, the action is free.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Therefore the action on the decomposition over <span class="math">\\overline{K}[A, U]</span> is also transitive (adjusting the <span class="math">P_i</span> by scalars in <span class="math">\\overline{K}[A]</span> if necessary). Denoting by <span class="math">S_i \\subset \\mathrm{PGl}_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span> the stabiliser of <span class="math">P_i</span> it follows that all <span class="math">S_i</span> are conjugates of each other, thus they have the same cardinality and hence <span class="math">q^3 - q = g \\cdot \\# S_i</span>. Moreover the degree of <span class="math">P_i</span> in <span class="math">U</span> is constant, namely <span class="math">\\# S_i</span>, and also the degree of <span class="math">P_i</span> in <span class="math">A</span> is constant, thus <span class="math">g \\mid q^2 + q = \\deg_A(P)</span>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Therefore <span class="math">h_{1}(X^{q})X-h_{0}(X^{q})</span> is divisible by <span class="math">Q^{(1/q)}(X)</span> and <span class="math">Q</span> is a trap of level <span class="math">0</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the case <span class="math">j=1</span> an analogous calculation shows that <span class="math">-\\rho_{i}^{q}</span>, <span class="math">i=1,2</span>, are roots of <span class="math">h_{1}Y^{q^{kd-1}}-h_{0}</span>, namely for <span class="math">(Y+u_{1},-u_{0})</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Therefore <span class="math">h_{1}Y^{q^{kd-1}}-h_{0}</span> is divisible by <span class="math">Q</span>, hence <span class="math">Q</span> is a trap of level <span class="math">kd</span>. This finishes the proof of Proposition 1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The assertion in Proposition 2 about the number of traps follows easily from considering the degrees of <span class="math">h_{1}Y^{q^{d^{\\prime}-1}}-h_{0}</span> and <span class="math">h_{1}^{q}Y-h_{0}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the other assertion, note that a solution <span class="math">(a,B)</span> gives rise to the polynomial <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{a}=a(u_{0}X+(Y+u_{1}))+((Y+v_{0})X+v_{1})</span>. If, for <span class="math">j=1</span> or <span class="math">j=2</span>, <span class="math">\\rho</span> is a root of <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\bmod f_{j}</span> for two different values of <span class="math">a</span>, then <span class="math">\\rho</span> is a root of <span class="math">u_{0}X+(Y+u_{1})\\bmod f_{j}</span> and of <span class="math">(Y+v_{0})X+v_{1}\\bmod f_{j}</span>. In the case <span class="math">j=1</span> the polynomial <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\bmod f_{1}</span> splits completely, hence <span class="math">\\rho\\in K</span>, and <span class="math">\\rho</span> is also a root of</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">X(u_{0}X+(Y+u_{1}))-(Y+v_{0})X-v_{1}\\bmod f_{1}=u_{0}X^{2}+(u_{1}-v_{0})X-v_{1}=-F(-X),</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">contradicting the irreducibility of <span class="math">Q</span>. In the other case <span class="math">\\rho</span> is a root of any <span class="math">w_{0}X+w_{1}\\bmod f_{2}</span> with <span class="math">(w_{0},w_{1})\\in L_{Q}</span>. For <span class="math">w_{0}=Q,w_{1}=0</span> and for <span class="math">w_{0}=0,w_{1}=Q</span> one obtains that <span class="math">\\rho</span> is a root of <span class="math">Qh_{0}</span> and of <span class="math">Qh_{1}</span>, respectively. Since <span class="math">h_{0}</span> and <span class="math">h_{1}</span> are co-prime, <span class="math">\\rho</span> is a root of <span class="math">Q</span>, completing the proof of Proposition 2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark: For the sake of simplicity the definition of traps of level <span class="math">d^{\\prime}&gt;0</span> was extended to some polynomials that can be eliminated by the basic building block. However, if <span class="math">d^{\\prime}</span> is even, a trap polynomial <span class="math">Q=(Y+\\rho_{1}^{q})(Y+\\rho_{2}^{q})\\in\\mathbb{F}_{q^{d^{\\prime}}}[Y]</span>, <span class="math">\\rho_{1},\\rho_{2}\\in\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2d^{\\prime}}}\\setminus\\mathbb{F}_{q^{d^{\\prime}}}</span>, cannot be eliminated via the basic building block. Assuming the contrary, let <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{a}=XY+aY+bX+c\\in\\mathbb{F}_{q^{d^{\\prime}}}[X,Y]</span> be a polynomial that gives rise to an elimination. Then <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{a}\\bmod f_{1}=X^{q+1}+aX^{q}+bX+c</span> splits into <span class="math">q+1</span> distinct linear factors over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{d^{\\prime}}}</span>. Since it divides <span class="math">X^{q^{d^{\\prime}}}-X</span>, the polynomial <span class="math">X^{q+q^{d^{\\prime}}}+aX^{q}+bX^{q^{d^{\\prime}}}+c</span> has at least <span class="math">q+1</span> distinct roots in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{d^{\\prime}}}</span>, so its <span class="math">q</span>-th root</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\tilde{\\mathcal{P}}=X^{q^{d^{\\prime}-1}+1}+\\tilde{b}X^{q^{d^{\\prime}-1}}+\\tilde{a}X+\\tilde{c}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">also has at least <span class="math">q + 1</span> distinct roots in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{d&#x27;}}</span>. Hence <span class="math">\\tilde{\\mathcal{P}}</span> splits completely over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{d&#x27;(d&#x27; - 1)}}</span>. Furthermore <span class="math">Q</span> divides <span class="math">(Y + b)h_0 + (aY + c)h_1</span> and <span class="math">h_1Y^{q^{d&#x27; - 1}} - h_0</span>, so <span class="math">Q</span> divides <span class="math">Y^{q^{d&#x27; - 1} + 1} + bY^{q^{d&#x27; - 1}} + aY + c</span> and the latter polynomial has the roots <span class="math">-\\rho_i^q</span>, <span class="math">i = 1,2</span>. Therefore <span class="math">\\tilde{P}</span> has the roots <span class="math">-\\rho_i</span>, <span class="math">i = 1,2</span>. For even <span class="math">d&#x27;</span> this is a contradiction since <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2d&#x27;}}</span> is not a subfield of <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{d&#x27;(d&#x27; - 1)}}</span>. This shows that such <span class="math">Q</span> cannot be eliminated via the basic building block.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the other representation, namely <span class="math">f_{2} = \\tilde{h}_{1}Y - \\tilde{h}_{0}</span> with <span class="math">\\tilde{h}_i\\in \\mathbb{F}_{q^k}[X]</span>, the trap avoidance arguments follow mutatis mutandis.</p>

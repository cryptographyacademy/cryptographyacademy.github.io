      <p class="text-gray-300">We study the problem of constructing proof systems that achieve both soundness and zero knowledge unconditionally (without relying on intractability assumptions). Known techniques for this goal are primarily <em>combinatorial</em>, despite the fact that constructions of interactive proofs (IPs) and probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs) heavily rely on <em>algebraic</em> techniques to achieve their properties.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We present simple and natural modifications of well-known 'algebraic' IP and PCP protocols that achieve unconditional (perfect) zero knowledge in recently introduced models, overcoming limitations of known techniques.</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-1 my-2">
        <li>We modify the PCP of Ben-Sasson and Sudan [\[BS08\]](#page-57-0) to obtain zero knowledge for NEXP in the model of Interactive Oracle Proofs [\[BCS16,](#page-56-0) [RRR16\]](#page-58-0), where the verifier, in each round, receives a PCP from the prover.</li>
        <li>We modify the IP of Lund, Fortnow, Karloff, and Nisan [\[LFKN92\]](#page-58-1) to obtain zero knowledge for #P in the model of Interactive PCPs [\[KR08\]](#page-58-2), where the verifier first receives a PCP from the prover and then interacts with him.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The simulators in our zero knowledge protocols rely on solving a problem that lies at the intersection of coding theory, linear algebra, and computational complexity, which we call the <em>succinct constraint detection</em> problem, and consists of detecting dual constraints with polynomial support size for codes of exponential block length. Our two results rely on solutions to this problem for fundamental classes of linear codes:</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">The study of interactive proofs (IPs) [\[BM88,](#page-57-1) [GMR89\]](#page-57-2) that unconditionally achieve zero knowledge [\[GMR89\]](#page-57-2) has led to a rich theory, with connections well beyond zero knowledge. For example, the class of languages with statistical zero knowledge IPs, which we denote by SZK-IP, has complete problems that make no reference to either zero knowledge or interaction [\[SV03,](#page-58-4) [GV99\]](#page-57-3) and is closed under complement [\[Oka00,](#page-58-5) [Vad99\]](#page-59-0). Despite the fact that all PSPACE languages have IPs [\[Sha92\]](#page-58-6), SZK-IP is contained in AM ∩ coAM, and thus NP is not in SZK-IP unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses [\[BHZ87\]](#page-57-4); one consequence is that Graph Non-Isomorphism is unlikely to be NP-complete. Moreover, constructing SZK-IP for a language is equivalent to constructing instance-dependent commitments for the language [\[IOS97,](#page-58-7) [OV08\]](#page-58-8), and has connections to other fundamental information-theoretic notions like randomized encodings [\[AR16,](#page-56-3) [VV15\]](#page-59-1) and secret-sharing schemes [\[VV15\]](#page-59-1).</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Unconditional zero knowledge in other models behaves very differently. Ben-Or, Goldwasser, Kilian, and Wigderson [\[BGKW88\]](#page-56-4) introduced the model of multi-prover interactive proofs (MIPs) and showed that <em>all</em> such proofs can be made zero knowledge unconditionally. The analogous statement for IPs is equivalent to the existence of one-way functions, as shown by [\[GMR89,](#page-57-2) [IY87,](#page-58-9) [BGG](#page-56-5)+88] in one direction and by [\[Ost91,](#page-58-10) [OW93\]](#page-58-11) in the other (unless BPP = PSPACE, in which case the statement is trivial). Subsequent works not only established that all NEXP languages have MIPs [\[BFL91\]](#page-56-6), but also led to formulating probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs) and proving the celebrated PCP Theorem [\[FRS88,](#page-57-5) [BFLS91,](#page-56-7) [FGL](#page-57-6)<sup>+</sup>96, [AS98,](#page-56-8) [ALM](#page-56-9)<sup>+</sup>98], as well as constructing statistical zero knowledge PCPs [\[KPT97\]](#page-58-12) and applying them to black-box cryptography [\[IMS12,](#page-58-13) [IMSX15\]](#page-58-14).</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The theory of zero knowledge for these types of proofs, however, is not as rich as in the case of IPs. Most notably, known techniques to achieve zero knowledge MIPs or PCPs are limited, and come with caveats. Zero knowledge MIPs are obtained via complex generic transformations [\[BGKW88\]](#page-56-4), assume the full power of the PCP Theorem [\[DFK](#page-57-7)<sup>+</sup>92], or support only languages in NP [\[LS95\]](#page-58-15). Zero knowledge PCPs are obtained via a construction that incurs polynomial blowups in proof length and requires the honest verifier to adaptively query the PCP [\[KPT97\]](#page-58-12). Alternative approaches are not known, despite attempts to find them. For example, [\[IWY16\]](#page-58-16) apply PCPs to leakage-resilient circuits, obtaining PCPs for NP that do have a non-adaptive honest verifier but are only witness indistinguishable.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Even basic questions such as "are there zero-knowledge PCPs of quasilinear-size?" or "are there zero-knowledge PCPs with non-adaptive honest verifiers?" have remained frustratingly hard to answer, despite the fact the answers to these questions are well understood when removing the requirement of zero knowledge. This state of affairs begs the question of whether a richer theory about zero knowledge MIPs and PCPs could be established.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The current situation is that known techniques to achieve zero knowledge MIPs and PCPs are combinatorial, namely they make black-box use of an underlying MIP or PCP, despite the fact that most MIP and PCP constructions have a rich algebraic structure arising from the use of error correcting codes based on evaluations of low-degree polynomials. This separation is certainly an attractive feature, and perhaps even unsurprising: while error-correcting codes are designed to help recover information, zero knowledge proofs are designed to hide it.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Yet, a recent work by Ben-Sasson, Chiesa, Gabizon, and Virza [\[BCGV16\]](#page-56-10) brings together linear error correcting codes and zero knowledge using an algebraic technique that we refer to as 'masking'. The paper introduces a "2-round PCP" for NP that unconditionally achieves zero knowledge and, nevertheless, has both quasilinear size and a nonadaptive honest verifier. Their work can be viewed not only as partial progress towards some of the open questions above, but also as studying the power of zero knowledge for a natural extension of PCPs ("multi-round PCPs" as discussed below) with its own motivations and applications [\[BCS16,](#page-56-0) [RRR16,](#page-58-0) [BCG](#page-56-11)<sup>+</sup>17].</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The motivation of this work is to understand the power of algebraic tools, such as linear error correcting codes, for achieving zero knowledge unconditionally (without relying on intractability assumptions).</p>
      <h2 id="span-id-page-2-1-span-1-1-results" class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4"><span id="page-2-1"></span>1.1 Results</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We present new protocols that unconditionally achieve soundness and zero knowledge in recently suggested models that combine features of PCPs and IPs [\[KR08,](#page-58-2) [BCS16,](#page-56-0) [RRR16\]](#page-58-0). Our protocols consist of simple and natural modifications to well-known constructions: the PCP of Ben-Sasson and Sudan [\[BS08\]](#page-57-0) and the IP for polynomial summation of Lund, Fortnow, Karloff, and Nisan [\[LFKN92\]](#page-58-1). By leveraging the linear codes used in these constructions, we reduce the problem of achieving zero knowledge to solving exponentially-large instances of a new linear-algebraic problem that we call <em>constraint detection</em>, which we believe to be of independent interest. We design efficient algorithms for solving</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">this problem for notable linear code families, along the way exploiting connections to algebraic complexity theory and local views of linear codes. We now elaborate on the above by discussing each of our results.</p>
      <h4 id="1-1-1-zero-knowledge-for-non-deterministic-exponential-time" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1.1.1 Zero knowledge for non-deterministic exponential time</h4>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Two recent works [\[BCS16,](#page-56-0) [RRR16\]](#page-58-0) independently introduce and study the notion of an <em>interactive oracle proof</em> (IOP), which can be viewed as a "multi-round PCP". Informally, an IOP is an IP modified so that, whenever the prover sends to the verifier a message, the verifier does not have to read the message in full but may probabilistically query it. Namely, in every round, the verifier sends the prover a message, and the prover replies with a PCP. IOPs enjoy better efficiency compared to PCPs [\[BCG](#page-56-11)+17], and have applications to constructing argument systems [\[BCS16\]](#page-56-0) and IPs [\[RRR16\]](#page-58-0).</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The aforementioned work of [\[BCGV16\]](#page-56-10) makes a simple modification to the PCP of Ben-Sasson and Sudan [\[BS08\]](#page-57-0) and obtains a 2-round IOP for NP that is perfect zero knowledge, and yet has quasilinear size and a non-adaptive honest verifier. Our first result consists of extending this prior work to all languages in NEXP, positively answering an open question raised there. We do so by constructing, for each time T and query bound b, a suitable IOP for NTIME(T) that is zero knowledge against query bound b; the result for NEXP follows by setting b to be super-polynomial.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The foregoing notion of zero knowledge for IOPs directly extends that for PCPs, and requires showing the existence of an algorithm that simulates the view of any (malicious and adaptive) verifier interacting with the honest prover and making at most b queries across all oracles; here, 'view' consists of the answers to queries across all oracles.[1](#page-3-0)</p>
      <span id="page-3-2"></span>Theorem 1.1 (informal statement of Thm. [8.1\)](#page-39-1). *For every time bound* T *and query bound* b*, the complexity class* NTIME(T) *has* 2*-round Interactive Oracle Proofs that are perfect zero knowledge against* b *queries, and where the proof length is* O˜(T + b) *and the (honest verifier's) query complexity is* polylog(T + b)*.*
      <p class="text-gray-300">The prior work of [\[BCGV16\]](#page-56-10) was "stuck" at NP because their simulator runs in poly(T + b) time so that T, b must be polynomially-bounded. In contrast, we achieve all of NEXP by constructing, for essentially the same simple 2-round IOP, a simulator that runs in time poly(˜q + log T + log b), where q˜ is the <em>actual</em> number of queries made by the malicious verifier. This is an <em>exponential</em> improvement in simulation efficiency, and we obtain it by conceptualizing and solving a linear-algebraic problem about Reed–Solomon codes, and their proximity proofs, as discussed in Section [1.1.3.](#page-4-0)</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">In sum, our theorem gives new tradeoffs compared to [\[KPT97\]](#page-58-12)'s result, which gives statistical zero knowledge PCPs for NTIME(T) with proof length poly(T, b) and an adaptive honest verifier. We obtain perfect zero knowledge for NTIME(T), with quasilinear proof length and a non-adaptive honest verifier, at the price of "2 rounds of PCPs".</p>
      <h4 id="1-1-2-zero-knowledge-for-counting-problems" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1.1.2 Zero knowledge for counting problems</h4>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Kalai and Raz [\[KR08\]](#page-58-2) introduce and study the notion of <em>interactive PCPs</em> (IPCPs), which "sits in between" IPs and IOPs: the prover first sends the verifier a PCP, and then the prover and verifier engage in a standard IP. IPCPs also enjoy better efficiency compared to PCPs or IPs alone [\[KR08\]](#page-58-2).</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We show how a natural and simple modification of the sumcheck protocol of Lund, Fortnow, Karloff, and Nisan [\[LFKN92\]](#page-58-1) achieves perfect zero knowledge in the IPCP model, even with a non-adaptive honest verifier. By running this protocol on the usual arithmetization of the counting problem associated to 3SAT, we obtain our second result, which is IPCPs for #P that are <em>perfect zero knowledge against unbounded queries</em>. This means that there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that simulates the view of any (malicious and adaptive) verifier making any polynomial number of queries to the PCP oracle. Here, 'view' consists of answers to oracle queries and the transcript of interaction with the prover. (In particular, this notion of zero knowledge is a 'hybrid' of corresponding notions for PCPs and IPs.)</p>
      <span id="page-3-1"></span>Theorem 1.2 (informal statement of Thm. [6.2\)](#page-33-1). *The complexity class* #P *has Interactive PCPs that are perfect zero knowledge against unbounded queries. The PCP proof length is exponential, and the communication complexity of the interaction and the (honest verifier's) query complexity are polynomial.*
      <p class="text-gray-300">Our construction relies on a random self-reducibility property of the sumcheck protocol (see Section [2.2.2](#page-9-0) for a summary) and its completeness and soundness properties are straightforward to establish. As in our previous result, the</p>
      <span id="page-3-0"></span><sup>1</sup>More precisely, while in a zero knowledge IP or MIP one is required to simulate the entire transcript of interaction (with one or multiple provers), in a zero knowledge IOP or PCP one is merely required to simulate answers to the oracle queries but not the entire oracle.
      <p class="text-gray-300">"magic" lies in the construction of the simulator, which must solve the same type of exponentially-large linear-algebraic problem, except that this time it is about Reed–Muller codes rather than Reed–Solomon codes. The algorithm that we give to solve this task relies on connections to the problem of polynomial identity testing in the area of algebraic complexity theory, as we discuss further below.</p>
      <span id="page-4-1"></span>Goyal, Ishai, Mahmoody, and Sahai [GIMS10] also study zero knowledge for IPCPs, and show how to obtain IPCPs for NP that (i) are statistical zero knowledge against unbounded queries, and yet (ii) each location of the (necessarily) super-polynomial size PCP is polynomial-time computable given the NP witness. They further prove that these two properties are not attainable by zero knowledge PCPs. Their construction consists of replacing the commitment scheme in the zero knowledge IP for 3-colorability of [GMW91] with an information-theoretic analogue in the IPCP model. Our Theorem 1.2 also achieves zero knowledge against unbounded queries, but targets the complexity class #P (rather than NP), for which there is no clear analogue of property (ii) above.
      <p class="text-gray-300">Information-theoretic commitments also underlie the construction of zero knowledge PCPs [KPT97]. One could apply the [KPT97] result for <strong>NEXP</strong> to obtain zero knowledge PCPs (thus also IPCPs) for #P, but this is an indirect and complex route (in particular, it relies on the PCP Theorem) that, moreover, yields an adaptive honest verifier. Our direct construction is simple and natural, and also yields a non-adaptive honest verifier.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We now discuss the common algebraic structure that allowed us to obtain both of the above results. We believe that further progress in understanding these types of algebraic techniques will lead to further progress in understanding the power of unconditional zero knowledge for IOPs and IPCPs, and perhaps also for MIPs and PCPs.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">The constructions underlying both of our theorems achieve zero knowledge by applying a simple modification to well-known protocols: the PCP of Ben-Sasson and Sudan [BS08] underlies our result for <strong>NEXP</strong> and the sumcheck protocol of Lund, Fortnow, Karloff, and Nisan [LFKN92] underlies our result for #P.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">In both of these protocols the verifier has access (either via a polynomial-size representation or via a PCP oracle) to an exponentially-large word that allegedly belongs to a certain linear code, and the prover 'leaks' hard-to-compute information in the process of convincing the verifier that this word belongs to the linear code. We achieve zero knowledge via a modification that we call <em>masking</em>: the prover sends to the verifier a PCP containing a random codeword in this code, and then convinces the verifier that the <em>sum</em> of these two (the original codeword and this random codeword) is close to the linear code.<sup>2</sup> Intuitively, zero knowledge comes from the fact that the prover now argues about a random shift of the original word.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">However, this idea raises a problem: how does the simulator 'sample' an exponentially-large random codeword in order to answer the verifier's queries to the PCP? Solving this problem crucially relies on solving a problem that lies at the intersection of coding theory, linear algebra, and computational complexity, which we call the <em>constraint detection problem</em>. We informally introduce it and state our results about it, and defer to Section 2.2 a more detailed discussion of its connection to zero knowledge.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Detecting constraints in codes.</strong> Constraint detection is the problem of determining which linear relations hold across all codewords of a linear code  <span class="math">C \subseteq \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^D</span> , when considering only a given subdomain  <span class="math">I \subseteq D</span>  of the code rather than all of the domain D. This problem can always be solved in time that is polynomial in |D| (via Gaussian elimination); however, if there is an algorithm that solves this problem in time that is <em>polynomial in the subdomain's size</em> |I|, rather than the domain's size |D|, then we say that the code has <em>succinct</em> constraint detection; in particular, the domain could have <em>exponential</em> size and the algorithm would still run in polynomial time.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 1.3</strong> (informal). We say that a linear code  <span class="math">C \subseteq \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^D</span>  has <strong>succinct constraint detection</strong> if there exists an algorithm that, given a subset  <span class="math">I \subseteq D</span> , runs in time  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;poly&#125;(\log |\mathbb&#123;F&#125;| + \log |D| + |I|)</span>  and outputs  <span class="math">z \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^I</span>  such that  <span class="math">\sum_&#123;i \in I&#125; z(i)w(i) = 0</span>  for all  <span class="math">w \in C</span> , or "no" if no such z exists. (In particular, |D| may be exponential.)</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We further discuss the problem of constraint detection in Section 2.1, and provide a formal treatment of it in Section 4.1. Beyond this introduction, we shall use (and achieve) a stronger definition of constraint detection: the algorithm is required to output a basis for the space of dual codewords in  <span class="math">C^&#123;\perp&#125;</span>  whose support lies in the subdomain I, i.e., a basis for</p>
      <span id="page-4-2"></span><sup>&</sup>lt;sup&gt;2</sup>This is reminiscent of the use of a random secret share of 0 to achieve privacy in information-theoretic multi-party protocols [BGW88].
      <p class="text-gray-300">the space  <span class="math">\&#123;z \in D^I: \forall w \in C, \sum_&#123;i \in I&#125; z(i)w(i) = 0\&#125;</span> . Note that in our discussion of succinct constraint detection we do not leverage the distance property of the code C, but we do leverage it in our eventual applications.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Our zero knowledge simulators' strategy includes sampling a "random PCP": a random codeword w in a linear code C with exponentially large domain size |D| (see Section 2.2 for more on this). Explicitly sampling w requires time  <span class="math">\Omega(|D|)</span> , and so is inefficient. But a verifier makes only polynomially-many queries to w, so the simulator has to only simulate w when restricted to polynomial-size sets  <span class="math">I \subseteq D</span> , leaving open the possibility of doing so in time  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;poly&#125;(|I|)</span> . Achieving such a simulation time is an instance of (efficiently and perfectly) "implementing a huge random object" [GGN10] via a  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;stateful&#125;</span>  algorithm [BW04]. We observe that if C has succinct constraint detection then this sampling problem for C has a solution: the simulator maintains the set  <span class="math">\&#123;(i,a_i)\&#125;_&#123;i\in I&#125;</span>  of past query-answer pairs; then, on a new verifier query  <span class="math">j\in D</span> , the simulator uses constraint detection to determine if  <span class="math">w_j</span>  is linearly dependent on  <span class="math">w_I</span> , and answers accordingly (such linear dependencies characterize the required probability distribution, see Lemma 4.3).</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Overall, our paper thus provides an application (namely, obtaining zero knowledge simulators) where the problem of efficient implementation of huge random objects arises naturally.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We now state our results about succinct constraint detection.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">(1) <strong>Reed–Muller codes, and their partial sums.</strong> We prove that the family of linear codes comprised of evaluations of low-degree multivariate polynomials, along with their partial sums, has succinct constraint detection. This family is closely related to the <em>sumcheck protocol</em> [LFKN92], and indeed we use this result to obtain a PZK analogue of the sumcheck protocol (see Section 2.2.2 and Section 5), which yields Theorem 1.2 (see Section 2.3.1 and Section 6).</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Recall that the family of Reed–Muller codes, denoted RM, is indexed by tuples  <span class="math">n = (\mathbb&#123;F&#125;, m, d)</span> , where  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span>  is a finite field and m, d are positive integers, and the n-th code consists of codewords  <span class="math">w \colon \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^m \to \mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span>  that are the evaluation of an m-variate polynomial Q of individual degree less than d over  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span> . We denote by  <span class="math">\Sigma RM</span>  the family that extends RM with evaluations of all partial sums over certain subcubes of a hypercube:</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 1.4</strong> (informal). We denote by  <span class="math">\Sigma RM</span>  the linear code family that is indexed by tuples  <span class="math">\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;=(\mathbb&#123;F&#125;,m,d,H)</span> , where H is a subset of  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span> , and where the  <span class="math">\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;</span> -th code consists of codewords  <span class="math">(w_0,\ldots,w_m)</span>  such that there exists an m-variate polynomial Q of individual degree less than d over  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span>  for which  <span class="math">w_i \colon \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;m-i&#125; \to \mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span>  is the evaluation of the i-th partial sum of Q over H, i.e,  <span class="math">w_i(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;) = \sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\gamma&#125; \in H^i&#125; Q(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;, \vec&#123;\gamma&#125;)</span>  for every  <span class="math">\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;m-i&#125;</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The domain size for codes in  <span class="math">\Sigma RM</span>  is  <span class="math">\Omega(|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;|^m)</span> , but our detector's running time is exponentially smaller.</p>
      <span id="page-5-0"></span>**Theorem 1.5** (informal statement of Thm. 4.9). The family  $\Sigma RM$  has succinct constraint detection: there is a detector algorithm for  $\Sigma RM$  that runs in time poly( $\log |\mathbb&#123;F&#125;| + m + d + |H| + |I|$ ).
      <p class="text-gray-300">We provide intuition for the theorem's proof in Section 2.1.1 and provide the proof's details in Section 4.2; the proof leverages tools from algebraic complexity theory. (Our proof also shows that the family RM, which is a restriction of  <span class="math">\Sigma RM</span> , has succinct constraint detection.) Our theorem implies perfect and stateful implementation of a random low-degree multivariate polynomial and its partial sums over any hypercube; our proof extends an algorithm of [BW04], which solves this problem in the case of parity queries to boolean functions on subcubes of the boolean hypercube.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">(2) <strong>Reed–Solomon codes, and their PCPPs.</strong> Second, we prove that the family of linear codes comprised of evaluations of low-degree univariate polynomials concatenated with corresponding BS proximity proofs [BS08] has succinct constraint detection. This family is closely related to quasilinear-size PCPs for <strong>NEXP</strong> [BS08], and indeed we use this result to obtain PZK proximity proofs for this family (see Section 2.2.3 and Section 7), from which we derive Theorem 1.1 (see Section 2.3.2 and Section 8).</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 1.6</strong> (informal). We denote by BS-RS the linear code family indexed by tuples  <span class="math">\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;=(\mathbb&#123;F&#125;,L,d)</span> , where  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span>  is an extension field of  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_2</span> , L is a linear subspace in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span> , and d is a positive integer; the  <span class="math">\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;</span> -th code consists of evaluations on L of univariate polynomials Q of degree less than d, concatenated with corresponding [BS08] proximity proofs.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The domain size for codes in BS-RS is  <span class="math">\Omega(|L|)</span> , but our detector's running time is exponentially smaller.</p>
      <span id="page-5-1"></span>**Theorem 1.7** (informal statement of Thm. 4.12). *The family* BS-RS *has succinct constraint detection:* there is a detector algorithm for BS-RS that runs in time poly( $\log |\mathbb&#123;F&#125;| + \dim(L) + |I|$ ).
      <p class="text-gray-300">We provide intuition for the theorem's proof in Section 2.1.2 and provide the proof's details in Section 4.3; the proof leverages combinatorial properties of the recursive construction of BS proximity proofs.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">We informally discuss intuition behind our algorithms for detecting constraints (Section 2.1), their connection to zero knowledge (Section 2.2), and how we derive our results about #P and NEXP (Section 2.3). Throughout, we provide pointers to the technical sections that contain further details.</p>
      <h4 id="span-id-page-6-1-span-2-1-detecting-constraints-for-exponentially-large-codes" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2"><span id="page-6-1"></span>2.1 Detecting constraints for exponentially-large codes</h4>
      <p class="text-gray-300">As informally introduced in Section 1.1.3, the <em>constraint detection problem</em> corresponding to a linear code family  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;C&#125; = \&#123;C_&#123;\mathtt&#123;n&#125;&#125;\&#125;_&#123;\mathtt&#123;n&#125;&#125;</span>  with domain  <span class="math">D(\cdot)</span>  and alphabet  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;(\cdot)</span>  is the following: given an index  <span class="math">\mathtt&#123;n&#125; \in \&#123;0,1\&#125;^*</span>  and subset  <span class="math">I \subseteq D(\mathtt&#123;n&#125;)</span> , output a basis for the space  <span class="math">\&#123;z \in D(\mathtt&#123;n&#125;)^I : \forall w \in C_&#123;\mathtt&#123;n&#125;&#125;, \sum_&#123;i \in I&#125; z(i)w(i) = 0\&#125;</span> . In other words, for a given subdomain I, we wish to determine all linear relations that hold for codewords in  <span class="math">C_&#123;\mathtt&#123;n&#125;&#125;</span>  restricted to the subdomain I.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">If a generating matrix for  <span class="math">C_n</span>  can be found in polynomial time, this problem can be solved in  <span class="math">poly(|\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;|+|D(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;)|)</span>  time via Gaussian elimination (such an approach was implicitly taken by [BCGV16] to construct a perfect zero knowledge simulator for an IOP for NP). However, in our setting  <span class="math">|D(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;)|</span>  is <em>exponential</em> in  <span class="math">|\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;|</span> , so the straightforward solution is inefficient. With this in mind, we say that  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;C&#125;</span>  has <em>succinct constraint detection</em> if there exists an algorithm that solves its constraint detection problem in  <span class="math">poly(|\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;|+|I|)</span>  time, even if  <span class="math">|D(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;)|</span>  is exponential in  <span class="math">|\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;|</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The formal definition of succinct constraint detection is in Section 4.1. In the rest of this section we provide intuition for two of our theorems: succinct constraint detection for the family  <span class="math">\Sigma RM</span>  and for the family BS-RS. As will become evident, the techniques that we use to prove the two theorems differ significantly. Perhaps this is because the two codes are quite different:  <span class="math">\Sigma RM</span>  has a simple and well-understood algebraic structure, whereas BS-RS is constructed recursively using proof composition.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">The purpose of this section is to provide intuition about the proof of Theorem 1.5, which states that the family  <span class="math">\Sigma RM</span>  has succinct constraint detection. (Formal definitions, statements, and proofs are in Section 4.2.) We thus outline how to construct an algorithm that detects constraints for the family of linear codes comprised of evaluations of low-degree multivariate polynomials, along with their partial sums. Our construction generalizes the proof of [BW04], which solves the special case of parity queries to boolean functions on subcubes of the boolean hypercube by reducing this problem to a probabilistic identity testing problem that is solvable via an algorithm of [RS05].</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Below, we temporarily ignore the partial sums, and focus on constructing an algorithm that detects constraints for the family of Reed–Muller codes RM, and at the end of the section we indicate how we can also handle partial sums.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Step 1: phrase as linear algebra problem. Consider a codeword  <span class="math">w \colon \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^m \to \mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span>  that is the evaluation of an m-variate polynomial Q of individual degree less than d over  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span> . Note that, for every  <span class="math">\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^m</span> ,  <span class="math">w(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)</span>  equals the inner product of Q's coefficients with the vector  <span class="math">\phi_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;&#125;</span>  that consists of the evaluation of all  <span class="math">d^m</span>  monomials at  <span class="math">\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;</span> . One can argue that constraint detection for RM is equivalent to finding the nullspace of  <span class="math">\&#123;\phi_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;&#125;\&#125;_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in I&#125;</span> . However, "writing out" this  <span class="math">|I| \times d^m</span>  matrix and performing Gaussian elimination is too expensive, so we must solve this linear algebra problem <em>succinctly</em>.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Step 2: encode vectors as coefficients of polynomials. While each vector  <span class="math">\phi_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;&#125;</span>  is long, it has a succinct description; in fact, we can construct an m-variate polynomial  <span class="math">\Phi_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;&#125;</span>  whose coefficients (after expansion) are the entries of  <span class="math">\phi_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;&#125;</span> , but has an arithmetic circuit of only size O(md): namely,  <span class="math">\Phi_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;&#125;(\vec&#123;X&#125;) := \prod_&#123;i=1&#125;^&#123;m&#125; (1 + \alpha_i X_i + \alpha_i^2 X_i^2 + \dots + \alpha_i^&#123;d-1&#125; X_i^&#123;d-1&#125;)</span> . Computing the nullspace of  <span class="math">\&#123;\Phi_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;&#125;\&#125;_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in I&#125;</span>  is thus equivalent to computing the nullspace of  <span class="math">\&#123;\phi_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;&#125;\&#125;_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in I&#125;</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Step 3: computing the nullspace.</strong> Computing the nullspace of a set of polynomials is a problem in algebraic complexity theory, and is essentially equivalent to the Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT) problem, and so we leverage tools from that area.<sup>3</sup> While there are simple randomized algorithms to solve this problem (see for example [Kay10, Lemma 8] and [BW04]), these algorithms, due to a nonzero probability of error, suffice to achieve statistical zero knowledge but do not suffice to achieve perfect zero knowledge. To obtain perfect zero knowledge, we need a solution that has <em>no probability of error</em>. Derandomizing PIT for arbitrary algebraic circuits seems to be beyond current</p>
      <span id="page-6-3"></span><sup>&</sup>lt;sup&gt;3</sup>PIT is the following problem: given a polynomial f expressed as an algebraic circuit, is f identically zero? This problem has well-known randomized algorithms [Zip79, Sch80], but deterministic algorithms for all circuits seem to be beyond current techniques [KI04]. PIT is a central problem in algebraic complexity theory, and suffices for solving a number of other algebraic problems. We refer the reader to [SY10] for a survey.
      <p class="text-gray-300">techniques (as it implies circuit lower bounds [KI04]), but derandomizations are currently known for some restricted circuit classes. The polynomials that we consider are special: they fall in the well-studied class of "sum of products of univariates", and for this case we can invoke the deterministic algorithm of [RS05] (see also [Kay10]). (It is interesting that derandomization techniques are ultimately used to obtain a qualitative improvement for an inherently probabilistic task, i.e., perfect sampling of verifier views.)</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The above provides an outline for how to detect constraints for RM. The extension to  <span class="math">\Sigma RM</span> , which also includes partial sums, is achieved by considering a more general form of vectors  <span class="math">\phi_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;&#125;</span>  as well as corresponding polynomials  <span class="math">\Phi_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;&#125;</span> . These polynomials also have the special form required for our derandomization. See Section 4.2 for details.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">Our construction leverages the recursive structure of BS proximity proofs: we identify key combinatorial properties of the recursion that enable "local" constraint detection. To define and argue these properties, we introduce two notions that play a central role throughout the proof:</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">``` A (local) view of a linear code C\subseteq \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^D is a pair (\tilde&#123;D&#125;,\tilde&#123;C&#125;) such that \tilde&#123;D&#125;\subseteq D and \tilde&#123;C&#125;=C|_&#123;\tilde&#123;D&#125;&#125;\subseteq \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;\tilde&#123;D&#125;&#125;.

      <p class="text-gray-300">Combinatorial properties of the recursive step. Given a finite field  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span> , domain  <span class="math">D \subseteq \mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span> , and degree d, let  <span class="math">C := \mathrm&#123;RS&#125;[\mathbb&#123;F&#125;, D, d]</span>  be the Reed-Solomon code consisting of evaluations on D of univariate polynomials of degree less than d over  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span> ; for concreteness, say that the domain size is  <span class="math">|D| = 2^n</span>  and the degree is  <span class="math">d = |D|/2 = 2^&#123;n-1&#125;</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The first level of [BS08]'s recursion appends to each codeword  <span class="math">f \in C</span>  an auxiliary function  <span class="math">\pi_1(f) \colon D' \to \mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span>  with domain D' disjoint from D.

That is, there exists  <span class="math">\kappa = O(\sqrt&#123;d&#125;)</span>  such that every partial assignment  <span class="math">h \colon \bigcup_&#123;\ell=1&#125;^&#123;\kappa&#125; \tilde&#123;D&#125;_&#123;j_\ell&#125; \to \mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span>  with  <span class="math">h|_&#123;\tilde&#123;D&#125;_&#123;j_\ell&#125;&#125; \in \tilde&#123;C&#125;_&#123;j_\ell&#125;</span>  (for each  <span class="math">\ell</span> ) equals the restriction to the subdomain  <span class="math">\bigcup_&#123;\ell=1&#125;^&#123;\kappa&#125; \tilde&#123;D&#125;_&#123;j_\ell&#125;</span>  of some codeword  <span class="math">f \| \pi_1(f)</span>  in  <span class="math">C^1</span> .</li>
        <li><span class="math">S^1</span>  is  <span class="math">O(\sqrt&#123;d&#125;)</span> -independent. The ability to extend locally-consistent assignments to "globally-consistent" codewords of  <span class="math">C^1</span>  holds in a stronger sense: even when the aforementioned partial assignment h is extended arbitrarily to  <span class="math">\kappa</span>  additional point-value pairs, this new partial assignment still equals the restriction of some codeword  <span class="math">f||\pi_1(f)|</span>  in  <span class="math">C^1</span> .</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The locality property alone already suffices to imply that, given a subdomain  <span class="math">I \subseteq D \cup D'</span>  of size  <span class="math">|I| &lt; \sqrt&#123;d&#125;</span> , we can solve the constraint detection problem on I by considering only those constraints that appear in views that intersect I (see Lemma 4.22). But C has exponential block length so a "quadratic speedup" does not yet imply succinct constraint detection. To obtain it, we also leverage the intersection and independence properties to reduce "locality" as follows.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Further recursive steps.</strong> So far we have only considered the first recursive step of a BS proximity proof; we show how to obtain covers with smaller locality (and thereby detect constraints with more efficiency) by considering additional recursive steps. Each code  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;C&#125;_j</span>  in the cover  <span class="math">S^1</span>  of  <span class="math">C^1</span>  is a Reed–Solomon code  <span class="math">\mathrm&#123;RS&#125;[\mathbb&#123;F&#125;, \tilde&#123;D&#125;_j, d_j]</span>  with  <span class="math">|\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j|, d_j = O(\sqrt&#123;d&#125;)</span> , and the next recursive step appends to each codeword in  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;C&#125;_j</span>  a corresponding auxiliary function, yielding a new code</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">C^2</span> . In turn,  <span class="math">C^2</span>  has a cover  <span class="math">S^2</span> , and another recursive step yields a new code  <span class="math">C^3</span> , which has its own cover  <span class="math">S^3</span> , and so on. The crucial technical observation (Lemma 4.20) is that the intersection and independence properties, which hold recursively, enable us to deduce that  <span class="math">C^i</span>  is 1-intersecting,  <span class="math">O(\sqrt[2^i]&#123;d&#125;)</span> -local, and  <span class="math">O(\sqrt[2^i]&#123;d&#125;)</span> -independent; in particular, for  <span class="math">r = \log \log d + O(1)</span> ,  <span class="math">S^r</span>  is 1-intersecting, O(1)-local, O(1)-independent.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Then, recalling that detecting constraints for local codes requires only the views in the cover that intersect I (Lemma 4.22), our constraint detector works by choosing  <span class="math">i \in \&#123;1, \dots, r\&#125;</span>  such that the cover  <span class="math">S^i</span>  is  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;poly&#125;(|I|)</span> -local, finding in this cover a  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;poly&#125;(|I|)</span> -size set of  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;poly&#125;(|I|)</span> -size views that intersect I, and computing in  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;poly&#125;(|I|)</span>  time a basis for the dual of each of these views — thereby proving Theorem 1.7.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Remark 2.1.</strong> For the sake of those familiar with BS-RS we remark that the domain D' is the carefully chosen subset of  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125; \times \mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span>  designated by that construction, the code  <span class="math">C^1</span>  is the code that evaluates bivariate polynomials of degree  <span class="math">O(\sqrt&#123;d&#125;)</span>  on  <span class="math">D \cup D'</span>  (along the way mapping  <span class="math">D \subseteq \mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span>  to a subset of  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125; \times \mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span> ), the subdomains  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j</span>  are the axis-parallel "rows" and "columns" used in that recursive construction, and the codes  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;C&#125;_j</span>  are Reed-Solomon codes of block length  <span class="math">O(\sqrt&#123;d&#125;)</span> . The  <span class="math">O(\sqrt&#123;d&#125;)</span> -locality and independence follow from basic properties of bivariate Reed-Muller codes; see Example 4.14.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 2.2. It is interesting to compare the above result with <em>linear lower bounds on query complexity</em> for testing proximity to random low density parity check (LDPC) codes [BHR05, BGK<sup>+</sup>10]. Those results are proved by obtaining a basis for the dual code such that every small-support constraint is spanned by a small subset of that basis. The same can be observed to hold for BS-RS, even though this latter code is locally testable with <em>polylogarithmic query complexity</em> [BS08, Thm. 2.13]. The difference between the two cases is due to the fact that, for a random LDPC code, an assignment that satisfies all but a single basis-constraint is (with high probability) far from the code, whereas the recursive and 1-intersecting structure of BS-RS implies the existence of words that satisfy all but a single basis constraint, yet are negligibly close to being a codeword.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">We provide intuition about the connection between constraint detection and zero knowledge (Section 2.2.1), and how we leverage this connection to achieve two intermediate results: (i) a sumcheck protocol that is zero knowledge in the Interactive PCP model (Section 2.2.2); and (ii) proximity proofs for Reed–Solomon codes that are zero knowledge in the Interactive Oracle Proof model (Section 2.2.3).</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">Suppose that the prover and verifier both have oracle access to a codeword  <span class="math">w \in C</span> , for some linear code  <span class="math">C \subseteq \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^D</span>  with exponential-size domain D, and that they need to engage in some protocol that involves w. During the protocol, the prover may leak information about w that is hard to compute (e.g., requires exponentially-many queries to w), and so would violate zero knowledge (as we see below, this is the case for protocols such as sumcheck).</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Rather than directly invoking the protocol, the prover first sends to the verifier a random codeword  <span class="math">r \in C</span>  (as an oracle since r has exponential size) and the verifier replies with a random field element  <span class="math">\rho \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span> ; then the prover and verifier invoke the protocol on the new codeword  <span class="math">w' := \rho w + r \in C</span>  rather than w. Intuitively, running the protocol on w' now does not leak information about w, because w' is random in C (up to resolvable technicalities). This <em>random self-reducibility</em> makes sense for only some protocols, e.g., those where completeness is preserved for any choice of  <span class="math">\rho</span>  and soundness is broken for only a small fraction of  <span class="math">\rho</span> ; but this will indeed be the case for the settings described below.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The aforementioned <em>masking</em> technique was used by [BCGV16] for codes with polynomial-size domains, but we use it for codes with exponential-size domains, which requires exponentially more efficient simulation techniques. Indeed, to prove (perfect) zero knowledge, a simulator must be able to reproduce, exactly, the view obtained by any malicious verifier that queries entries of w', a uniformly random codeword in C; however, it is too expensive for the simulator to explicitly sample a random codeword and answer the verifier's queries according to it. Instead, the simulator must sample the "local view" that the verifier sees while querying w' at a <em>small</em> number of locations  <span class="math">I \subseteq D</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">But simulating local views of the form  <span class="math">w'|_I</span>  is reducible to detecting <em>constraints</em>, i.e., codewords in the dual code  <span class="math">C^&#123;\perp&#125;</span>  whose support is contained in I. Indeed, if no word in  <span class="math">C^&#123;\perp&#125;</span>  has support contained in I then  <span class="math">w'|_I</span>  is uniformly random; otherwise, each additional linearly independent constraint of  <span class="math">C^&#123;\perp&#125;</span>  with support contained in I further reduces</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">the entropy of  <span class="math">w'|_I</span>  in a well-understood manner. (See Lemma 4.3 for a formal statement.) In sum, succinct constraint detection enables us to "implement" [GGN10, BW04] random codewords of C despite C having exponential size.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Note that in the above discussion we implicitly assumed that the set I is known in advance, i.e., that the verifier chooses its queries in advance. This, of course, need not be the case: a verifier may adaptively make queries based on answers to previous queries and, hence, the set I need not be known a priori. This turns out to not be a problem because, given a constraint detector, it is straightforward to compute the conditional distribution of the view  <span class="math">w'|_I</span>  given  <span class="math">w'|_J</span>  for a subset J of I. This is expressed precisely in Lemma 4.3.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We now discuss two concrete protocols for which the aforementioned random self-reducibility applies, and for which we also have constructed suitably-efficient constraint detectors.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">The celebrated sumcheck protocol [LFKN92] is not zero knowledge. In the sumcheck protocol, the prover and verifier have oracle access to a low-degree m-variate polynomial F over a field  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span> , and the prover wants to convince the verifier that  <span class="math">\sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in H^m&#125; F(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;) = 0</span>  for a given subset H of  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span> . During the protocol, the prover communicates partial sums of F, which are #P-hard to compute and, as such, violate zero knowledge.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We now explain how to use random self-reducibility to make the sumcheck protocol (perfect) zero knowledge, at the cost of moving from the Interactive Proof model to the Interactive PCP model.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>IPCP sumcheck.</strong> Consider the following tweak to the classical sumcheck protocol: rather than invoking sumcheck on F directly, the prover first sends to the verifier (the evaluation of) a random low-degree polynomial R as an oracle; then,</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">the prover sends the value  <span class="math">z:=\sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;\in H^m&#125;R(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)</span>  and the verifier replies with a random field element  <span class="math">\rho</span> ; finally, the two invoke sumcheck on the claim " <span class="math">\sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;\in H^m&#125;Q(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)=z</span> " where  <span class="math">Q:=\rho F+R</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Completeness is clear because if  <span class="math">\sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;\in H^m&#125;F(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)=0</span>  and  <span class="math">\sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;\in H^m&#125;R(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)=z</span>  then  <span class="math">\sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;\in H^m&#125;(\rho F+R)(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)=z</span> ; soundness is also clear because if  <span class="math">\sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;\in H^m&#125;F(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)\neq 0</span>  then  <span class="math">\sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;\in H^m&#125;(\rho F+R)(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)\neq z</span>  with high probability over  <span class="math">\rho</span> , we call the set of the choice of R. (Figure 1) in this interval in the standard transfer that the variety of the choice of R. regardless of the choice of R. (For simplicity, we ignore the fact that the verifier also needs to test that R has low degree.) We are thus left to show (perfect) zero knowledge, which turns out to be a much less straightforward argument.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>The simulator.</strong> Before we explain how to argue zero knowledge, we first clarify what we mean by it: since the verifier has oracle access to F we cannot hope to 'hide' it; nevertheless, we can hope to argue that the verifier, by participating in the protocol, does not learn anything about F beyond what the verifier can directly learn by querying F (and the fact that F sums to zero on  <span class="math">H^m</span> ). What we shall achieve is the following: an algorithm that simulates the verifier's view by making as many queries to F as the <em>total</em> number of verifier queries to either F or R.<sup>4</sup></p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">On the surface, zero knowledge seems easy to argue, because  <span class="math">\rho F + R</span>  seems random among low-degree m-variate polynomials. More precisely, consider the simulator that samples a random low-degree polynomial Q and uses it instead of  <span class="math">\rho F + R</span>  and answers the verifier queries as follows: (a) whenever the verifier queries  <span class="math">F(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)</span> , respond by querying  <span class="math">F(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)</span>  and returning the true value; (b) whenever the verifier queries  <span class="math">R(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)</span> , respond by querying  <span class="math">F(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)</span>  and returning  <span class="math">Q(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;) - \rho F(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)</span> . Observe that the number of queries to F made by the simulator equals the number of (mutually) distinct queries to F and R made by the verifier, as desired.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">However, the above reasoning, while compelling, is insufficient. First,  <span class="math">\rho F + R</span>  is not random because a malicious verifier can choose  <span class="math">\rho</span>  depending on queries to R. Second, even if  <span class="math">\rho F + R</span>  were random (e.g., the verifier does not query R before choosing  <span class="math">\rho</span> ), the simulator must run in polynomial time, both producing correctly-distributed 'partial sums' of  <span class="math">\rho F + R</span>  and answering queries to R, but sampling Q alone requires exponential time. In this high level discussion we ignore the first problem (which nonetheless has to be tackled), and focus on the second.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">At this point it should be clear from the discussion in Section 2.2.1 that the simulator does not have to sample Q explicitly, but only has to perfectly simulate local views of it by leveraging the fact that it can keep state across queries. And doing so requires solving the succinct constraint detection problem for a suitable code C. In this case, it suffices to consider the code  <span class="math">C = \Sigma RM</span> , and our Theorem 1.5 guarantees the required constraint detector.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The above discussion omits several details, so we refer the reader to Section 5 for further details.</p>
      <span id="page-9-1"></span><sup>&</sup>lt;sup&gt;4</sup>A subsequent work [CFS17] shows how to bootstrap this IPCP sumcheck protocol into a more complex one that has a stronger zero knowledge guarantee: the simulator can sample the verifier's view by making as many queries to F as the number of verifier queries (plus one). Nevertheless, the weaker zero knowledge guarantee that we achieve suffices for our purposes.

      <p class="text-gray-300">Testing proximity of a codeword w to a given linear code C can be aided by a <em>proximity proof</em> [\[DR04,](#page-57-13) [BGH](#page-56-15)+06], which is an auxiliary oracle π that facilitates testing (e.g., C is not locally testable). For example, testing proximity to the Reed–Solomon code, a crucial step towards achieving short PCPs, is aided via suitable proximity proofs [\[BS08\]](#page-57-0).</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">From the perspective of zero knowledge, however, a proximity proof can be 'dangerous': a few locations of π can in principle leak a lot of information about the codeword w, and a malicious verifier could potentially learn a lot about w with only a few queries to w and π. The notion of zero knowledge for proximity proofs requires that this cannot happen: it requires the existence of an algorithm that simulates the verifier's view by making as many queries to w as the <em>total</em> number of verifier queries to either w or π [\[IW14\]](#page-58-20); intuitively, this means that any bit of the proximity proof π reveals no more information than one bit of w.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We demonstrate again the use of random self-reducibility and show a general transformation that, under certain conditions, maps a PCP of proximity (P, V ) for a code C to a corresponding 2-round Interactive Oracle Proof of Proximity (IOPP) for C that is <em>(perfect) zero knowledge</em>.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">IOP of proximity for C. Consider the following IOP of Proximity: the prover and verifier have oracle access to a codeword w, and the prover wants to convince the verifier that w is close to C; the prover first sends to the verifier a random codeword r in C, and the verifier replies with a random field element ρ; the prover then sends the proximity proof π 0 := P(w 0 ) that attests that w 0 := ρw + r is close to C. Note that this is a 2-round IOP of Proximity for C, because completeness follows from the fact that C is linear, while soundness follows because if w is far from C, then so is ρw + r for every r with high probability over ρ. But is the zero knowledge property satisfied?</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The simulator. Without going into details, analogously to Section [2.2.2,](#page-9-0) a simulator must be able to sample local views for random codewords from the code L := &#123; wkP(w) &#125;w∈<sup>C</sup> , so the simulator's efficiency reduces to the efficiency of constraint detection for L. We indeed prove that if L has succinct constraint detection then the simulator works out. See Section [7.1](#page-34-1) for further details.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The case of Reed–Solomon. The above machinery allows us to derive a zero knowledge IOP of Proximity for Reed–Solomon codes, thanks to our Theorem [1.7,](#page-5-1) which states that the family of linear codes comprised of evaluations of low-degree univariate polynomials concatenated with corresponding BS proximity proofs [\[BS08\]](#page-57-0) has succinct constraint detection; see Section [7.2](#page-37-0) for details. This is one of the building blocks of our construction of zero knowledge IOPs for NEXP, as described below in Section [2.3.2.](#page-10-3)</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">We provide intuition for the proof of Theorem [1.2,](#page-3-1) which states that the complexity class #P has Interactive PCPs that are perfect zero knowledge.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We first recall the classical (non zero knowledge) Interactive Proof for #P [\[LFKN92\]](#page-58-1). The language L#3SAT, which consists of pairs (φ, N) where φ is a 3-CNF boolean formula and N is the number of satisfying assignments of φ, is #P-complete, and thus it suffices to construct an IP for it. The IP for L#3SAT works as follows: the prover and verifier both <em>arithmetize</em> φ to obtain a low-degree multivariate polynomial p<sup>φ</sup> and invoke the (non zero knowledge) sumcheck protocol on the claim "P ~α∈&#123;0,1&#125;<sup>n</sup> pφ(~α) = N", where arithmetic is over a large-enough prime field.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Returning to our goal, we obtain a perfect zero knowledge Interactive PCP by simply replacing the (non zero knowledge) IP sumcheck mentioned above with our perfect zero knowledge IPCP sumcheck, described in Section [2.2.2.](#page-9-0) In Section [6](#page-33-0) we provide further details, including proving that the zero knowledge guarantees of our sumcheck protocol suffice for this case.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">We provide intuition for the proof of Theorem [1.1,](#page-3-2) which implies that the complexity class NEXP has Interactive Oracle Proofs that are perfect zero knowledge. Very informally, the proof consists of combining two building blocks: (i) [BCGV16]'s reduction from <strong>NEXP</strong> to <em>randomizable</em> linear algebraic constraint satisfaction problems, and (ii) our construction of perfect zero knowledge IOPs of Proximity for Reed–Solomon codes, described in Section 2.2.3. Besides extending [BCGV16]'s result from <strong>NP</strong> to <strong>NEXP</strong>, our proof provides a conceptual simplification over [BCGV16] by clarifying how the above two building blocks work together towards the final result. We now discuss this.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Starting point:</strong> [BS08]. Many PCP constructions consist of two steps: (1) arithmetize the statement at hand (in our case, membership of an instance in some NEXP-complete language) by reducing it to a "PCP-friendly" problem that looks like a <em>linear-algebraic</em> constraint satisfaction problem (LACSP); (2) design a tester that probabilistically checks witnesses for this LACSP. In this paper, as in [BCGV16], we take [BS08]'s PCPs for NEXP as a starting point, where the first step reduces NEXP to a "univariate" LACSP whose witnesses are codewords in a Reed–Solomon code of exponential degree that satisfy certain properties, and whose second step relies on suitable <em>proximity proofs</em> [DR04, BGH+06] for that code. Thus, overall, the PCP consists of two oracles, one being the LACSP witness and the other being the corresponding BS proximity proof, and it is not hard to see that such a PCP is <em>not</em> zero knowledge, because both the LACSP witness and its proximity proof reveal hard-to-compute information.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Step 1: sanitize the proximity proof.</strong> We first address the problem that the BS proximity proof "leaks", by simply replacing it with our own perfect zero knowledge analogue. Namely, we replace it with our perfect zero knowledge 2-round IOP of Proximity for Reed–Solomon codes, described in Section 2.2.3. This modification ensures that there exists an algorithm that perfectly simulates the verifier's view by making as many queries to the LACSP witness as the <em>total</em> number of verifier queries to <em>either the LACSP witness or other oracles used to facilitate proximity testing</em>. At this point we have obtained a perfect zero knowledge 2-round IOP of Proximity for <strong>NEXP</strong> (analogous to the notion of a zero knowledge PCP of Proximity [IW14]); this part is where, previously, [BCGV16] were restricted to <strong>NP</strong> because their simulator only handled Reed–Solomon codes with <em>polynomial</em> degree while our simulator is efficient even for such codes with <em>exponential</em> degree. But we are not done yet: to obtain our goal, we also need to address the problem that the LACSP witness itself "leaks" when the verifier queries it, which we discuss next.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Step 2: sanitize the witness. Intuitively, we need to inject randomness in the reduction from NEXP to LACSP because the prover ultimately sends an LACSP witness to the verifier as an oracle, which the verifier can query. This is precisely what [BCGV16]'s reduction from NEXP to randomizable LACSPs enables, and we thus use their reduction to complete our proof. Informally, given an a-priori query bound b on the verifier's queries, the reduction outputs a witness w with the property that one can efficiently sample another witness w' whose entries are b-wise independent. We can then simply use the IOP of Proximity from the previous step on this randomized witness. Moreover, since the efficiency of the verifier is polylogarithmic in b, we can set b to be super-polynomial (e.g., exponential) to preserve zero knowledge against any polynomial number of verifier queries.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The above discussion is only a sketch and we refer the reader to Section 8 for further details. One aspect that we did not discuss is that an LACSP witness actually consists of two sub-witnesses, where one is a "local" deterministic function of the other, which makes arguing zero knowledge somewhat more delicate.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Functions, distributions, fields.</strong> We use  <span class="math">f: D \to R</span>  to denote a function with domain D and range R; given a subset  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;D&#125;</span>  of D, we use  <span class="math">f|_&#123;\tilde&#123;D&#125;&#125;</span>  to denote the restriction of f to  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;D&#125;</span> . Given a distribution  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;D&#125;</span> , we write  <span class="math">x \leftarrow \mathcal&#123;D&#125;</span>  to denote that x is sampled according to  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;D&#125;</span> . We denote by  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span>  a finite field and by  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_q</span>  the field of size q; we say  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span>  is a <em>binary field</em> if its characteristic is 2. Arithmetic operations over  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_q</span>  cost polylog q but we shall consider these to have unit cost (and inspection shows that accounting for their actual polylogarithmic cost does not change any of the stated results).</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Distances.</strong> A distance measure is a function  <span class="math">\Delta \colon \Sigma^n \times \Sigma^n \to [0,1]</span>  such that for all  <span class="math">x,y,z \in \Sigma^n</span> : (i)  <span class="math">\Delta(x,x) = 0</span> , (ii)  <span class="math">\Delta(x,y) = \Delta(y,x)</span> , and (iii)  <span class="math">\Delta(x,y) \leq \Delta(x,z) + \Delta(z,y)</span> . We extend  <span class="math">\Delta</span>  to distances to sets: given  <span class="math">x \in \Sigma^n</span>  and  <span class="math">S \subseteq \Sigma^n</span> , we define  <span class="math">\Delta(x,S) := \min_&#123;y \in S&#125; \Delta(x,y)</span>  (or 1 if S is empty). We say that a string x is  <span class="math">\epsilon</span> -close to another string y if  <span class="math">\Delta(x,y) \leq \epsilon</span> , and  <span class="math">\epsilon</span> -far from y if  <span class="math">\Delta(x,y) &gt; \epsilon</span> ; similar terminology applies for a string x and a set S. Unless noted otherwise, we use the <em>relative Hamming distance</em> over alphabet  <span class="math">\Sigma</span>  (typically implicit):  <span class="math">\Delta(x,y) := |\&#123;i : x_i \neq y_i\&#125;|/n</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Languages and relations.</strong> We denote by  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;R&#125;</span>  a (binary ordered) relation consisting of pairs (x, w), where x is the <em>instance</em> and w is the <em>witness</em>. We denote by  <span class="math">\mathrm&#123;Lan&#125;(\mathscr&#123;R&#125;)</span>  the language corresponding to  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;R&#125;</span> , and by  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;R&#125;|_x</span>  the set of witnesses in  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;R&#125;</span>  for x (if  <span class="math">x \notin \mathrm&#123;Lan&#125;(\mathscr&#123;R&#125;)</span>  then  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;R&#125;|_x := \emptyset</span> ). As always, we assume that |w| is bounded by some computable function of n := |x|; in fact, we are mainly interested in relations arising from nondeterministic languages:  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;R&#125; \in \mathbf&#123;NTIME&#125;(T)</span>  if there exists a T(n)-time machine M such that M(x, w) outputs 1 if and only if  <span class="math">(x, w) \in \mathscr&#123;R&#125;</span> . Throughout, we assume that  <span class="math">T(n) \geq n</span> . We say that  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;R&#125;</span>  has relative distance  <span class="math">\delta_&#123;\mathscr&#123;R&#125;&#125; \colon \mathbb&#123;N&#125; \to [0, 1]</span>  if  <span class="math">\delta_&#123;\mathscr&#123;R&#125;&#125;(n)</span>  is the minimum relative distance among witnesses in  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;R&#125;|_x</span>  for all x of size n. Throughout, we assume that  <span class="math">\delta_&#123;\mathscr&#123;R&#125;&#125;</span>  is a constant.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Polynomials.</strong> We denote by  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;[X_1,\ldots,X_m]</span>  the ring of polynomials in m variables over  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span> . Given a polynomial P in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;[X_1,\ldots,X_m]</span> ,  <span class="math">\deg_&#123;X_i&#125;(P)</span>  is the degree of P in the variable  <span class="math">X_i</span> . We denote by  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;&lt; d&#125;[X_1,\ldots,X_m]</span>  the subspace consisting of  <span class="math">P \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;[X_1,\ldots,X_m]</span>  with  <span class="math">\deg_&#123;X_i&#125;(P) &lt; d</span>  for every  <span class="math">i \in \&#123;1,\ldots,m\&#125;</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Random shifts. We later use a folklore claim about distance preservation for random shifts in linear spaces.</p>

If x is  $\epsilon$ -far from S, then  $\alpha x + y$  is  $\epsilon/2$ -far from S, with probability  $1 - |\mathbb&#123;F&#125;|^&#123;-1&#125;$  over a random  $\alpha \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;$ .

      <p class="text-gray-300">We use two types of proof systems that combine aspects of interactive proofs [Bab85, GMR89] and probabilistically checkable proofs [BFLS91, AS98, ALM<sup>+</sup>98]: <strong>interactive PCPs</strong> (IPCPs) [KR08] and <strong>interactive oracle proofs</strong> (IOPs) [BCS16, RRR16]. We first describe IPCPs (Section 3.2.1) and then IOPs (Section 3.2.2), which generalize the former.</p>
      <h4 id="span-id-page-12-3-span-3-2-1-interactive-probabilistically-checkable-proofs" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2"><span id="page-12-3"></span>3.2.1 Interactive probabilistically checkable proofs</h4>
      <p class="text-gray-300">An <strong>IPCP</strong> [KR08] is a PCP followed by an IP. Namely, the prover P and verifier V interact as follows: P sends to V a probabilistically checkable proof  <span class="math">\pi</span> ; afterwards, P and  <span class="math">V^&#123;\pi&#125;</span>  engage in an interactive proof. Thus, V may read a few bits of  <span class="math">\pi</span>  but must read subsequent messages from P in full. An <em>IPCP system</em> for a relation  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;R&#125;</span>  is thus a pair (P,V), where P,V are probabilistic interactive algorithms working as described, that satisfies naturally-defined notions of perfect completeness and soundness with a given error  <span class="math">\varepsilon(\cdot)</span> ; see [KR08] for details.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We say that an IPCP has k rounds if this "PCP round" is followed by a (k-1)-round interactive proof. (That is, we count the PCP round towards round complexity, unlike [KR08].) Beyond round complexity, we also measure how many bits the prover sends and how many the verifier reads: the <em>proof length</em> | is the length of  <span class="math">\pi</span>  in bits plus the number of bits in all subsequent prover messages; the <em>query complexity</em> q is the number of bits of  <span class="math">\pi</span>  read by the verifier plus the number of bits in all subsequent prover messages (since the verifier must read all of those bits).</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">In this work, we do not count the number of bits in the verifier messages, nor the number of random bits used by the verifier; both are bounded from above by the verifier's running time, which we do consider. Overall, we say that a relation  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;R&#125;</span>  belongs to the complexity class  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;IPCP&#125;[k, l, q, \varepsilon, tp, tv]</span>  if there is an IPCP system for  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;R&#125;</span>  in which: (1) the number of rounds is at most k(n); (2) the proof length is at most l(n); (3) the query complexity is at most q(n); (4) the soundness error is  <span class="math">\varepsilon(n)</span> ; (5) the prover algorithm runs in time tp(n); (6) the verifier algorithm runs in time tv(n).</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">An IOP [BCS16, RRR16] is a "multi-round PCP". That is, an IOP generalizes an interactive proof as follows: whenever the prover sends to the verifier a message, the verifier does not have to read the message in full but may probabilistically query it. In more detail, a k-round IOP comprises k rounds of interaction. In the <em>i</em>-th round of interaction: the verifier sends a message  <span class="math">m_i</span>  to the prover; then the prover replies with a message  <span class="math">\pi_i</span>  to the verifier, which the verifier can query in this and later rounds (via oracle queries). After the k rounds of interaction, the verifier either accepts or rejects.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">An <em>IOP system</em> for a relation  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;R&#125;</span>  with soundness error  <span class="math">\varepsilon</span>  is thus a pair (P, V), where P, V are probabilistic interactive algorithms working as described, that satisfies the following properties. (See [BCS16] for more details.)</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Completeness: For every instance-witness pair (x, w) in the relation  <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;R&#125;</span> ,  <span class="math">\Pr[\langle P(x, w), V(x) \rangle = 1] = 1</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Soundness: For every instance x not in  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;R&#125;</span> 's language and unbounded malicious prover  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;P&#125;</span> ,  <span class="math">\Pr[\langle \tilde&#123;P&#125;, V(x) \rangle = 1] \leq \varepsilon(n)</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Beyond round complexity, we also measure how many bits the prover sends and how many the verifier reads: the <em>proof length</em> I is the total number of bits in all of the prover's messages, and the <em>query complexity</em> q is the total number of bits read by the verifier across all of the prover's messages. Considering all of these parameters, we say that a relation  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;R&#125;</span>  belongs to the complexity class  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;IOP&#125;[k, l, q, \varepsilon, tp, tv]</span>  if there is an IOP system for  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;R&#125;</span>  in which: (1) the number of rounds is at most k(n); (2) the proof length is at most k(n); (3) the query complexity is at most k(n); (4) the soundness error is k(n); (5) the prover algorithm runs in time k(n); (6) the verifier algorithm runs in time k(n).</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>IOP vs. IPCP.</strong> An IPCP (see Section 3.2.1) is a special case of an IOP because an IPCP verifier must read in full all of the prover's messages except the first one (while an IOP verifier may query any part of any prover message). The above complexity measures are consistent with those defined for IPCPs.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">The definitions below are about IOPs, but IPCPs inherit all of these definitions because they are a special case of IOP. <strong>Adaptivity of queries.</strong> An IOP system is <em>non-adaptive</em> if the verifier queries are non-adaptive, i.e., the queried locations depend only on the verifier's inputs.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Public coins.</strong> An IOP system is <em>public coin</em> if each verifier message  <span class="math">m_i</span>  is chosen uniformly and independently at random, and all of the verifier queries happen after receiving the last prover message.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Proximity.</strong> An <em>IOP of proximity</em> extends the definition of an IOP in the same way that a PCP of proximity extends that of a PCP [DR04, BGH<sup>+</sup>06]. An <em>IOPP system</em> for a relation  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;R&#125;</span>  with soundness error  <span class="math">\varepsilon</span>  and proximity parameter  <span class="math">\delta</span>  is a pair (P, V) that satisfies the following properties.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">Similarly to above, a relation  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;R&#125;</span>  belongs to the complexity class  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;IOPP&#125;[\mathsf&#123;k&#125;,\mathsf&#123;l&#125;,\mathsf&#123;q&#125;,\varepsilon,\delta,\mathsf&#123;tp&#125;,\mathsf&#123;tv&#125;]</span>  if there is an IOPP system for  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;R&#125;</span>  with the corresponding parameters.

      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Promise relations.</strong> A promise relation is a relation-language pair  <span class="math">(\mathscr&#123;R&#125;^&#123;YES&#125;, \mathscr&#123;L&#125;^&#123;NO&#125;)</span>  with  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;Lan&#125;(\mathscr&#123;R&#125;^&#123;YES&#125;) \cap \mathscr&#123;L&#125;^&#123;NO&#125; = \emptyset</span> .

      <h4 id="3-2-4-prior-constructions" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3.2.4 Prior constructions</h4>
      <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper we give new IPCP and IOP constructions that achieve perfect zero knowledge for various settings. Below we summarize known constructions in these two models.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>IPCPs.</strong> Prior work obtains IPCPs with proof length that depends on the witness size rather than computation size [KR08, GKR08], and IPCPs with statistical zero knowledge [GIMS10] (see Section 3.3 for more details).</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>IOPs.</strong> Prior work obtains IOPs with perfect zero knowledge for <strong>NP</strong> [BCGV16], IOPs with small proof length and query complexity [BCG<sup>+</sup>17], and an amortization theorem for "unambiguous" IOPs [RRR16]. Also, [BCS16] show how to compile public-coin IOPs into non-interactive arguments in the random oracle model.</p>
      <h4 id="span-id-page-14-0-span-3-3-zero-knowledge" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2"><span id="page-14-0"></span>3.3 Zero knowledge</h4>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We define the notion of zero knowledge for IOPs and IPCPs achieved by our constructions: <em>unconditional (perfect) zero knowledge via straightline simulators</em>. This notion is quite strong not only because it unconditionally guarantees simulation of the verifier's view but also because straightline simulation implies desirable properties such as composability. We now provide some context and then give formal definitions.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">At a high level, zero knowledge requires that the verifier's view can be efficiently simulated without the prover. Converting the informal statement into a mathematical one involves many choices, including choosing which verifier class to consider (e.g., the honest verifier? all polynomial-time verifiers?), the quality of the simulation (e.g., is it identically distributed to the view? statistically close to it? computationally close to it?), the simulator's dependence on the verifier (e.g., is it non-uniform? or is the simulator universal?), and others. The definitions below consider two variants: perfect simulation via universal simulators against either unbounded-query or bounded-query verifiers.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Moreover, in the case of universal simulators, one distinguishes between a non-blackbox use of the verifier, which means that the simulator takes the verifier's code as input, and a blackbox use of it, which means that the simulator only accesses the verifier via a restricted interface; we consider this latter case. Different models of proof systems call for different interfaces, which grant carefully-chosen "extra powers" to the simulator (in comparison to the prover) so to ensure that efficiency of the simulation does not imply the ability to efficiently decide the language. For example: in ZK IPs, the simulator may rewind the verifier; in ZK PCPs, the simulator may adaptively answer oracle queries. In ZK IPCPs and ZK IOPs (our setting), the natural definition would allow a blackbox simulator to rewind the verifier <em>and also</em> to adaptively answer oracle queries. The definitions below, however, consider only simulators that are straightline [FS89, DS98], that is they do not rewind the verifier, because our constructions achieve this stronger notion.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We are now ready to define the notion of unconditional (perfect) zero knowledge via straightline simulators. We first discuss the notion for IOPs, then for IOPs of proximity, and finally for IPCPs.</p>
      <h4 id="span-id-page-14-2-span-3-3-1-zk-for-iops" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2"><span id="page-14-2"></span>3.3.1 ZK for IOPs</h4>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We define zero knowledge (via straightline simulators) for IOPs. We begin by defining the view of an IOP verifier.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 3.2.</strong> Let A, B be algorithms and x, y strings. We denote by View  <span class="math">\langle B(y), A(x) \rangle</span>  the <strong>view</strong> of A(x) in an interactive oracle protocol with B(y), i.e., the random variable  <span class="math">(x, r, a_1, \ldots, a_n)</span>  where x is A's input, r is A's randomness, and  <span class="math">a_1, \ldots, a_n</span>  are the answers to A's queries into B's messages.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Straightline simulators in the context of IPs were used in [FS89], and later defined in [DS98]. The definition below considers this notion in the context of IOPs, where the simulator also has to answer oracle queries by the verifier. Note that since we consider the notion of unconditional (perfect) zero knowledge, the definition of straightline simulation needs to allow the efficient simulator to work even with inefficient verifiers [GIMS10].</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 3.3.</strong> We say that an algorithm B has <strong>straightline access</strong> to another algorithm A if B interacts with A, without rewinding, by exchanging messages with A and also answering any oracle queries along the way. We denote by  <span class="math">B^A</span>  the concatenation of A's random tape and B's output. (Since A's random tape could be super-polynomially large, B cannot sample it for A and then output it; instead, we restrict B to not see it, and we prepend it to B's output.)</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Recall that an algorithm A is b-query if, on input x, it makes at most b(|x|) queries to any oracles it has access to. We are now ready to define zero knowledge IOPs.</p>
      <span id="page-14-1"></span>**Definition 3.4.** An IOP system (P,V) for a relation  $\mathscr&#123;R&#125;$  is perfect zero knowledge (via straightline simulators) against unbounded queries (resp., against query bound b) if there exists a simulator algorithm S such that for every algorithm (resp., b-query algorithm)  $\tilde&#123;V&#125;$  and instance-witness pair  $(x, w) \in \mathscr&#123;R&#125;$ ,  $S^&#123;\tilde&#123;V&#125;&#125;(x)$  and View  $\langle P(x, w), \tilde&#123;V&#125;(x) \rangle$  are identically distributed. Moreover, S must run in time  $poly(|x| + q_&#123;\tilde&#123;V&#125;&#125;(|x|))$ , where  $q_&#123;\tilde&#123;V&#125;&#125;(\cdot)$  is  $\tilde&#123;V&#125;$ 's query complexity.
      <p class="text-gray-300">For zero knowledge against arbitrary polynomial-time adversaries, it suffices for b to be superpolynomial. Note that S's running time need not be polynomial in b (in our constructions it is polylogarithmic in b); rather its running time may be polynomial in the input size  <span class="math">|\mathbf&#123;x&#125;|</span>  and the <em>actual</em> number of queries  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;V&#125;</span>  makes (as a random variable).</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We say that a relation  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;R&#125;</span>  belongs to the complexity class <strong>PZK-IOP</strong>[k, l, q,  <span class="math">\varepsilon</span> , tp, tv, b] if there is an IOP system for  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;R&#125;</span> , with the corresponding parameters, that is perfect zero knowledge with query bound b; also, it belongs to the complexity class <strong>PZK-IOP</strong>[k, l, q,  <span class="math">\varepsilon</span> , tp, tv, \*] if the same is true with unbounded queries.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">We define zero knowledge (via straightline simulators) for IOPs of proximity. It is a straightforward extension of the corresponding notion for PCPs of proximity, introduced in [IW14].</p>
      <span id="page-15-1"></span>**Definition 3.5.** An IOPP system (P, V) for a relation  $\mathcal&#123;R&#125;$  is perfect zero knowledge (via straightline simulators) against unbounded queries (resp., against query bound b) if there exists a simulator algorithm S such that for every algorithm (resp., b-query algorithm)  $\tilde&#123;V&#125;$  and instance-witness pair  $(x, w) \in \mathcal&#123;R&#125;$ , the following two random variables are identically distributed:

      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Remark 3.6.</strong> Analogously to [IW14], our definition of zero knowledge for IOPs of proximity requires that the number of queries to w by S equals the total number of queries (to w or prover messages) by  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;V&#125;</span> . Stronger notions are possible: "the number of queries to w by  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;V&#125;</span> "; or, even more, "S and  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;V&#125;</span>  read the same locations of w".

      <p class="text-gray-300">We introduce the notion of <em>succinct constraint detection</em> for linear codes. This notion plays a crucial role in constructing perfect zero knowledge simulators for super-polynomial complexity classes (such as  <span class="math">\#\mathbf&#123;P&#125;</span>  and  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;NEXP&#125;</span> ), but we believe that this naturally-defined notion is also of independent interest. Given a linear code  <span class="math">C \subseteq \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^D</span>  we refer to its dual code  <span class="math">C^&#123;\perp&#125; \subseteq \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^D</span>  as the <em>constraint space</em> of C. The <em>constraint detection problem</em> corresponding to a family of linear codes  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;C&#125; = \&#123;C_n\&#125;_n</span>  with domain  <span class="math">D(\cdot)</span>  and alphabet  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;(\cdot)</span>  is the following:</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Given an index</p>
      <div class="math-block">n</div>
      <p class="text-gray-300">and subset  <span class="math">I \subseteq D(n)</span> , output a basis for  <span class="math">\&#123;z \in D(n)^I : \forall w \in C_n, \sum_&#123;i \in I&#125; z(i)w(i) = 0\&#125;</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">If  <span class="math">|D(\mathfrak&#123;m&#125;)|</span>  is polynomial in  <span class="math">|\mathfrak&#123;m&#125;|</span>  and a generating matrix for  <span class="math">C_\mathfrak&#123;m&#125;</span>  can be found in polynomial time, this problem can be solved in  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;poly&#125;(|\mathfrak&#123;m&#125;|+|I|)</span>  time via Gaussian elimination; such an approach was implicitly taken by [BCGV16] to construct a perfect zero knowledge simulator for an IOP for NP. However, in our setting,  <span class="math">|D(\mathfrak&#123;m&#125;)|</span>  is <em>exponential</em> in  <span class="math">|\mathfrak&#123;m&#125;|</span>  and |I|, and the aforementioned generic solution requires exponential time. With this in mind, we say  <span class="math">\mathscr C</span>  has <em>succinct constraint detection</em> if there exists an algorithm that solves the constraint detection problem in  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;poly&#125;(|\mathfrak&#123;m&#125;|+|I|)</span>  time when  <span class="math">|D(\mathfrak&#123;m&#125;)|</span>  is <em>exponential</em> in  <span class="math">|\mathfrak&#123;m&#125;|</span> . After defining succinct constraint detection in Section 4.1, we proceed as follows.</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-1 my-2">
        <li>In Section 4.2, we construct a succinct constraint detector for the family of linear codes comprised of evaluations of partial sums of low-degree polynomials. The construction of the detector exploits derandomization techniques from algebraic complexity theory. Later on (in Section 5), we leverage this result to construct a perfect zero knowledge simulator for an IPCP for #P.</li>
        <li>In Section 4.3, we construct a succinct constraint detector for the family of evaluations of univariate polynomials concatenated with corresponding BS proximity proofs [BS08]. The construction of the detector exploits the recursive structure of these proximity proofs. Later on (in Section 8), we leverage this result to construct a perfect zero knowledge simulator for an IOP for NEXP; this simulator can be interpreted as an analogue of [BCGV16]'s simulator that runs exponentially faster and thus enables us to "scale up" from NP to NEXP.</li>

      <p class="text-gray-300">Throughout this section we assume familiarity with terminology and notation about codes, introduced in Section 3.4.

In this section we make statements about vectors v in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;^D</span>  where the cardinality of the domain D may be super-polynomial. When such statements are computational in nature, we assume that v is not represented as a list of |D| field elements (which requires  <span class="math">\Omega(|D|\log|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;|)</span>  bits) but, instead, assume that v is represented as a list of the elements in  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;supp&#125;(v)</span>  (and each element comes with its index in D); this <em>sparse</em> representation only requires  <span class="math">\Omega(|\sup(v)| \cdot (\log|D| + \log|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;|))</span>  bits.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">A constraint detector induces a corresponding probabilistic algorithm for 'simulating' answers to queries to a random codeword; this is captured by the following lemma, the proof of which is in Appendix B.

      <p class="text-gray-300">For the purposes of <em>constructing</em> a constraint detector, the sufficient condition given in Lemma 4.6 below is sometimes easier to work with.

In particular, codewords in  <span class="math">C_&#123;\subseteq I&#125;</span>  are defined over D, while codewords in  <span class="math">C|_I</span>  are defined over I. Nevertheless, throughout this section, we sometimes compare vectors defined over different domains, with the implicit understanding that the comparison is conducted over the union of the relevant domains, by filling in zeros in the vectors' undefined coordinates. For example, we may write  <span class="math">C_&#123;\subseteq I&#125; \subseteq C|_I</span>  to mean that  <span class="math">\&#123;00\&#125; \subseteq \&#123;00,10\&#125;</span>  (the set obtained from  <span class="math">\&#123;0,1\&#125;</span>  after filling in the relevant zeros).</p>

      <span id="page-18-2"></span>**Remark 4.7.** The following operations do *not* commute: (i) expanding the domain via zero padding (for the purpose of comparing vectors over different domains), and (ii) taking the dual of the code. Consider for example the code  $C = \&#123;0\&#125; \subseteq \mathbb&#123;F&#125;_2^&#123;\&#123;1\&#125;&#125;$ : its dual code is  $C^&#123;\perp&#125; = \&#123;0,1\&#125;$  and, when expanded to  $\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_2^&#123;\&#123;1,2\&#125;&#125;$ , the dual code is expanded to  $\&#123;(0,0),(1,0)\&#125;$ ; yet, when C is expanded to  $\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_2^&#123;\&#123;1,2\&#125;&#125;$  it produces the code  $\&#123;(0,0)\&#125;$  and its dual code is  $\&#123;(0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1)\&#125;$ . To resolve ambiguities (when asserting an equality as in Claim 4.5), we adopt the convention that expansion is done *always last* (namely, as late as possible without having to compare vectors over different domains).

      <p class="text-gray-300">We show that evaluations of partial sums of low-degree polynomials have succinct constraint detection (see Definition 4.2). In the following,  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span>  is a finite field, m,d are positive integers, and H is a subset of  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span> ; also,  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;&lt; d&#125;[X_1,\ldots,X_m]</span>  denotes the subspace of  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;[X_1,\ldots,X_m]</span>  consisting of those polynomials with individual degrees less than d. Moreover, given  <span class="math">Q \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;&lt; d&#125;[X_1,\ldots,X_m]</span>  and  <span class="math">\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;\le m&#125;</span>  (vectors over  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span>  of length at most m), we define  <span class="math">Q(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;) := \sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\gamma&#125; \in H^&#123;m-|\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;|&#125;&#125; Q(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;,\vec&#123;\gamma&#125;)</span> , i.e., the answer to a query that specifies only a suffix of the variables is the sum of the values obtained by letting the remaining variables range over H. We begin by defining the code that we study, which extends the Reed-Muller code (see Section 3.4) with partial sums.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 4.8.</strong> We denote by  <span class="math">\Sigma \mathrm&#123;RM&#125;[\mathbb&#123;F&#125;, m, d, H]</span>  the linear code that comprises evaluations of partial sums of polynomials in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;&lt; d&#125;[X_1, \dots, X_m]</span> ; more precisely,  <span class="math">\Sigma \mathrm&#123;RM&#125;[\mathbb&#123;F&#125;, m, d, H] := \&#123;w_Q\&#125;_&#123;Q \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;&lt; d&#125;[X_1, \dots, X_m]&#125;</span>  where  <span class="math">w_Q \colon \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;\le m&#125; \to \mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span>  is the function defined by  <span class="math">w_Q(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;) := \sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\gamma&#125; \in H^&#123;m-|\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;|&#125;&#125; Q(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;, \vec&#123;\gamma&#125;)</span>  for each  <span class="math">\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;\le m&#125;</span> .

(We represent indices  <span class="math">\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;</span>  so to ensure that  <span class="math">|\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;| = \Theta(\log |\mathbb&#123;F&#125;| + m + d + |H|)</span> .)</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We prove that the linear code family  <span class="math">\Sigma RM</span>  has succinct constraint detection:</p>
      <span id="page-19-1"></span>**Theorem 4.9** (formal statement of 1.5).  $\Sigma RM$  has poly( $\log |\mathbb&#123;F&#125;| + m + d + |H| + \ell$ )-time constraint detection.
      <p class="text-gray-300">Combined with Lemma 4.3, the theorem above implies that there exists a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm for answering queries to a codeword sampled at random from  <span class="math">\Sigma RM</span> , as captured by the following corollary.</p>
      <span id="page-19-3"></span>**Corollary 4.10.** There exists a probabilistic algorithm  $\mathcal&#123;A&#125;$  such that, for every finite field  $\mathbb&#123;F&#125;$ , positive integers m, d, subset H of  $\mathbb&#123;F&#125;$ , subset  $S = \&#123;(\alpha_1, \beta_1), \ldots, (\alpha_\ell, \beta_\ell)\&#125; \subseteq \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;\leq m&#125; \times \mathbb&#123;F&#125;$ , and  $(\alpha, \beta) \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;\leq m&#125; \times \mathbb&#123;F&#125;$ ,
      <div class="math-block">\Pr\left[\mathcal&#123;A&#125;(\mathbb&#123;F&#125;, m, d, H, S, \alpha) = \beta\right] = \Pr_&#123;R \leftarrow \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;&lt; d&#125;[X_1, \dots, X_m]&#125; \left[ R(\alpha) = \beta \middle| \begin&#123;array&#125;&#123;c&#125; R(\alpha_1) = \beta_1 \\ \vdots \\ R(\alpha_\ell) = \beta_\ell \end&#123;array&#125; \right] .</div>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Moreover A runs in time</em> poly(log  <span class="math">|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;| + m + d + |H| + \ell</span> ).</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We sketch the proof of Theorem 4.9, for the simpler case where the code is  <span class="math">\mathrm&#123;RM&#125;[\mathbb&#123;F&#125;,m,d,H]</span>  (i.e., without partial sums). We can view a polynomial  <span class="math">Q \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;&lt; d&#125;[X_1,\ldots,X_m]</span>  as a vector over the monomial basis, with an entry for each possible monomial  <span class="math">X_1^&#123;i_1&#125;\ldots X_m^&#123;i_m&#125;</span>  (with  <span class="math">0\leq i_1,\ldots,i_m&lt; d</span> ) containing the corresponding coefficient. The evaluation of Q at a point  <span class="math">\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;\in\mathbb&#123;F&#125;^m</span>  then equals the inner product of this vector with the vector  <span class="math">\phi_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;&#125;</span> , in the same basis, whose entry for  <span class="math">X_1^&#123;i_1&#125;\ldots X_m^&#123;i_m&#125;</span>  is equal to  <span class="math">\alpha_1^&#123;i_1&#125;\ldots \alpha_m^&#123;i_m&#125;</span> . Given  <span class="math">\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;_1,\ldots,\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;_\ell</span> , we could use Gaussian elimination on  <span class="math">\phi_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;_1&#125;,\ldots,\phi_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;_\ell&#125;</span>  to check for linear dependencies, which would be equivalent to constraint detection for  <span class="math">\mathrm&#123;RM&#125;[\mathbb&#123;F&#125;,m,d,H]</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">However, we cannot afford to explicitly write down  <span class="math">\phi_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;&#125;</span> , because it has  <span class="math">d^m</span>  entries. Nevertheless, we can still implicitly check for linear dependencies, and we do so by reducing the problem, by building on and extending ideas of [BW04], to computing the nullspace of a certain set of polynomials, which can be solved via an algorithm of [RS05] (see also [Kay10]). The idea is to encode the entries of these vectors via a succinct description: a polynomial  <span class="math">\Phi_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;&#125;</span>  whose coefficients (after expansion) are the entries of  <span class="math">\phi_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;&#125;</span> . In our setting this polynomial has the particularly natural form:</p>
      <div class="math-block">\Phi_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;&#125;(\vec&#123;X&#125;) := \prod_&#123;i=1&#125;^&#123;m&#125; (1 + \alpha_i X_i + \alpha_i^2 X_i^2 + \dots + \alpha_i^&#123;d-1&#125; X_i^&#123;d-1&#125;) ;</div>
      <p class="text-gray-300">note that the coefficient of each monomial equals its corresponding entry in  <span class="math">\phi_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;&#125;</span> . Given this representation we can use standard polynomial identity testing techniques to find linear dependencies between these polynomials, which corresponds to linear dependencies between the original vectors. Crucially, we cannot afford any mistake, even with exponentially small probability, when looking for linear dependencies for otherwise we would not achieve perfect simulation; this is why the techniques we leverage rely on derandomization. We now proceed with the full proof.</p>

We deduce that constraint detection for  <span class="math">\Sigma \text&#123;RM&#125;[\mathbb&#123;F&#125;, m, d, H]</span>  is equivalent to the problem of finding  <span class="math">a_1, \ldots, a_\ell \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span>  such that  <span class="math">\phi_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;&#125; = \sum_&#123;i=1&#125;^\ell a_i \phi_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;_i&#125;</span> , or returning 'independent' if no such  <span class="math">a_1, \ldots, a_\ell</span>  exist.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">However, the dimension of the latter vectors is  <span class="math">d^m</span> , which may be much larger than  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;poly&#125;(\log |\mathbb&#123;F&#125;| + m + d + |H| + \ell)</span> , and so we cannot afford to "explicitly" solve the  <span class="math">\ell \times d^m</span>  linear system. Instead, we "succinctly" solve it, by taking advantage of the special structure of the vectors, as we now describe.

      <p class="text-gray-300">Note that, while the above polynomial is computable via a small arithmetic circuit, its coefficients (once expanded over the monomial basis) correspond to the entries of the vector  <span class="math">\phi_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;&#125;</span> . More generally, for  <span class="math">\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;\leq m&#125;</span> , we define the polynomial</p>

We leverage this special structure and solve the above problem by relying on an algorithm of [RS05] that computes the nullspace for such polynomials (see also [Kay10]), as captured by the lemma below; for completeness, we provide an elementary proof of the lemma in Appendix D.</p>
      <span id="page-20-0"></span>One could use polynomial identity testing to solve the above problem in probabilistic polynomial time; see [Kay10, Lemma 8].

      <p class="text-gray-300">We show that evaluations of univariate polynomials concatenated with corresponding BS proximity proofs [BS08] have succinct constraint detection (see Definition 4.2). Recall that the Reed–Solomon code (see Section 3.4) is not locally testable, but one can test proximity to it with the aid of the quasilinear-size proximity proofs of Ben-Sasson and Sudan [BS08]. These latter apply when low-degree univariate polynomials are evaluated over <em>linear spaces</em>, so from now on we restrict our attention to Reed–Solomon codes of this form. More precisely, we consider Reed–Solomon codes  <span class="math">RS[\mathbb&#123;F&#125;, L, d]</span>  where  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span>  is an extension field of a base field  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;K&#125;</span> , L is a  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;K&#125;</span> -linear subspace in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span> , and  <span class="math">d = |L| \cdot |\mathbb&#123;K&#125;|^&#123;-\mu&#125;</span>  for some  <span class="math">\mu \in \mathbb&#123;N&#125;^+</span> . We then denote by  <span class="math">BS-RS[\mathbb&#123;K&#125;, \mathbb&#123;F&#125;, L, \mu, k]</span>  the code obtained by concatenating codewords in  <span class="math">RS[\mathbb&#123;F&#125;, L, |L| \cdot |\mathbb&#123;K&#125;|^&#123;-\mu&#125;]</span>  with corresponding BS proximity proofs whose recursion terminates at "base dimension"  <span class="math">k \in \&#123;1, \ldots, \dim(L)\&#125;</span>  (for completeness we include a formal definition of these in Appendix F); typically  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;K&#125;</span> ,  <span class="math">\mu</span> , k are fixed to certain constants (e.g., [BS08] fixes them to  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_2</span> , 3, 1, respectively) but below we state the cost of constraint detection in full generality. The linear code family BS-RS is indexed by tuples  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;n&#125; = (\mathbb&#123;K&#125;, \mathbb&#123;F&#125;, L, \mu, k)</span>  and the  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;n&#125;</span> -th code is  <span class="math">BS-RS[\mathbb&#123;K&#125;, \mathbb&#123;F&#125;, L, \mu, k]</span> , and our result about BS-RS is the following:</p>
      <span id="page-21-2"></span>**Theorem 4.12** (formal statement of 1.7). BS-RS has poly( $\log |\mathbb&#123;F&#125;| + \dim(L) + |\mathbb&#123;K&#125;|^&#123;\mu&#125; + \ell$ )-time constraint detection.
      <p class="text-gray-300">The proof of the above theorem is technically involved, and we present it via several steps, as follows. (1) In Section 4.3.1 we introduce the notion of a <em>code cover</em> and two key combinatorial properties of these:  <span class="math">\kappa</span> -locality and  <span class="math">\kappa</span> -independence. (2) In Section 4.3.2 we introduce the notion of a <em>recursive</em> code cover and relate its combinatorial properties to those of (standard) code covers. (3) In Section 4.3.3 we show how to construct succinct constraint detectors starting from algorithms that detect constraints only 'locally' for code covers and recursive code covers. (4) In Section 4.3.4 we show that BS-RS has a recursive code cover with the requisite properties and thus implies, via the results of prior steps, a succinct constraint detector, as claimed. Several sub-proofs are deferred to the appendices, and we provide pointers to these along the way.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The role of code covers. We are interested in succinct constraint detection: solving the constraint detection problem for certain code families with exponentially-large domains (such as BS-RS). We now build some intuition about how code covers can, in some cases, facilitate this.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Consider the simple case where the code  <span class="math">C \subseteq \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^D</span>  is a direct sum of many small codes: there exists  <span class="math">S = \&#123;(\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j, \tilde&#123;C&#125;_j)\&#125;_j</span>  such that  <span class="math">D = \bigcup_j \tilde&#123;D&#125;_j</span>  and  <span class="math">C = \bigoplus_j \tilde&#123;C&#125;_j</span>  where, for each  <span class="math">j, \tilde&#123;C&#125;_j</span>  is a linear code in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j&#125;</span>  and the subdomain  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j</span>  is small and disjoint from other subdomains. The detection problem for this case can be solved efficiently: use the generic approach of Gaussian elimination independently on each subdomain  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Next consider a more general case where the subdomains are not necessarily disjoint: there exists  <span class="math">S = \&#123;(\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j, \tilde&#123;C&#125;_j)\&#125;_j</span>  as above but we do not require that the  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j</span>  form a partition of D; we say that each  <span class="math">(\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j, \tilde&#123;C&#125;_j)</span>  is a local view of C because  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j \subseteq D</span>  and  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;C&#125;_j = C|_&#123;\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j&#125;</span> , and we say that S is a code cover of C. Now suppose that for each j there exists an efficient constraint detector for  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;C&#125;_j</span>  (which is defined on  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j</span> ); in this case, the detection problem can be solved efficiently at least for those subsets I that are contained in  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j</span>  for some j. Generalizing further, we see that we can efficiently solve constraint detection for a code C if there is a cover  <span class="math">S = \&#123;(\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j, \tilde&#123;C&#125;_j)\&#125;_j</span>  such that, given a subset  <span class="math">I \subseteq D</span> , (i) I is contained in some subdomain  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j</span> , and (ii) constraint detection for  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;C&#125;_j</span>  can be solved efficiently.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We build on the above ideas to derive analogous statements for recursive code covers, which arise naturally in the case of BS-RS. But note that recursive constructions are common in the PCP literature, and we believe that our cover-based techniques are of independent interest as, e.g., they are applicable to <em>other</em> PCPs, including [BFLS91, AS98].</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">The purpose of this section is to formally define the notion of cover and certain combinatorial properties of these.</p>
      <span id="page-22-5"></span>**Definition 4.13.** Let C be a linear code with domain D and alphabet  $\mathbb&#123;F&#125;$ . A (local) view of C is a pair  $(\tilde&#123;D&#125;, \tilde&#123;C&#125;)$  such that  $\tilde&#123;D&#125; \subseteq D$  and  $C|_&#123;\tilde&#123;D&#125;&#125; = \tilde&#123;C&#125;$ . A cover of C is a set of local views  $S = \&#123;(\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j, \tilde&#123;C&#125;_j)\&#125;_j$  of C such that  $D = \cup_j \tilde&#123;D&#125;_j$ . Also, we define a cover's domain intersection as  $di(S) := \cup_&#123;i \neq j&#125; (\tilde&#123;D&#125;_i \cap \tilde&#123;D&#125;_j)$  and, given a set J, we define  $\tilde&#123;D&#125;_J := \cup_&#123;i \in J&#125; \tilde&#123;D&#125;_i$ .
      <span id="page-22-0"></span>**Example 4.14** (line cover of RM). Suppose for instance that C is the Reed-Muller code  $\mathrm&#123;RM&#125;[\mathbb&#123;F&#125;,\mathbb&#123;F&#125;,m,d]\colon C$  consists of evaluations over  $D=\mathbb&#123;F&#125;^m$  of polynomials in  $\mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;&lt; d&#125;[X_1,\ldots,X_m]$  (see Definition 3.4). A cover of C that is extensively studied in the PCP and property-testing literature is the one given by (axis-parallel) *lines*. A line (in the i-th direction) is a set of  $|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;|$  points that agree on all but one coordinate (the i-th one); and the *line cover* of C is thus  $S=\&#123;(\tilde&#123;D&#125;_\ell,\tilde&#123;C&#125;_\ell)\&#125;$  where  $\ell$  ranges over all (axis-parallel) lines and  $\tilde&#123;C&#125;_\ell$  is the Reed-Solomon code  $\mathrm&#123;RS&#125;[\mathbb&#123;F&#125;,\mathbb&#123;F&#125;,d]$  (see Definition 3.4).
      <p class="text-gray-300">Observe that the domain intersection of the line cover equals  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;^m</span> , which is also the domain D of the base code C. However, for BS-RS, we consider a cover whose domain intersection is a strict subset of D (see Appendix G).</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Next, we specify a notion of <em>locality</em> for covers. A partial assignment  <span class="math">w' \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;D'&#125;</span>  is <em>locally consistent</em> with a cover  <span class="math">S = \&#123;(\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j, \tilde&#123;C&#125;_j)\&#125;_j</span>  if for every local view  <span class="math">(\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j, \tilde&#123;C&#125;_j)</span>  with  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j \subseteq D'</span>  the restriction  <span class="math">w'|_&#123;\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j&#125;</span>  is a codeword of  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;C&#125;_j</span> . Then we say that a cover is  <span class="math">\kappa</span> -local if any locally consistent assignment  <span class="math">w' \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;D'&#125;</span> , where D' is a union of at most  <span class="math">\kappa</span>  domains in the cover, can be extended to a "globally consistent" codeword w of C.</p>
      <span id="page-22-4"></span>**Definition 4.15.** Let C be a linear code with domain D and alphabet  $\mathbb&#123;F&#125;$ . Given  $\kappa \in \mathbb&#123;N&#125;$ , a  $\kappa$ -local cover of C is a cover  $S = \&#123;(\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j, \tilde&#123;C&#125;_j)\&#125;_j$  of C such that: for every subset of view-indices J of size at most  $\kappa$  and every word  $w' \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;\tilde&#123;D&#125;_J&#125;$  with  $w'|_&#123;\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j&#125; \in \tilde&#123;C&#125;_j$  (for every  $j \in J$ ), the word w' can be extended to some word w in C, i.e., w satisfies  $w|_&#123;\tilde&#123;D&#125;_J&#125; = w'$ ). (The trivial cover  $S = \&#123;(D, C)\&#125;$  of C is  $\kappa$ -local for every  $\kappa$ .)
      <p class="text-gray-300">The following definition significantly strengthens the previous one. Informally, a cover is  <span class="math">\kappa</span> -independent if every partial assignment over a subdomain D' that is the union of  <span class="math">\kappa</span>  subdomains from the cover and  <span class="math">\kappa</span>  auxiliary locations can be extended to a "globally consistent" codeword. We use this stronger notion in our main Lemma 4.20.</p>
      <span id="page-22-3"></span>**Definition 4.16.** Let C be a linear code with domain D and alphabet  $\mathbb&#123;F&#125;$ . Given  $\kappa \in \mathbb&#123;N&#125;$ , a  $\kappa$ -independent cover of C is a  $\kappa$ -local cover  $S = \&#123;(\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j, \tilde&#123;C&#125;_j)\&#125;_j$  such that for every set J of size at most  $\kappa$ , subdomain  $D' \subseteq \operatorname&#123;di&#125;(S)$  of size at most  $\kappa$ , and  $w' \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;D' \cup \tilde&#123;D&#125;_J&#125;$  with  $w'|_&#123;\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j&#125; \in \tilde&#123;C&#125;_j$  for every  $j \in J$ , there exists  $w \in C$  such that  $w|_&#123;D' \cup \tilde&#123;D&#125;_J&#125; = w'$ . (The trivial cover  $S = \&#123;(D, C)\&#125;$  of C is  $\kappa$ -independent for every  $\kappa \in \mathbb&#123;N&#125;$  because it is  $\kappa$ -local and has  $\operatorname&#123;di&#125;(S) = \emptyset$ .)
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Example 4.17.</strong> The line cover from Example 4.14 is d-local because any evaluation on at most d (axis-parallel) lines  <span class="math">\ell_1, \ldots, \ell_d</span>  that is a polynomial of degree (d-1) along each of  <span class="math">\ell_1, \ldots, \ell_d</span>  can be extended to a codeword of  <span class="math">\mathrm&#123;RM&#125;[\mathbb&#123;F&#125;, \mathbb&#123;F&#125;, m, d]</span> . Furthermore, it is d/2-independent because any locally consistent assignment to d/2 such lines and d/2 points  <span class="math">p_1, \ldots, p_&#123;d/2&#125;</span>  can be extended to a valid Reed–Muller codeword. To see this, observe that there exists an interpolating set  <span class="math">H_1 \times \cdots \times H_m</span>  (with  <span class="math">|H_i| = d</span> ) that contains  <span class="math">p_1, \ldots, p_&#123;d/2&#125;</span>  and intersects each line in d points; we shall later use this observation for the bivariate case (m=2), a proof for that case is provided at Claim H.1.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">Proximity proofs for codes such as the Reed–Solomon code and the Reed–Muller code are typically obtained via techniques of proof composition [AS98]. Informally, a problem is reduced to a set of smaller sub-problems of the same kind (which are usually interconnected), and a sub-proof is constructed for each sub-problem. This process leads to a proof for the original problem that is "covered" by the sub-proofs for the sub-problems, and naturally imply a cover of the proof by these sub-proofs. This process is then repeated recursively until the sub-problems are small enough for the verifier to check directly — and in our case leads to the notion of <em>recursive covers</em>, which we define below.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">To support the definition of a recursive cover, we first introduce notation for rooted trees. Edges in a rooted tree T = (V, E) are directed from the root r towards the leaves; the edge directed from v to u is denoted (v, u); v is the predecessor of u and u the successor of v; if there is a path from v to v' we say that v is an ancestor of v'; if there is no directed path between v and v' (in either direction) we say that the two vertices are disconnected. The set of successors</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">of v is denoted  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;successors&#125;(T,v)</span> . The  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;depth&#125;</span>  of a vertex v in T is denoted  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;depth&#125;(T,v)</span>  and equals the number of edges on the path from r to v. The depth of T is denoted  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;depth&#125;(T)</span>  and equals the maximum of  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;depth&#125;(T,v)</span>  as v ranges in V. The i-th  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;layer&#125;</span>  of T is denoted  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;layer&#125;(T,i)</span>  and equals the set of  <span class="math">v \in V</span>  such that  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;depth&#125;(T,v)=i</span> . (Note that  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;depth&#125;(T,v)=0</span>  and  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;layer&#125;(T,0)=\&#123;r\&#125;</span> .) An  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;equidepth&#125;</span>  tree is a tree in which all leaves have equal depth.</p>
      <span id="page-23-1"></span>**Definition 4.18.** Let C be a linear code with domain D and alphabet  $\mathbb&#123;F&#125;$ . A **recursive cover** of C is a directed rooted equidepth tree T of non-zero depth where each vertex v is labeled by a view  $(\tilde&#123;C&#125;_v, \tilde&#123;D&#125;_v)$  such that: (i)  $\tilde&#123;C&#125;_v$  is a linear code with domain  $\tilde&#123;D&#125;_v$  and alphabet  $\mathbb&#123;F&#125;$ ; (ii) if v is the root, then  $(\tilde&#123;C&#125;_v, \tilde&#123;D&#125;_v) = (C, D)$ ; and (iii) for every non-leaf v the set  $T_v := \&#123;(\tilde&#123;C&#125;_u, \tilde&#123;D&#125;_u)\&#125;_&#123;u \in \text&#123;successors&#125;(T,v)&#125;$  is a cover of  $\tilde&#123;C&#125;_v$ . Furthermore we define the following notions:
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-1 my-2">
        <li>Given  <span class="math">d \in \&#123;0, \ldots, \operatorname&#123;depth&#125;(T)\&#125;</span> , the d-depth restriction of T is  <span class="math">T|_d := \bigcup_&#123;v \in \operatorname&#123;layer&#125;(T,d)&#125; \&#123;(\tilde&#123;C&#125;_v, \tilde&#123;D&#125;_v)\&#125;</span> . (Note that  <span class="math">T|_0 = \&#123;(C,D)\&#125;</span> .)</li>
        <li>Given  <span class="math">c \in \mathbb&#123;N&#125;</span> , we say that T is c-intersecting if  <span class="math">|\tilde&#123;D&#125;_u \cap \tilde&#123;D&#125;_&#123;u'&#125;| \leq c</span>  for every two disconnected vertices u, v.</li>
        <li>Given  <span class="math">\kappa \in \mathbb&#123;N&#125;</span> , we say that T is  <span class="math">\kappa</span> -independent if  <span class="math">T_v</span>  is a  <span class="math">\kappa</span> -independent cover of  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;C&#125;_v</span>  for every non-leaf vertex v in T.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Remark 4.19.</strong> The above definition is restricted to equidepth trees, but can be extended to general trees as follows. Iteratively append to each leaf v of non-maximal depth a single successor u labeled by  <span class="math">(\tilde&#123;C&#125;_u, \tilde&#123;D&#125;_u) := (\tilde&#123;C&#125;_v, \tilde&#123;D&#125;_v)</span> ; this leads to a cover of  <span class="math">T_v</span>  that is 0-intersecting and  <span class="math">\kappa</span> -doubly independent for  <span class="math">\kappa</span>  that equals  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;C&#125;_v</span> 's dual distance.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Below we state the main lemma of this section. This lemma says that (given certain restrictions) if a recursive cover has the <em>local</em> property of <em>independence</em> (of some degree) at each internal vertex, then each of its layers has the <em>global</em> property of <em>locality</em> (of some degree) as a cover of the root. Later on (in Section 4.3.3) we show how cover locality is used to construct constraint detectors.</p>
      <span id="page-23-0"></span>**Lemma 4.20** (main). Let C be a linear code with domain D and alphabet  $\mathbb&#123;F&#125;$ , and let T be a recursive cover of C such that (i) T is c-intersecting for c &gt; 0, and (ii) for every non-leaf vertex v in T it holds that  $T_v$  is a  $\kappa$ -independent cover of  $\tilde&#123;C&#125;_v$ . Then, for every  $d \in \&#123;0, \ldots, \operatorname&#123;depth&#125;(T)\&#125;$ ,  $T|_d$  is a  $\frac&#123;\kappa&#125;&#123;c&#125;$ -local cover of C.
      <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof.</em> We prove the statement by induction on the non-negative integer d. The base case is when d=0, and holds because  <span class="math">T|_0=\&#123;(D,C)\&#125;</span>  is the trivial cover, thus it is a  <span class="math">\kappa'</span> -local cover of C for any  <span class="math">\kappa'\geq 0</span>  and, in particular, a  <span class="math">\frac&#123;\kappa&#125;&#123;c&#125;</span> -local cover. We now assume the statement for  <span class="math">d&lt;\operatorname&#123;depth&#125;(T)</span>  and prove it for depth d+1.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">T|_d=\&#123;(\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j,\tilde&#123;C&#125;_j)\&#125;_j</span>  be the d-depth cover of C, and let  <span class="math">T|_&#123;d+1&#125;=\&#123;(\tilde&#123;D&#125;_&#123;i,j&#125;,\tilde&#123;C&#125;_&#123;i,j&#125;)\&#125;_&#123;i,j&#125;</span>  be the (d+1)-depth cover of C, where, for every  <span class="math">i,T|_&#123;d+1&#125;^&#123;(i)&#125;=\&#123;(\tilde&#123;D&#125;_&#123;i,j&#125;,\tilde&#123;C&#125;_&#123;i,j&#125;)\&#125;_j</span>  is the cover of  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;C&#125;_i</span>  (this can be ensured via suitable indexing). Let J be a set of pairs (i,j) of size at most  <span class="math">\frac&#123;\kappa&#125;&#123;c&#125;</span> , and let  <span class="math">w'\in\mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;\tilde&#123;D&#125;_J&#125;</span>  be such that  <span class="math">w'|_&#123;\tilde&#123;D&#125;_&#123;i,j&#125;&#125;\in\tilde&#123;C&#125;_&#123;i,j&#125;</span>  for every  <span class="math">(i,j)\in J</span> .

      <p class="text-gray-300">For simplicity assume  <span class="math">I=\&#123;1,\ldots,|I|\&#125;</span> .

      <p class="text-gray-300">The purpose of this section is to establish sufficient conditions for succinct constraint detection by leveraging covers with small-enough views and large-enough locality. First, in Definition 4.21 and Lemma 4.22, we define <em>cover-based constraint detection</em> and prove that it implies succinct constraint detection; informally, we consider the case when a code has a sequence of covers where view size and locality reduce together, and prove that we can locally detect constraints in a number of views that is proportional to the constraint's weight and each view's size is proportional to the constraint's weight, by choosing the right cover from the sequence. Then, in Definition 4.24 and Lemma 4.25, we extend our discussion to recursive code covers by defining <em>recursive-cover-based constraint detection</em> and establishing that it implies the previous notion. We conclude (in Corollary 4.26) that recursive-cover-based constraint detection implies succinct constraint detection.</p>

We say that  $\mathscr&#123;C&#125;$  has **cover-based constraint detection** if there exists an algorithm that, given an index  $\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;$  and subset  $I \subseteq D(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;)$ , outputs in  $\operatorname&#123;poly&#125;(|\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;| + |I|)$  time a subset  $W \subseteq \mathbb&#123;F&#125;(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;)^&#123;D(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;)&#125;$  for which there exists a subset S' of some |I|-local cover S of  $C_&#123;\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;&#125;$ , and the following holds: (i)  $|S'| \leq |I|$ ; (ii)  $I \subseteq (\cup_&#123;\tilde&#123;D&#125;,\tilde&#123;C&#125;) \in S'&#125; \tilde&#123;D&#125;$ ); (iii)  $\operatorname&#123;span&#125;(W) = \operatorname&#123;span&#125;(\cup_&#123;(\tilde&#123;D&#125;,\tilde&#123;C&#125;) \in S'&#125; \tilde&#123;C&#125;^&#123;\perp&#125;)$ .

      <p class="text-gray-300">Proof of Lemma 4.22. By Lemma 4.6, it suffices to show an algorithm that, on input an index  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;n&#125;</span>  and subset  <span class="math">I\subseteq D(\mathbb&#123;n&#125;)</span> , outputs a subset  <span class="math">W\subseteq \mathbb&#123;F&#125;(\mathbb&#123;n&#125;)^&#123;D(\mathbb&#123;n&#125;)&#125;</span>  with  <span class="math">(C_&#123;\mathbb&#123;n&#125;&#125;^&#123;\perp&#125;)_&#123;\subseteq I&#125;\subseteq \operatorname&#123;span&#125;(W)\subseteq C_&#123;\mathbb&#123;n&#125;&#125;^&#123;\perp&#125;</span>  in  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;poly&#125;(|\mathbb&#123;n&#125;|+|I|)</span>  time. We take this algorithm to be the one guaranteed by Definition 4.21.

      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Given the above lemma, we can complete the proof of Theorem 4.12, as explained below. We defer the (long and technical) proof of the lemma to Appendix G, and instead end this section with an overview of that proof.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Proof of Theorem 4.12. The proof follows from Lemma 4.27 above and from Corollary 4.26, as we now explain.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Corollary 4.26 states that if a linear code family  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;C&#125;</span>  has recursive-cover-based constraint detection (see Definition 4.24), then  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;C&#125;</span>  has succinct constraint detection (see Definition 4.2). Also recall that the definition of recursive-cover-based detection requires having a c-intersecting recursive cover for each code in the class, and an algorithm satisfying certain properties.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Observe that Lemma 4.27 guarantees that every code in BS-RS has a 1-intersecting recursive code and, moreover, guarantees the existence of an algorithm whose output satisfies the required properties. We are left to argue that the algorithm runs in time  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;poly&#125;(|\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;|+|I|)</span> . But this immediately follows from the running time stated in Lemma 4.27 and the fact that  <span class="math">\log |\mathbb&#123;F&#125;| + \dim(L) + |\mathbb&#123;K&#125;|^&#123;\mu&#125; \leq \operatorname&#123;poly&#125;(|\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;|)</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Overview of Lemma 4.27's proof.</strong> We assume familiarity with the linear code family BS-RS from [BS08]; for completeness, we provide formal definitions and notations in Appendix F. Recall that the Reed–Solomon code is not locally testable, but one can test proximity to it with the aid of BS proximity proofs [BS08]; the linear code family BS-RS consists of the concatenation of Reed–Solomon codes with BS corresponding proximity proofs.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The construction of the aforementioned proximity proofs is <em>recursive</em>, with each step in the recursion reducing both the evaluation domain size |L| and the degree d to (approximately) their square roots. Namely, testing proximity of a</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">codeword w to  <span class="math">\mathrm&#123;RS&#125;[\mathbb&#123;F&#125;, L, d]</span>  is reduced to testing proximity of  <span class="math">\Theta(\sqrt&#123;|L|&#125;)</span>  codewords  <span class="math">\&#123;w_i\&#125;_i</span>  to  <span class="math">\&#123;\mathrm&#123;RS&#125;[\mathbb&#123;F&#125;, L_i, d_i]\&#125;_i</span> , where  <span class="math">|L_i|, d_i = \Theta(\sqrt&#123;|L|&#125;)</span>  for each i. This step is then recursively applied (by way of proof composition [AS98]) to each codeword  <span class="math">w_i</span> , until the domain size is "small enough".</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The first part of the proof of Lemma 4.27 consists of various combinatorial claims (see Appendix G.1). First, we observe that the union of the domains of the codewords  <span class="math">w_i</span>  covers (and, actually, slightly expands) the domain of the original codeword w; this holds recursively, and induces a recursive cover T (see Definition G.3). We prove that T is 1-intersecting (see Claim G.4) and that, for every vertex v in T of depth at most d, the cover  <span class="math">T_v</span>  is  <span class="math">(|L|^&#123;2^&#123;-d-1&#125;&#125; \cdot |\mathbb&#123;K&#125;|^&#123;-\mu-2&#125;)</span> -independent, which implies the stated independence property about  <span class="math">T_v</span>  (see Claim G.5). The core of the argument for this second claim is to show that the code  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;C&#125;_v</span>  equals BS-RS[ <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;K&#125;</span> ,  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span> ,  <span class="math">L_v</span> ,  <span class="math">\mu</span> , k] for some subspace  <span class="math">L_v</span>  such that  <span class="math">\dim(L) \cdot 2^&#123;-d&#125; \leq \dim(\tilde&#123;L&#125;) \leq \dim(L) \cdot 2^&#123;-d&#125; + 2\mu</span>  (see Claim G.6).</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The second part of the proof of Lemma 4.27 consists of establishing the computational efficiency of certain tasks related to the recursive cover (see Appendix G.2). Specifically, we bound the time required to compute a spanning set for covers in T (see Claim G.8). After a few more observations, we are able to conclude the proof.</p>
      <h2 id="span-id-page-27-0-span-5-sumcheck-with-perfect-zero-knowledge" class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4"><span id="page-27-0"></span>5 Sumcheck with perfect zero knowledge</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We obtain an IPCPP for sumcheck that is perfect zero knowledge against unbounded queries. (Since the input F is an oracle given to the verifier, the proof system is formally an exact IPCP of proximity for a promise relation.)</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Sumcheck.</strong> The sumcheck protocol [LFKN92, Sha92] is an IP for the claim " <span class="math">\sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in H^m&#125; F(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;) = 0</span> ", where F is a polynomial in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;&lt; d&#125;[X_1, \dots, X_m]</span>  and H is a subset of  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span> . The prover and verifier have input  <span class="math">(\mathbb&#123;F&#125;, m, d, H)</span>  and oracle access to (the evaluation table on  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;^m</span>  of) F. The sumcheck protocol has soundness error  <span class="math">1 - (1 - \frac&#123;d&#125;&#123;|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;|&#125;)^m</span> ; the prover runs in space  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;poly&#125;(\log |\mathbb&#123;F&#125;| + m + d + |H|)</span>  and the verifier in time  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;poly&#125;(\log |\mathbb&#123;F&#125;| + m + d + |H|)</span> ; the number of rounds is m; finally, the protocol is public coin and the verifier queries F only at one random point.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Leakage.</strong> The sumcheck protocol is <em>not</em> zero knowledge: a verifier, by interacting with the honest prover, learns partial sums of F, in addition to the fact that " <span class="math">\sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in H^m&#125; F(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;) = 0</span> " is true. Assuming one way functions, one <em>can</em> make any interactive proof, including the sumcheck protocol, to be (computational) zero knowledge [GMR89, IY87, BGG<sup>+</sup>88]; moreover, one-way functions are necessary for obtaining zero knowledge IPs for non-trivial languages [OW93]. As we do not wish to make intractability assumptions, we now turn to a different proof system model.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Perfect zero knowledge via IPCPPs.</strong> We obtain an IPCPP for sumcheck that is perfect zero knowledge against unbounded queries. Namely, a malicious verifier has oracle access to a proof string  <span class="math">\pi</span>  and also interacts with the prover, but learns no information about F beyond the fact that the statement about F is true, in the following sense. There exists an algorithm that perfectly simulates the verifier's view by making as many queries to F as the <em>total</em> number of verifier queries to either F or the oracle  <span class="math">\pi</span> . (Analogously to zero knowledge for proximity testers, a verifier may query F at any time, so any such information comes "for free" and, also, any query to  <span class="math">\pi</span>  'counts' as a query to F; see Section 3.3.) Our construction proceeds in two steps:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-1 my-2">
        <li>Step 1. We modify the sumcheck protocol to make it perfect zero knowledge, but in a hybrid model where the prover and verifier have access to a random polynomial  <span class="math">R \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;&lt; d&#125;[X_1, \dots, X_m]</span> . Crucially, soundness relies only on the fact that R is low-degree, but not the fact that it is random. Also, the modified protocol does *not* depend on a bound on the malicious verifier's queries, and thus maintains zero knowledge even against unbounded queries.</li>
        <li>Step 2. We observe that in the IPCPP model the prover can send an oracle proof string  <span class="math">\pi</span>  that represents the evaluation table of R, and the verifier can test that  <span class="math">\pi</span>  is close to low-degree, and then use self correction to query it. This extension preserves the zero knowledge properties of the previous step.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The more interesting of the two steps is the first one, so we briefly discuss the intuition behind it. Our idea is that, rather than executing the sumcheck protocol on F directly, the prover tells the verifier that  <span class="math">\sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in H^m&#125; R(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;) = z</span> , then they engage in the sumcheck protocol on the claim  <span class="math">\sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in H^m&#125; \rho F(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;) + R(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;) = z</span> , where  <span class="math">\rho</span>  is chosen at random by the verifier (after R is sampled). Completeness is clear because if  <span class="math">\sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in H^m&#125; F(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;) = 0</span>  and  <span class="math">\sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in H^m&#125; R(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;) = z</span>  then  <span class="math">\sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in H^m&#125; (\rho F + R)(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;) = z</span> ; soundness is also clear because if  <span class="math">\sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in H^m&#125; F(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;) \neq 0</span>  then  <span class="math">\sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in H^m&#125; (\rho F + R)(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;) \neq z</span>  with high probability over  <span class="math">\rho</span>  (regardless of whether  <span class="math">\sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in H^m&#125; R(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;) = z</span>  or not). We are thus left to show perfect zero knowledge, which turns out to be a much less straightforward argument.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">On the surface, perfect zero knowledge appears easy to argue: simply note that  <span class="math">\rho F + R</span>  is random among all polynomials in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;&lt; d&#125;[X_1,\ldots,X_m]</span> . However, this argument, while compelling, is not enough. First,  <span class="math">\rho F + R</span>  is not random because a malicious verifier can choose  <span class="math">\rho</span>  depending on queries to R; we discuss this issue further down below. Second, even if  <span class="math">\rho F + R</span>  were random (e.g., the verifier does not query R before choosing  <span class="math">\rho</span> ), the simulator must run in polynomial time but it is not clear how that is possible, as we now explain.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Consider the following simulator: (1) sample a random polynomial  <span class="math">Q_&#123;\text&#123;sim&#125;&#125; \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;&lt; d&#125;[X_1, \dots, X_m]</span>  and use it to simulate  <span class="math">\rho F + R</span> ; (2) whenever the verifier queries  <span class="math">F(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)</span> , respond by querying  <span class="math">F(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)</span>  and returning the true value; (3) whenever the verifier queries  <span class="math">R(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)</span> , respond by querying  <span class="math">F(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)</span>  and returning  <span class="math">Q_&#123;\text&#123;sim&#125;&#125;(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;) - \rho F(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)</span> . One can argue that the simulator produces the correct distribution; moreover, the number of queries to F made by the simulator equals the number of (mutually) distinct queries to F and R made by the verifier, as desired.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">But how does the simulator sample a random polynomial in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;&lt; d&#125;[X_1, \dots, X_m]</span>  in polynomial time? The size of the representation of such a polynomial is  <span class="math">\Omega(d^m)</span> , which is exponential. We get around this problem by exploiting the fact that the number of queries the verifier can make is polynomially bounded, and the simulator can keep state about the answers to past queries and 'make up' on the fly the answer to a new query by resolving dependencies between queries.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">More precisely, we leverage our construction of a succinct constraint detector for evaluations of low-degree polynomials (see Section 4.2), which itself relies on tools borrowed from algebraic complexity theory. The same detector also allows to simulate <em>partial sums</em>, which the prover sends in the course of the sumcheck protocol itself.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, we explain how we address the issue that the verifier may choose to query R before sending  <span class="math">\rho</span> . We handle this by first (implicitly) sampling a random polynomial  <span class="math">R_&#123;\rm sim&#125;</span> , and responding to each verifier query to  <span class="math">R(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)</span>  with  <span class="math">R_&#123;\rm sim&#125;(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)</span> . Then, when the verifier sends  <span class="math">\rho</span> , we draw  <span class="math">Q_&#123;\rm sim&#125;</span>  conditioned on the already-queried values for R being 'correct'; i.e., for each point  <span class="math">\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;</span>  queried before  <span class="math">\rho</span>  is sent, we add the condition that  <span class="math">Q_&#123;\rm sim&#125;(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;) = \rho F(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;) + R_&#123;\rm sim&#125;(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)</span> . We then continue as described above, and it is not too difficult to argue that this strategy yields the correct distribution.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We are now ready to turn the above discussions into formal definitions and proofs. First, we give the definition of the sumcheck relation and of a PZK IPCPP system for sumcheck; then we state and prove the PZK Sumcheck Theorem.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof.</em> We argue first completeness, then soundness, and, finally, perfect zero knowledge.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Completeness.</strong> If both F sums to v on  <span class="math">H^m</span>  and R sums to z on  <span class="math">H^m</span> , then  <span class="math">Q := \rho F + R</span>  sums to  <span class="math">\rho v + z</span>  on  <span class="math">H^m</span>  for every choice of  <span class="math">\rho</span> . Then completeness follows from the completeness of standard sumcheck.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Soundness.</strong> For every  <span class="math">F, R \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;&lt; d&#125;[X_1, \dots, X_m]</span>  with  <span class="math">\sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in H^m&#125; F(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;) \neq v, \sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in H^m&#125; Q(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)</span>  equals  <span class="math">\rho v + z</span>  for at most one choice of  <span class="math">\rho</span> , namely,  <span class="math">(\sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in H^m&#125; R(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;) - z)/(v - \sum_&#123;\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in H^m&#125; F(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;))</span> . Thus, except with probability  <span class="math">1/|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;|</span> , the sumcheck protocol is invoked on an incorrect claim, which incurs a soundness error of at most  <span class="math">\frac&#123;md&#125;&#123;|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;|&#125;</span> . The claimed soundness error follows by a union bound.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Perfect zero knowledge.</strong> We begin by proving perfect zero knowledge via a straightline simulator  <span class="math">S_&#123;\text&#123;slow&#125;&#125;</span>  whose number of queries to F equals  <span class="math">q_&#123;\tilde&#123;V&#125;&#125;</span> , but runs in time  <span class="math">\text&#123;poly&#125;(|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;|^m + q_&#123;\tilde&#123;V&#125;&#125;)</span> .

      <p class="text-gray-300">The IP described and analyzed in Section 5.1 is in the "R-hybrid" model. We now compile that IP into an IPCPP, by using proximity testing and self-correction, thereby concluding the proof of the PZK Sumcheck Theorem.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof of Theorem 5.3.</em> Construct an IPCPP system (P, V) for sumcheck as follows:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-1 my-2">
        <li>The prover P, given input  <span class="math">(\mathbb&#123;F&#125;, m, d, H, v)</span>  and oracle access to F, samples a uniformly random polynomial  <span class="math">R \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;&lt; d&#125;[X_1, \dots, X_m]</span>  and sends its evaluation  <span class="math">\pi \colon \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^m \to \mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span>  to the verifier V. Then P simulates  <span class="math">P_&#123;\mathrm&#123;IP&#125;&#125;^&#123;F,R&#125;(\mathbb&#123;F&#125;, m, d, H, v)</span> .</li>
        <li>The verifier V, after receiving a proof string  <span class="math">\pi \colon \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^m \to \mathbb&#123;F&#125;</span> , simulates  <span class="math">V_&#123;\mathrm&#123;IP&#125;&#125;^&#123;F,\pi&#125;(\mathbb&#123;F&#125;,m,d,H,v)</span>  up to  <span class="math">V_&#123;\mathrm&#123;IP&#125;&#125;</span> 's single query  <span class="math">\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^m</span>  to  <span class="math">\pi</span>  (which occurs after the interaction), which V does not answer directly but instead answers as follows. First, V checks that  <span class="math">\pi</span>  is  <span class="math">\varrho</span> -close to the evaluation of a polynomial in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;&lt; d&#125;[X_1,\ldots,X_m]</span>  by performing an individual-degree test with proximity parameter  <span class="math">\varrho := \frac&#123;1&#125;&#123;8&#125;</span>  and soundness error  <span class="math">\epsilon := \frac&#123;md&#125;&#123;|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;|&#125;</span>  [GS06, GR15]; then, V computes  <span class="math">\pi(\vec&#123;\alpha&#125;)</span>  via self-correction with soundness error  <span class="math">\epsilon</span>  [RS96, AS03], and replies with that value. Both procedures require poly(log  <span class="math">|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;| + m + d</span> ) queries and time.

In this case, let  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;R&#125;</span>  be the unique polynomial in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;&lt; d&#125;[X_1,\ldots,X_m]</span>  whose evaluation is  <span class="math">\varrho</span> -close to  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;\pi&#125;</span> ; this polynomial exists because  <span class="math">\varrho</span>  is less than the unique decoding radius (of the corresponding Reed–Muller code), which equals  <span class="math">\frac&#123;1&#125;&#123;2&#125;(1-\frac&#123;d-1&#125;&#123;|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;|&#125;)^m</span> , and is at least  <span class="math">\frac&#123;1&#125;&#123;4&#125;</span>  by the assumption that  <span class="math">\frac&#123;md&#125;&#123;|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;|&#125;&lt;\frac&#123;1&#125;&#123;2&#125;</span> .

However V only has access to  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;\pi&#125;</span> , and uses self-correction on it to compute  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;R&#125;</span>  at the single location  <span class="math">\vec&#123;\alpha&#125; \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^m</span>  required by  <span class="math">V_&#123;\mathrm&#123;IP&#125;&#125;</span> ; the probability that the returned value is not correct is at most  <span class="math">\epsilon</span> . Hence, by a union bound, V accepts with probability at most  <span class="math">\frac&#123;md+1&#125;&#123;|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;|&#125; + \epsilon</span> .</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Overall, we deduce that V accepts with probability at most  <span class="math">\max\&#123;\epsilon\,,\,\frac&#123;md+1&#125;&#123;|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;|&#125;+\epsilon\&#125;\leq 3\frac&#123;md&#125;&#123;|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;|&#125;.</span></p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 5.6 (is interaction needed?). One may be tempted to "flatten" the IPCPP used to prove Theorem 5.3, by sending a single PCP that already contains all possible transcripts, relative to all possible  <span class="math">\rho</span> 's. Such a modification does indeed preserve completeness and soundness. (In fact, even a small subset of  <span class="math">\rho</span> 's is enough for constant soundness error, because only one  <span class="math">\rho</span>  in  <span class="math">\mathbb F</span>  is "bad".) However, this modification does <em>not</em> preserve zero knowledge: if a verifier learns, say, the partial sums  <span class="math">\alpha_1 := \rho_1 F(\vec&#123;\gamma&#125;) + R(\vec&#123;\gamma&#125;)</span>  and  <span class="math">\alpha_2 := \rho_2 F(\vec&#123;\gamma&#125;) + R(\vec&#123;\gamma&#125;)</span>  for  <span class="math">\rho_1 \neq \rho_2</span>  and some  <span class="math">\vec&#123;\gamma&#125; \in \mathbb F^&#123;\leq m&#125;</span>  then he also learns  <span class="math">F(\vec&#123;\gamma&#125;) = \frac&#123;\alpha_1 - \alpha_2&#125;&#123;\rho_1 - \rho_2&#125;</span> , violating zero knowledge. (Yet, the modification <em>does</em> preserve <em>honest-verifier</em> zero knowledge.)</p>
      <span id="page-32-0"></span>**Remark 5.7** (space complexity of the prover). The prover in a zero knowledge protocol is a probabilistic function, and hence reads bits from its randomness tape. In the case of the above protocol, the prover P must sample the evaluation of a random polynomial R in  $\mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;&lt; d&#125;[X_1, \ldots, X_m]$ ; the entropy of R is exponential and thus requires reading an exponential number of random bits from the randomness tape. (Beyond this, P requires no other randomness.)
      <p class="text-gray-300">It is easy to see that P can run in exponential time and space. However, if the prover has two-way access to its random tape, P can run in exponential time and polynomial space: the prover treats the random tape as the coefficients of R, computing an evaluation at a given point by reading the tape coefficient-by-coefficient and summing the contributions of each monomial.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Two-way access to the randomness tape is a relaxation of the standard definition, which permits only <em>one</em>-way access to it [Nis93]; that is, random bits must be stored on the work tape in order to be accessed again. It is not known whether the relaxation makes polynomial-space machines more powerful for decision problems (the class is equivalent to "almost"-<strong>PSPACE</strong> [BVW98]), nor do we know how to obtain a polynomial-space prover with only one-way access. Nevertheless, we believe that polynomial space with two-way access to the random tape is still quite meaningful, e.g., it yields standard polynomial space relative to a random oracle.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>PCPs of proximity for codes.</strong> A <em>PCP of Proximity</em> [DR04, BGH<sup>+</sup>06] for a code family  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;C&#125; = \&#123;C_n\&#125;_n</span>  is a pair  <span class="math">(P_&#123;\mathscr&#123;C&#125;&#125;, V_&#123;\mathscr&#123;C&#125;&#125;)</span>  where for every index n and  <span class="math">w \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;D(n)&#125;</span> : if  <span class="math">w \in C_n</span>  then  <span class="math">V_&#123;\mathscr&#123;C&#125;&#125;^&#123;w,\pi&#125;(n)</span>  accepts with probability 1 with  <span class="math">\pi := P(n,w)</span> ; if w is 'far' from  <span class="math">C_n</span>  then  <span class="math">w \in C_n</span>  rejects with high probability regardless of  <span class="math">\pi</span> . We do not formally define this notion because it is a special case of a 1-round IOP of Proximity (see Section 3.2.3) where the verifier message is empty; we use  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;PCPP&#125;[\mathsf&#123;I&#125;, \mathsf&#123;q&#125;, \varepsilon, \delta, \mathsf&#123;tp&#125;, \mathsf&#123;tv&#125;]</span>  to denote the corresponding complexity class. Note that, since both  <span class="math">\pi</span>  and w are provided as oracles to V, the query complexity of V is the <em>total</em> number of queries across both oracles.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Leakage from proximity proofs.</strong> While proximity proofs facilitate local testing, they are a liability for zero knowledge: in principle even a single query to  <span class="math">\pi</span>  may 'summarize' information that needs many queries to w to simulate. (This holds for BS proximity proofs [BS08], for instance.) Our construction facilitates local testing while avoiding this leakage.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Perfect zero knowledge IOPs of Proximity.</strong> The notion of zero knowledge for IOPs of Proximity that we target is defined in Section 3.3.2 and is analogous to [IW14]'s notion for PCPs of Proximity (a special case of our setting). Informally, it requiress an algorithm that simulates the verifier's view by making as many queries to w as the <em>total</em> number of verifier queries to either w or any oracles sent by the prover; intuitively, this means that any bit of any message oracle reveals no more information than one bit of w.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">A generic 'masking' construction. Suppose that the linear code family  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;C&#125; = \&#123;C_n\&#125;_n</span>  has a PCP of Proximity. Consider the 2-round IOP of Proximity that uses masking via random self-reducibility (similarly to [BCGV16]) as follows. The prover and verifier have input  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;R&#125;</span>  and oracle access to a codeword w, and the prover wants to convince the verifier that w is close to  <span class="math">C_n</span> . Rather than sending a proximity proof for w, the prover samples a random codeword  <span class="math">z \in C_n</span>  and sends it to the verifier; the verifier replies with a random field element  <span class="math">\rho</span> ; the prover sends a proximity proof for the new codeword  <span class="math">\rho w + z</span> . Completeness follows from linearity of  <span class="math">C_n</span> ; soundness follows from the fact that if w is far from  <span class="math">C_n</span>  then so is the word  <span class="math">\rho w + z</span>  for every z with high probability over  <span class="math">\rho</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Perfect zero knowledge intuitively follows from the observation that  <span class="math">\rho w + z</span>  is essentially a random codeword (up to malicious choice of  <span class="math">\rho</span> ). We formally prove this for the case where the linear code family consisting of the concatenation of codewords in  <span class="math">\mathscr C</span>  with corresponding proximity proofs has succinct constraint detection.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We are now ready to turn the above discussions into formal definitions and proofs.

      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Remark 7.4</strong> (the case of LTCs). It is tempting to apply Theorem 7.3 to the notable special case where the proximity proof is <em>empty</em> (e.g., when  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;C&#125;</span>  is locally testable so no proximity proofs are needed). However, in this case, the zero knowledge guarantee of our construction does not buy anything compared to when the verifier queries only the codeword (indeed, the verifier <em>already</em> learns precisely the value of codeword at those positions which it queries and nothing else).</p>
      <span id="page-35-0"></span>**Construction 7.5.** The IOPP system (P, V) is defined as follows. The prover receives a pair (n, w) as input, while the verifier receives the index n as input and w as an oracle. The interaction proceeds as follows:
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-1 my-2">
        <li>1. P samples a random codeword z in  <span class="math">C_n</span>  and sends z to V;</li>
        <li>2. V samples a random element  <span class="math">\rho</span>  in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;(n)</span>  and sends  <span class="math">\rho</span>  to P;</li>
        <li>3. P computes the proof  <span class="math">\pi := P_&#123;\mathscr&#123;C&#125;&#125;(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;, \rho w + z)</span>  and sends  <span class="math">\pi</span>  to V;</li>
        <li>4. V checks that  <span class="math">V_&#123;\mathscr&#123;C&#125;&#125;^&#123;w',\pi&#125;(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;)</span>  accepts, where  <span class="math">w' := \rho w + z</span>  (any query  <span class="math">\alpha</span>  to w' is computed as  <span class="math">\rho w(\alpha) + z(\alpha)</span> ).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-300">The round complexity, proof length, query complexity, and prover and verifier complexities claimed in Theorem 7.3 follow in a straightforward way from Construction 7.5. We now argue completeness and soundness (Claim 7.6) and perfect zero knowledge (Claim 7.7).</p>
      <span id="page-35-1"></span>**Claim 7.6.** The IOPP system
      <div class="math-block">(P,V)</div>
      <p class="text-gray-300">has completeness 1 and soundness error  <span class="math">\varepsilon(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;) = \varepsilon_&#123;\mathscr&#123;C&#125;&#125;(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;) + \frac&#123;1&#125;&#123;|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;)|&#125;</span></p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof.</em> First we argue completeness. Suppose that the instance-witness pair (n, w) is in the relation  <span class="math">Rel(\mathscr&#123;C&#125;)</span> , i.e., that the word w is in the code  <span class="math">C_n</span> . Then, the linearity of  <span class="math">C_n</span>  implies that, for every word z in  <span class="math">C_n</span>  and element  <span class="math">\rho</span>  in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;(n)</span> , the word  <span class="math">\rho w + z</span>  is also in  <span class="math">C_n</span> . Thus completeness of (P, V) follows from the completeness of  <span class="math">(P_&#123;\mathscr&#123;C&#125;&#125;, V_&#123;\mathscr&#123;C&#125;&#125;)</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Next we argue soundness. Suppose that w is  <span class="math">2\delta_&#123;\mathscr&#123;C&#125;&#125;(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;)</span> -far from  <span class="math">C_&#123;\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;&#125;</span> . For every word z in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;)^&#123;\ell(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;)&#125;</span>  (not necessarily in  <span class="math">C_&#123;\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;&#125;</span> ), there exists at most one  <span class="math">\rho</span>  in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;)</span>  such that  <span class="math">\rho w + z</span>  is  <span class="math">\delta_&#123;\mathscr&#123;C&#125;&#125;(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;)</span> -close to  <span class="math">C_&#123;\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;&#125;</span>  (see Claim 3.1). The soundness of  <span class="math">(P_&#123;\mathscr&#123;C&#125;&#125;, V_&#123;\mathscr&#123;C&#125;&#125;)</span>  implies that  <span class="math">V_&#123;\mathscr&#123;C&#125;&#125;</span>  accepts with probability at most  <span class="math">\varepsilon_&#123;\mathscr&#123;C&#125;&#125;(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;)</span>  if  <span class="math">V_&#123;\mathscr&#123;C&#125;&#125;</span>  is invoked on a word that is  <span class="math">\delta_&#123;\mathscr&#123;C&#125;&#125;(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;)</span> -far from  <span class="math">C_&#123;\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;&#125;</span> . Thus, since V invokes  <span class="math">V_&#123;\mathscr&#123;C&#125;&#125;</span>  on the word  <span class="math">\rho w + z</span> , the probability that V accepts is at most  <span class="math">\varepsilon_&#123;\mathscr&#123;C&#125;&#125;(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;) + \frac&#123;1&#125;&#123;|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;)|&#125;</span> .</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">First, note that if  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;L&#125;</span>  has constraint detection with a certain efficiency then so does  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;C&#125;</span>  with the same efficiency. The theorem's hypothesis says that  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;L&#125;</span>  has succinct constraint detection; so both  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;C&#125;</span>  and  <span class="math">\mathscr&#123;L&#125;</span>  have succinct constraint detection.

      <p class="text-gray-300">We conclude with a lemma that says that succinct constraint detection is in some sense inherent to the "masking" approach used in Construction 7.5.</p>

        <li>4.

      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-300">By PZK, there is a probabilistic polynomial time algorithm S such that the output of  <span class="math">S^&#123;\bar&#123;V&#125;,w&#125;(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;)</span>  is identically distributed to View  <span class="math">\langle P^w(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;), \tilde&#123;V&#125;^w \rangle</span> , for every  <span class="math">w \in C_&#123;\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;&#125;</span> . Set w to be the zero codeword, and suppose we run  <span class="math">S^&#123;\bar&#123;V&#125;,w&#125;(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;)</span> ; this invocation makes S sample answers  <span class="math">(\beta_i)_&#123;i \in I&#125; = (z'(i))_&#123;i \in I&#125;</span>  for  <span class="math">z' = z \| P_&#123;\mathscr&#123;C&#125;&#125;(\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;, z)</span>  uniformly random in  <span class="math">L_&#123;\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;&#125;</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Thus, to perform constraint detection in probabilistic polynomial time, we proceed as follows.

      <p class="text-gray-300">We now argue correctness of the above approach.

Next, the probability that there exists  <span class="math">u \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^I</span>  in the nullspace of B such that  <span class="math">\sum_&#123;i \in I&#125; u(i)w'(i) \neq 0</span>  for some  <span class="math">w' \in L_n</span>  is at most  <span class="math">1/|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;|^&#123;k-|I|&#125;</span> . Indeed, for every such u,  <span class="math">\Pr_&#123;z' \leftarrow L_n&#125;[\sum_&#123;i \in I&#125; u(i)z'(i) = 0] \leq 1/|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;|</span>  (since  <span class="math">L_n</span>  is a linear code), so the probability that u is in the nullspace of B is at most  <span class="math">1/|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;|^k</span> ; we then obtain the claimed probability by a union bound. Overall, the probability that the algorithm answers incorrectly is at most  <span class="math">1/|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;|^&#123;k-|I|&#125;</span> .</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">Moreover, the verifier V is public-coin and non-adaptive.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Our proof is similar to that of [BCGV16], and the only major difference is that [BCGV16]'s simulator explicitly samples random codewords, while we rely on succinct constraint detection to do so implicitly. Indeed, the reduction from  <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;NTIME&#125;(T)</span>  generates codewords of size O(T), which means that sampling random codewords of that size is infeasible when T is super-polynomial. We structure our argument in three steps, highlighting the essential components that implicitly underlie [BCGV16]'s 'monolithic' argument; we view this as a conceptual contribution of our work.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Step 1 (Section 8.1). We construct perfect zero knowledge IOPs of Proximity for linear algebraic constraint satisfaction problems (LACSPs) [BCGV16], a family of constraint satisfaction problems whose domain and range are linear codes. An instance x of LACSP is specified by a function g and a pair of codes  <span class="math">C_0</span> ,  <span class="math">C_1</span> ; a witness w for x is a pair  <span class="math">(w_0, w_1)</span>  such that  <span class="math">w_0 \in C_0</span> ,  <span class="math">w_1 \in C_1</span> , and  <span class="math">g(w_0) = w_1</span> . A natural approach to construct a perfect zero knowledge IOPP for this relation is the following: if we are given a perfect zero knowledge IOP of Proximity for the relation  <span class="math">Rel(C_0 \times C_1)</span> , then the verifier can test proximity of  <span class="math">w = (w_0, w_1)</span>  to  <span class="math">C_0 \times C_1</span>  and then sample a random index j and check that  <span class="math">g(w_0)[j] = w_1[j]</span> . In order for the verifier's strategy to make sense, we require g to (i) satisfy a distance condition with respect to  <span class="math">C_0, C_1</span> , namely, that  <span class="math">C_1 \cup g(C_0)</span>  has large relative distance; (ii) be 'local', which means that computing  <span class="math">g(w_0)[j]</span>  requires examining only a few indices of  <span class="math">w_0</span> ; and (iii) be 'evasive', which means that if  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;w&#125;_0</span>  is close to some  <span class="math">w_0 \in C_0</span> , then  <span class="math">g(\tilde&#123;w&#125;_0)</span>  is close to  <span class="math">g(w_0)</span> . All of this implies that if  <span class="math">(\tilde&#123;w&#125;_0, \tilde&#123;w&#125;_1)</span>  is far from any valid witness but close to  <span class="math">C_0 \times C_1</span> , we know that  <span class="math">g(\tilde&#123;w&#125;_0)</span>  is far from  <span class="math">\tilde&#123;w&#125;_1</span> , so that examining a random index j gives good soundness.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Step 2 (Section 8.2). We build on the above result to derive perfect zero knowledge IOPs for a subfamily of LACSPs called randomizable LACSPs (RLACSPs) [BCGV16]. The key difference between this protocol and the IOP of Proximity described above is that in the "proximity setting", the verifier, and thus also the simulator, has oracle access to the witness, while in the "non-proximity setting" the witness is sent to the verifier but the simulator must make do without it; in particular, merely sending the witness  <span class="math">(w_0, w_1)</span>  is not zero knowledge. We thus rely on the randomizability property of RLACSPs to generate witnesses from a t-wise independent distribution, where t is larger than the query bound b. In particular, while the simulator runs in time polynomial in the actual number of queries made by a verifier, it runs in time polylogarithmic in t, and thus we can set b to be super-polynomial in order to obtain unbounded-query zero knowledge against polynomial-time verifiers.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Step 3 (Section 8.3). We derive Theorem 8.1 (perfect zero knowledge IOPs for NTIME(T)) by combining: (1) the aforementioned result for RLACSPs; (2) [BCGV16]'s reduction from NTIME to RLACSPs; (3) a perfect zero knowledge IOP of Proximity for a suitable choice of  <span class="math">C_0 \times C_1</span> , which we derived in Section 7.2. This last component is the one that makes use of succinct constraint detection, and relies on the technical innovations of our work.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">A constraint satisfaction problem asks whether, for a given "local" function g, there exists an input w such that g(w) is an accepting output. For example, in the case of 3SAT with n variables and m clauses, the function g maps  <span class="math">\&#123;0,1\&#125;^n</span>  to  <span class="math">\&#123;0,1\&#125;^m</span> , and g(w) indicates which clauses are satisfied by  <span class="math">w \in \&#123;0,1\&#125;^n</span> ; hence w yields an accepting output if (and only if)  <span class="math">g(w) = 1^m</span> . Below we introduce a family of constraint satisfaction problems whose domain and range are linear-algebraic objects, namely, linear codes.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We begin by providing the notion of locality that we use for g, along with a measure of g's "pseudorandomness".</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 8.2.</strong> Let  <span class="math">g: \Sigma^n \to \Sigma^m</span>  be a function. We say that g is q-local if for every  <span class="math">j \in [m]</span>  there exists  <span class="math">I_j \subseteq [n]</span>  with  <span class="math">|I_j| = q</span>  such that g(w)[j] (the j-th coordinate of g(w)) depends only on  <span class="math">w|_&#123;I_j&#125;</span>  (the restriction of w to  <span class="math">I_j</span> ). Moreover, we say that g is s-evasive if for every  <span class="math">I \subseteq [n]</span>  the probability that  <span class="math">I_j</span>  intersects I for a uniform  <span class="math">j \in [m]</span>  is at most  <span class="math">s \cdot \frac&#123;|I|&#125;&#123;n&#125;</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">For example, if g is a 3SAT formula then g is 3-local because  <span class="math">I_j</span>  equals the variables appearing in clause j; moreover, g is s-evasive if and only if every variable  <span class="math">x_i</span>  appears in at most a fraction s/n of the clauses (i.e., the evasiveness property corresponds to the fraction of clauses in which a variable appears). Also, a natural case where g is g-evasive is when the elements of  <span class="math">I_j</span>  are individually uniform in [n] when g is uniform in [m].</p>
      <span id="page-40-2"></span>**Definition 8.3.** Let  $g: \Sigma^n \to \Sigma^m$  be a function. We say that g is c-efficient if there is a c-time algorithm that, given j and  $w|_&#123;I_j&#125;$ , computes the set  $I_j$  and value g(w)[j].
      <p class="text-gray-300">The above definition targets succinctly-described languages. For example, a succinct 3SAT instance is given by a circuit of size S that, on input j, outputs a description of the j-th clause; the definition is then satisfied with c = O(S).</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">The above discussion achieves perfect zero knowledge for LACSPs, "up to queries to the witness". We now explain how to simulate these queries as well, without any knowledge of the witness, for a special class of LACSPs called randomizable LACSPs. For these, the prover can randomize a given witness  <span class="math">(w_0, g(w_0))</span>  by sampling a random u' in a t-wise independent subcode C' of  <span class="math">C_0</span> , and use the new 'shifted' witness  <span class="math">(w_0 + u', g(w_0 + u'))</span>  instead of the original one. We now define the notion of randomizable LACSPs, and then show how to construct perfect zero knowledge IOPs for these, against bounded-query verifiers and where the the query bound depends on t.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">We summarize prior work on <em>single</em>-prover proof systems that achieve zero knowledge unconditionally. First, the complexity classes of PZK IPs and SZK IPs are contained in AM ∩ coAM [\[For87,](#page-57-20) [AH91\]](#page-56-18), so they do not contain NP unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses [\[BHZ87\]](#page-57-4); thus, IPs have strong limitations. Next, we discuss other single-prover proof systems: PCPs and IPCPs; all prior work for these is about <em>statistical</em> zero knowledge (SZK), via simulators that are straightline (which is needed in many of the cryptographic applications explored in these works).</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">SZK PCP for NEXP. [\[KPT97\]](#page-58-12) obtain PCPs for NEXP that are SZK against unbounded queries; the PCP has exponential length, the honest verifier makes a polynomial number of queries, and malicious verifiers can make any polynomial number of queries. Their construction has two steps: (1) transform a given PCP into a new one that is PZK against (several independent copies of) the honest verifier; (2) transform the latter PCP into a new one that is SZK against malicious verifiers. The first step uses secret sharing and builds on techniques of [\[DFK](#page-57-7)<sup>+</sup>92]; the second uses <em>locking schemes</em>, which are information-theoretic PCP-analogues of commitment schemes. Subsequent work simplifies the steps: [\[IW14\]](#page-58-20) use MPC techniques to simplify the first step; and [\[IMS12,](#page-58-13) [IMSX15\]](#page-58-14) give a simple construction of locking schemes, by obtaining a non-interactive PCP-analogue of [\[Nao91\]](#page-58-23)'s commitment scheme.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">SZK PCP for NP against unbounded queries. A PCP must have super-polynomial length if it ensures SZK against any polynomial number of malicious queries: if not, a malicious verifier could read the entire PCP, in which case zero knowledge is impossible for non-trivial languages [\[GO94\]](#page-57-21). If one allows the prover to be inefficient, then invoking [\[KPT97\]](#page-58-12)'s result for any language in NEXP, including NP languages, suffices. Yet, in the case of NP, one can still aim for <em>oracle efficiency</em>: the prover outputs a succinct representation of the oracle, i.e., a polynomial-size circuit that, given an index, outputs the value at that index. However, [\[IMS12,](#page-58-13) [MX13,](#page-58-24) [IMSX15\]](#page-58-14) show that languages with oracle-efficient PCPs that are SZK against unbounded queries are contained in the complexity class of SZP IPs, which is unlikely to contain NP.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">SZK PCP for NP against bounded queries. [\[KPT97\]](#page-58-12) obtain PCPs for NP that are SZK against b malicious queries, for a given polynomially-bounded function b. The construction is analogous to the one for NEXP, but with different parameter choices. (The simplifications in [\[IMS12,](#page-58-13) [IMSX15,](#page-58-14) [IW14\]](#page-58-20) also apply to this case.)</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Subsequently, [\[IW14\]](#page-58-20) consider the case of zero knowledge PCPs <em>of proximity</em>; they obtain PCPPs for NP that are SZK against b malicious queries. Like [\[KPT97\]](#page-58-12), their construction has two steps: (1) use MPC techniques to transform a given PCPP into a new one that is PZK against (several independent copies of) the honest verifier; (2) use locking schemes to transform the latter PCPP into a new one that is SZK against malicious verifiers.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">SZK IPCP for NP against unbounded queries. For an IPCP to ensure SZK against any polynomial number of queries, the prover must send a PCP with super-polynomial length: if not, a malicious verifier could read the entire PCP, forcing the IPCP model to "collapse" to IP (recall that the complexity class of SZK IPs is unlikely to contain NP). As in the PCP model, one may still aim for oracle efficiency, and this time no limitations apply because a positive result is known: [\[GIMS10\]](#page-57-8) obtain oracle-efficient IPCPs for NP that are SZK against unbounded queries. Their construction is analogous to [\[KPT97\]](#page-58-12)'s, but relies on <em>interactive locking schemes</em> in the IPCP model, rather than non-interactive ones in the PCP model; this circumvents the impossibility result for oracle-efficient PCPs.</p>

We first  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;argue&#125; \operatorname&#123;span&#125;(W') \subseteq (C_n^\perp)_&#123;\subseteq I&#125;</span> , so let  <span class="math">z' \in \operatorname&#123;span&#125;(W')</span> , which can be represented as  <span class="math">z' = \sum_&#123;\lambda \in \Lambda&#125; a_\lambda \sum_&#123;z \in W&#125; \lambda(z) \cdot z</span> ; note that  <span class="math">z' \in \operatorname&#123;span&#125;(W) \subseteq C_n^\perp</span>  and  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;supp&#125;(z') \subseteq \operatorname&#123;supp&#125;(W) = I \cup \overline&#123;I&#125;</span> . Hence, it suffices to show that  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;supp&#125;(z') \cap \overline&#123;I&#125; = \emptyset</span> ; but this is true by the choice of  <span class="math">\Lambda</span> , because  <span class="math">M \cdot \lambda = 0</span>  for every  <span class="math">\lambda \in \Lambda</span> , so that  <span class="math">\sum_&#123;z \in W&#125; \lambda(w) \cdot z(\alpha) = 0</span>  for every  <span class="math">\alpha \in \overline&#123;I&#125;</span>  (by M's definition), so that  <span class="math">z'(\alpha) = \sum_&#123;\lambda \in \Lambda&#125; a_\lambda \sum_&#123;z \in W&#125; \lambda(z) \cdot z(\alpha) = 0</span>  for every  <span class="math">\alpha \in \overline&#123;I&#125;</span> , as required.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We next argue that  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;span&#125;(W')\supseteq (C_&#123;\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;&#125;^&#123;\perp&#125;)_&#123;\subseteq I&#125;</span> , and for this it suffices to show that any  <span class="math">w\in\operatorname&#123;span&#125;(W)</span>  having representation  <span class="math">w=\sum_&#123;z\in W&#125;a_z\cdot z</span>  such that  <span class="math">\vec&#123;a&#125;:=(a_z)_&#123;z\in W&#125;\notin\operatorname&#123;span&#125;(\Lambda)</span>  can not be in  <span class="math">(C_&#123;\mathfrak&#123;n&#125;&#125;^&#123;\perp&#125;)_&#123;\subseteq I&#125;</span> .

      <p class="text-gray-300">For completeness, we give an elementary proof of Lemma 4.11, by simplifying the proof of [Kay10, Thm. 10] for polynomials of the form we require; note that [RS05] and [BW04] also use similar techniques. We first introduce some notation. We consider a polynomial  <span class="math">Q \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;&lt; d&#125;[X_1,\ldots,X_m]</span>  equivalently as a univariate polynomial of degree less than d in  <span class="math">X_1</span>  with coefficients in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;&lt; d&#125;[X_2,\ldots,X_m]</span> , and let  <span class="math">\partial_1^j Q</span>  be the coefficient of  <span class="math">X_1^j</span>  in this representation. Define  <span class="math">\partial_1^j Q := (\partial_1^j Q_1,\ldots,\partial_1^j Q_\ell)</span> . In general, given an arbitrary arithmetic circuit representing a polynomial Q, it is not clear how to efficiently compute a circuit representing  <span class="math">\partial_1^j Q</span> , because Q may have exponentially many monomials. Nevertheless, for circuits of the required form, this computation is trivial.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Claim.</strong> Let</p>
      <div class="math-block">\vec&#123;Q&#125; := (Q_1, \dots, Q_\ell)</div>
      <p class="text-gray-300">be a vector of polynomials in  <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;&lt; d&#125;[X_1, \dots, X_m]</span> . If  <span class="math">d \leq |\mathbb&#123;F&#125;|</span>  then  <span class="math">\vec&#123;Q&#125;^&#123;\perp&#125; = \bigcap_&#123;i=0&#125;^&#123;d-1&#125; (\partial_i^j \vec&#123;Q&#125;)^&#123;\perp&#125;</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Proof. When  <span class="math">d \leq |\mathbb&#123;F&#125;|</span> ,  <span class="math">Q \in \mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;&lt; d&#125;[X_1, \dots, X_m] \equiv 0</span>  if and only if all of its coefficients are zero when written as a formal sum. Then one direction of the set equality follows straightforwardly from the linearity of  <span class="math">\partial_1^j</span> , namely,  <span class="math">\vec&#123;Q&#125;^\perp \subseteq \bigcap_&#123;j=0&#125;^&#123;d-1&#125; (\partial_1^j \vec&#123;Q&#125;)^\perp</span> . For the other direction, we argue as follows. Fix some  <span class="math">(a_1, \dots, a_\ell) \in \bigcap_&#123;j=0&#125;^&#123;d-1&#125; (\partial_1^j \vec&#123;Q&#125;)^\perp</span>  and let  <span class="math">T := \sum_&#123;k=1&#125;^\ell a_k Q_k</span> ; we have that  <span class="math">\partial_1^j T \equiv 0</span>  for all  <span class="math">j \in \&#123;0, \dots, d-1\&#125;</span> , by linearity. But  <span class="math">T = \sum_&#123;j=0&#125;^&#123;d-1&#125; (\partial_1^j T) X_1^j</span>  by definition, so  <span class="math">T \equiv 0</span> , and thus  <span class="math">(a_1, \dots, a_\ell) \in \vec&#123;Q&#125;^\perp</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Thus to compute a basis of  <span class="math">\vec&#123;Q&#125;^&#123;\perp&#125;</span>  it suffices to compute the intersection of the bases of  <span class="math">(\partial_1^j \vec&#123;Q&#125;)^&#123;\perp&#125;</span>  for all  <span class="math">j \in \&#123;0, \dots, d-1\&#125;</span> . The naive approach yields an exponential-time algorithm since we reduce the problem to d subproblems of roughly the same size. Observe, however, that for  <span class="math">Q_k</span>  of the specified form,</p>
      <div class="math-block">\partial_1^j Q_k = c_&#123;k,j&#125; T_k \quad \text&#123; where &#125; T_k := \left(\prod_&#123;i=2&#125;^m Q_&#123;k,i&#125;(X_i)\right) \;\;,</div>
      <p class="text-gray-300">for constants  <span class="math">c_&#123;k,j&#125;</span>  computable in time  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;poly&#125;(s)</span> . Let  <span class="math">\vec&#123;T&#125;:=(T_1,\ldots,T_\ell)</span>  and let  <span class="math">T^\perp\in\mathbb&#123;F&#125;^&#123;\ell\times b&#125;</span>  be a basis for  <span class="math">\vec&#123;T&#125;^\perp</span> ; note that  <span class="math">b\leq \ell</span> . Let  <span class="math">\vec&#123;a&#125;:=(a_1,\ldots,a_\ell)\in\mathbb&#123;F&#125;^\ell</span> , and observe that for each  <span class="math">j,\sum_&#123;k=1&#125;^\ell a_k\partial_1^jQ_k\equiv 0</span>  if and only if  <span class="math">\sum_&#123;k=1&#125;^\ell a_kc_&#123;k,j&#125;T_k\equiv 0</span> , or equivalently,  <span class="math">(a_1c_&#123;1,j&#125;,\ldots,a_\ell c_&#123;\ell,j&#125;)\in\vec&#123;T&#125;^\perp</span> . Hence  <span class="math">(a_1,\ldots,a_\ell)\in\bigcap_&#123;j=0&#125;^d(\partial_1^j\vec&#123;Q&#125;)^\perp</span>  if and only if for each j there exists  <span class="math">\vec&#123;v_j&#125;\in\mathbb&#123;F&#125;^b</span>  such that  <span class="math">T^\perp\vec&#123;v_j&#125;=(a_1c_&#123;1,j&#125;,\ldots,a_\ell c_&#123;\ell,j&#125;)</span> . This is a system of linear equations in  <span class="math">\vec&#123;a&#125;,\vec&#123;v_0&#125;,\ldots,\vec&#123;v_&#123;d-1&#125;&#125;</span>  of size  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;poly&#125;(\ell+d+b)</span> , and hence we can compute a basis for its solution space in time  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;poly&#125;(\log|\mathbb&#123;F&#125;|+d+\ell+b)</span> . Restricting this basis to  <span class="math">\vec&#123;a&#125;</span>  yields a basis for  <span class="math">\vec&#123;Q&#125;^\perp</span> .</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">If  <span class="math">Q_1,\ldots,Q_n</span>  are univariate then we can easily determine a basis for  <span class="math">\vec&#123;Q&#125;^\perp</span>  in deterministic polynomial time (by Gaussian elimination). Otherwise, if the  <span class="math">Q_i</span>  are m-variate, we use the procedure above to reduce computing  <span class="math">\vec&#123;Q&#125;^\perp</span>  to computing  <span class="math">\vec&#123;T&#125;^\perp</span>  for some  <span class="math">\vec&#123;T&#125;=(T_1,\ldots,T_\ell)</span>  where the  <span class="math">T_i</span>  are (m-1)-variate.

      <p class="text-gray-300">First we show that  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;span&#125;(\cup_&#123;j\in J&#125; \tilde&#123;C&#125;_j^\perp)\subseteq (C^\perp)_&#123;\subseteq \left(\cup_&#123;j\in J&#125; \tilde&#123;D&#125;_j\right)&#125;</span> . For every  <span class="math">j\in J</span>  and  <span class="math">z\in \tilde&#123;C&#125;_j^\perp</span> , it holds that  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;supp&#125;(z)\subseteq \tilde&#123;D&#125;_j</span> ; therefore, for every  <span class="math">z\in \operatorname&#123;span&#125;(\cup_&#123;j\in J&#125; \tilde&#123;C&#125;_j^\perp)</span> , it holds that  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;supp&#125;(z)\subseteq \cup_&#123;j\in J&#125; \tilde&#123;D&#125;_j</span> ; thus it is suffices to show that, for every  <span class="math">z\in \cup_&#123;j\in J&#125; \tilde&#123;C&#125;_j^\perp</span>  and  <span class="math">w\in C</span> , it holds that  <span class="math">\langle w,z\rangle=0</span> . But this holds because for every  <span class="math">z\in \cup_&#123;j\in J&#125; \tilde&#123;C&#125;_j^\perp</span>  there exists  <span class="math">j\in J</span>  such that  <span class="math">z\in \tilde&#123;C&#125;_j^\perp</span>  and  <span class="math">C|_&#123;\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j&#125;=\tilde&#123;C&#125;_j</span>  so that  <span class="math">\langle w,z\rangle=\langle w|_&#123;\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j&#125;,z\rangle=0</span> , as required.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">Next we show that  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;span&#125;(\cup_&#123;j\in J&#125;\tilde&#123;C&#125;_j^\perp)\supseteq (C^\perp)_&#123;\subseteq \left(\cup_&#123;j\in J&#125;\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j\right)&#125;</span> , which is equivalent to  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;span&#125;(\cup_&#123;j\in J&#125;\tilde&#123;C&#125;_j^\perp)\supseteq (C|_&#123;\cup_&#123;j\in J&#125;\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j&#125;)^\perp</span>  by Claim 4.5. Recall that for any two linear spaces U,V it holds that  <span class="math">U\subseteq V</span>  if and only if  <span class="math">U^\perp\supseteq V^\perp</span> , thus it is sufficient to show that  <span class="math">\operatorname&#123;span&#125;(\cup_&#123;j\in J&#125;\tilde&#123;C&#125;_j^\perp)^\perp\subseteq C|_&#123;\cup_&#123;j\in J&#125;\tilde&#123;D&#125;_j&#125;</span> , i.e., that every  <span class="math">w\in\operatorname&#123;span&#125;(\cup_&#123;j\in J&#125;\tilde&#123;C&#125;_j^\perp)^\perp</span>  can be extended to  <span class="math">w'\in C</span> .

      <span id="page-52-0"></span>Claim G.5. For every vertex v in layer(T,d), the cover  $T_v$  is  $(|\mathbb&#123;K&#125;|^&#123;\dim(L)\cdot 2^&#123;-d-1&#125;-\mu-2&#125;)$ -independent.

      <p class="text-gray-300">The proof of the above claim directly follows from Claim G.7 and Claim G.6, stated and proved below.

      <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof.</em> The proof is by induction on d. The base case d=0 follows directly from the definition; so we now assume the claim for d-1 and prove it for d.

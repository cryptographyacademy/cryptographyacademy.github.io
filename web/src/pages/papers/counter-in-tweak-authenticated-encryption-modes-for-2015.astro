      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold"><strong>1 Introduction</strong></h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Background on Authenticated Encryption. Confidentiality and authenticity of data are the two main security properties that one must ensure when communicating over an insecure channel. In the symmetric key setting, it has long been known how to ensure both of them independently, e.g., starting from a secure block cipher, by using a suitable encryption mode for confidentiality <a href="#page-27-0">[BDJR97]</a> and a block cipher-based MAC for authenticity <a href="#page-27-1">[BKR00]</a>. However, how exactly to combine both tools has long been left to the practitioners, leading to major security breaches <a href="#page-29-0">[Kra01,</a> <a href="#page-28-0">DR11,</a> <a href="#page-27-2">AP13]</a>. Sometimes, protocol designers even overlooked that authenticity was a necessary requirement besides confidentiality, as exemplified by padding oracle attacks <a href="#page-31-0">[Vau02]</a>. Even when the combination of the encryption and the MAC schemes is properly done, it might not be the most efficient solution, especially when the two parts rely on two different primitives. For these reasons, interest has shifted towards designing &quot;integrated&quot; Authenticated Encryption (AE) schemes ensuring jointly authenticity and confidentiality of data, which are more efficient and less likely to be incorrectly used. Besides, it has become standard for an AE scheme to have the ability to handle so-called associated data (AD), which are authenticated but not encrypted <a href="#page-30-0">[Rog02]</a> (such a scheme was for a time called an AEAD scheme, but since this feature is so important in practice, virtually all modern AE schemes provide it; we will only talk of AE in this paper, implicitly meaning AEAD). Even though ad-hoc AE schemes were already used since a long time, the formal treatment of these constructions only started around 2000 <a href="#page-27-3">[BN00,</a> <a href="#page-27-4">BR00,</a> <a href="#page-29-1">KY06]</a>. At about the same time, provably secure AE designs started to appear, such as IAPM <a href="#page-29-2">[Jut01,</a> <a href="#page-29-3">Jut08]</a>, XCBC <a href="#page-28-1">[GD01]</a>, CCM <a href="#page-31-1">[WHF02]</a>, OCB <a href="#page-30-1">[RBB03,</a> <a href="#page-30-2">Rog04a]</a>, or GCM <a href="#page-30-3">[MV04]</a>. The CAESAR competition <a href="#page-28-2">[CAE]</a> for authenticated encryption, started in 2014, recently put this research topic in the limelight. Various AE schemes were proposed, from purely ad-hoc designs to (tweakable) block cipher operating modes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Nonce-Misuse Resistance. Since most symmetric-key primitives (in particular block ciphers) from which AE schemes are built are deterministic, a random IV or a nonce (i.e., a value which must never be repeated for the same secret key) is a necessary ingredient for achieving strong security goals. Failing to ensure the corresponding requirement (high entropy for an IV, non-repetition for a nonce) can have dramatic consequences for security. For example, reusing a nonce just a single time for encrypting two messages in OCB completely breaks confidentiality: an attacker can immediately detect repeated message blocks since the corresponding ciphertext blocks will be equal. The non-repeating requirement on the nonce can be challenging to fulfill in some contexts, for example when encryption is implemented in a stateless device.<a href="#page-1-0">1</a> It is likely (and it has happened before) that some implementations will, e.g., simply generate nonces at random,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>1</sup> Similarly, the high-entropy requirement on the IV is hard to meet when no good randomness source is available.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&quot;hoping&quot; that no collision will occur. For that reason, a recent trend in AE has been to design schemes achieving <em>nonce-misuse resistance</em>, which informally means that the impact on security of a nonce repetition should be as limited as possible. This goal was first put forward by Rogaway and Shrimpton <a href="#page-30-4">[RS06]</a>, who formalized the notion of <em>misuse-resistant AE</em> (MRAE). For a scheme enjoying this property, authenticity is not harmed by nonce repetitions, while confidentiality is only damaged insofar as the adversary can detect whether the same triple of nonce, AD and message values is repeated. Example of schemes achieving this security notion are EAX <a href="#page-28-3">[BRW04]</a>, SIV <a href="#page-30-4">[RS06]</a>, AEZ <a href="#page-29-4">[HKR15]</a>, or GCM-SIV <a href="#page-28-4">[GL15]</a>. Because the MRAE notion cannot be achieved for an online scheme (since each bit of the ciphertext must depend on every bit of the plaintext), Fleischmann <em>et al.</em> <a href="#page-28-5">[FFL12]</a> proposed a relaxation of the MRAE notion called <em>online AE</em> (OAE), which can be achieved with a single pass on the input. Examples of schemes ensuring this security property are McOE <a href="#page-28-5">[FFL12]</a>, COPA <a href="#page-27-5">[ABL</a><sup>+</sup>13], or POET <a href="#page-27-6">[AFF</a><sup>+</sup>14]. However, the interest in the OAE notion has been recently reduced by some serious security concerns, notably the so-called chosen-prefix/secret-suffix (CPSS) generic attack <a href="#page-29-5">[HRRV15]</a>, that shares some similarities with the BEAST attack <a href="#page-28-0">[DR11]</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Birthday and Beyond-Birthday Security. Another important shortcoming of most AE operating modes is that they provide only birthday-bound security with respect to the block length of the underlying primitive. Since virtually all existing block ciphers have block length at most 128 bits (in particular the current block cipher standard AES), this means that security is lost at 2 <sup>64</sup> block cipher calls at best, which is low given modern security requirements (for 64-bit block ciphers, the situation is even more problematic). Moreover, this is rarely a problem with the tightness of the security proof: attacks matching the bound are often known. For example, Ferguson <a href="#page-28-6">[Fer02]</a> described a simple collision-based attack on OCB that breaks authenticity with 2 <sup>64</sup> blocks of messages. Recently, some AE schemes providing security beyond the birthday bound (BBB) were proposed <a href="#page-29-6">[Iwa06,</a> <a href="#page-29-7">Iwa08]</a>, but they usually come at an expensive performance price. One could argue that using a double-block-length block cipher would provide the expected security, but this solution comes with an important efficiency penalty (as can be seen in generic double-block-length block cipher constructions) and would be highly problematic for hardware implementations where internal state size is a major contribution to the total area cost.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">AE from Tweakable Block Ciphers. Compared with a conventional block cipher, a tweakable block cipher (TBC) <em><sup>E</sup></em><sup>e</sup> takes an additional input called a <em>tweak</em> bringing inherent variability to the primitive (equivalently, a TBC can be seen as a family of block ciphers indexed by the tweak). In the same paper that formalized the corresponding security notion <a href="#page-29-8">[LRW02]</a>, it was pointed out that a TBC was a very convenient starting point for building various schemes. In particular, for AE schemes, two prominent examples are the sibling modes TAE <a href="#page-29-8">[LRW02]</a> and &Theta;CB <a href="#page-29-9">[KR11]</a> (the TBC-based generalization of OCB). They have &quot;perfect&quot; security in the sense that, when used with an ideal TBC, the advantage of any adversary is zero against confidentiality and close to 2 <sup>&minus;</sup><em><sup>&tau;</sup></em> against</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">authenticity, where <em>&tau;</em> is the tag length. However, as already pointed out, a weakness of both TAE and &Theta;CB (even when used with an ideal TBC) is that their security completely collapses as soon as a nonce is repeated. As a matter of fact, existing AE schemes built from an ideal TBC either ensure perfect security in the nonce-respecting scenario only (like TAE or &Theta;CB), or fulfill the weak OAE notion only (e.g. COPA, once recast to use an ideal TBC), or ensure MRAEsecurity but only up to the birthday bound, even if nonces are not repeated (like AEZ). The PIV construction by Shrimpton and Terashima <a href="#page-31-2">[ST13]</a> allows to construct a variable-input-length TBC with BBB-security, which in turn allows to construct (via the Encode-then-Encipher method) an AEAD scheme with BBB-security against nonce-respecting adversaries and birthday-bound security against nonce-misusing ones. However, PIV requires as a building block a fixedinput-length TBC with <em>variable</em> tweak length (comparable to the maximal input length of the PIV construction), which in turn requires to appeal to universal hash functions with key length comparable to the maximal tweak length. Hence, the resulting AEAD scheme must use very large keys to ensure BBB-security for large messages. As of today, there is no AEAD scheme based on a fixed-tweak-length TBC that ensures both BBB-security in the nonce-respecting scenario and (at least) birthday-bound security in the nonce-misuse scenario. Yet this seems a very desirable goal since such a scheme would at the same time yield very high (BBB) security guarantees in the nominal, nonce-respecting use case and retain acceptable (birthday-bound) security when inadvertently misused.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our Contributions. In this paper, we propose the SCT (Synthetic Counterin-Tweak) nonce-based AE mode for tweakable block ciphers and prove that it ensures BBB-security in the nonce-respecting scenario, and birthday-bound security in the nonce-misuse scenario (in the strong MRAE sense <a href="#page-30-4">[RS06]</a>). More precisely, for the nonce-respecting case, when using an ideal TBC with block length <em>n</em> and &quot;effective&quot; tweak length<a href="#page-3-0">2</a> <em>w</em>, SCT is secure as long as the total number of <em>n</em>-bit blocks in encryption/decryption adversarial queries is less than roughly 2 (<em>n</em>+<em>w</em>)<em>/</em>2 , which is always larger than 2 <em>n/</em>2 . The SCT mode requires two passes (as is inevitable for MRAE-security), but it is simple, parallelizable, it requires the encryption direction only, it is particularly efficient for small messages compared to other nonce-misuse resistant schemes (no precomputation is required) and it allows incremental update of associated data.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With respect to how authentication and encryption are combined, our design draws inspiration from the SIV generic composition method <a href="#page-30-4">[RS06]</a>: the nonce <em>N</em>, the associated data <em>A</em>, and the message <em>M</em> are first input to a keyed function <em>FK</em>, yielding an pseudorandom initial value <em>IV</em> , which will serve as authentication tag. The message is then encrypted, using the generated <em>IV and the nonce N</em> (see Fig. <a href="#page-25-0">4)</a>. This &quot;recycling&quot; of the nonce in the encryption part of the mode is</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>2</sup> The SCT mode uses 5 tweak prefixes to separate the different usages of the TBC. The &quot;effective&quot; tweak length is what remains once 3 bits have been used to encode the prefix.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">what makes our high-level construction (called NSIV) crucially different from SIV and allows to reach BBB-security in the nonce-respecting case.<a href="#page-4-0">3</a></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It remains to instantiate the two components of the NSIV construction, the keyed function <em>F<sup>K</sup></em> and the encryption scheme. Since we aim at BBB-security in the nonce-respecting case, a natural starting point for <em>F<sup>K</sup></em> is the Wegman-Carter paradigm <a href="#page-31-3">[WC81,</a> <a href="#page-28-7">Bra82,</a> <a href="#page-30-5">Sho96]</a>. Hence, we propose a nonce-based MAC mode called PWC (<em>Parallel Wegman-Carter</em>) which combines a xor-universal hash function inspired from PMAC <a href="#page-27-7">[BR02,</a> <a href="#page-30-2">Rog04a]</a> applied to the AD and the message, and a simple pseudorandom function applied to the nonce. In order to achieve nonce-misuse resistance (which in general Wegman-Carter MACs do not provide), we add an additional encryption layer, which results in the EPWC (<em>Encrypted PWC</em>) mode.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The real challenge lies in designing an encryption scheme which is BBB-secure in the nonce-respecting case. Since on one hand it seems hard to leverage on the non-repeating property of the nonce without actually giving the nonce as input to the encryption mode, and on the other hand we need to make use in some way of the pseudorandom IV computed from <em>FK</em>, <a href="#page-4-1">4</a> it appears that what we need to design is actually a <em>combined nonce- and IV-based encryption scheme</em> (<em>nivE scheme</em> for short). To the best of our knowledge, this notion has never appeared before, and we introduce it in this paper. The encryption mode that we propose, called CTRT (<em>CounTeR in Tweak</em>), is a counter-like mode with the unusual property that the counter is applied on the tweak input of the underlying TBC rather than on the plaintext input, where the nonce comes in. The combination of EPWC and CTRT through the NSIV construction (the IV generated by EPWC being used as initial counter in CTRT) yields the SCT mode, illustrated in Fig. <a href="#page-5-0">1.</a></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For completeness, we also describe the CTPWC (CTRT<em>-then-</em>PWC) mode, an <em>online</em> nonce-based AE scheme which combines in an &quot;encrypt-then-MAC&quot; manner a slight variant of the CTRT encryption mode and the PWC authentication mode. The security guarantees provided by CTPWC are similar to those of &Theta;CB, but it is roughly twice less efficient, so that we do not claim that it is of particularly high interest. One small advantage that we see for this mode compared with &Theta;CB is that the nonce length can be as large as the block length of the underlying TBC, whereas for &Theta;CB the sum of the nonce length and of the maximal length of encrypted messages must be less than the tweak length of the underlying tweakable block cipher, which might be restrictive in some settings (e.g., for KIASU-BC <a href="#page-29-10">[JNP14c]</a>). It might also escape the patent issues which hindered the adoption of OCB.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Instantiating the TBC. As just discussed, our new AE modes offer BBBsecurity (in the nonce-respecting case) when used with an ideal TBC. If one aims at leveraging this security level in the real world, one must instantiate</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>3</sup> While SIV corresponds to generic composition method A4 in the nomenclature of Namprempre <em>et al.</em> <a href="#page-30-6">[NRS14]</a>, NSIV does not fit any of the NRS schemes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>4</sup> This excludes for example a simple OCB-like encryption mode since it is only noncebased, not IV-based.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">the TBC with care. Most existing TBCs are built from conventional block ciphers in a generic way, the prominent example being the XE/XEX construction <a href="#page-30-2">[Rog04a]</a> which only ensures security up to the birthday bound. Hence, using XE/XEX in our schemes would in a sense waste their nice security promises.<a href="#page-6-0">5</a> To remedy this problem, one can use either generic TBC constructions with BBB-security <a href="#page-30-7">[Min09,</a> <a href="#page-29-11">LST12,</a> <a href="#page-29-12">LS13,</a> <a href="#page-30-8">Men15]</a> (but they are often inefficient or provably secure in the ideal cipher model only), or ad-hoc TBC designs without known weaknesses. The second option was chosen for a number of CAESAR candidates <a href="#page-29-13">[JNP14a,</a> <a href="#page-29-14">JNP14b,</a> <a href="#page-29-10">JNP14c,</a> <a href="#page-28-8">GLS</a><sup>+</sup>14]. In fact, the SCT mode was explicitly designed as a replacement to the COPA mode used in versions 1.1 and 1.2 of CAESAR candidates Deoxys <a href="#page-29-13">[JNP14a]</a> (128-bit blocks, 128-bit tweaks) and Joltik <a href="#page-29-14">[JNP14b]</a> (64-bit blocks, 64-bit tweaks).<a href="#page-6-1">6</a> We refer to the submission documents of these two candidates for a detailed report on implementation results, which are quite competitive. Other potential candidates for instantiating the SCT mode are Scream <a href="#page-28-8">[GLS</a><sup>+</sup>14] and Threefish, the TBC on which the hash function Skein <a href="#page-28-9">[FLS</a><sup>+</sup>10] is based. There is currently a shift towards designing dedicated TBCs achieving higher security and efficiency than generic BC-based constructions, and we hope to see more and more TBC proposals that could be used with SCT.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Open Problems and Future Work. The CTRT encryption scheme has the notable feature that its security degrades gracefully with the maximal number of repetitions of nonces: when the nonce repetitions are limited, security remains close to the security bound in the nonce-respecting case. In contrast, the security of the EPWC authentication mode (and more generally of any encrypted Wegman-Carter MAC) falls back to birthday bound as soon as the adversary can repeat one single nonce twice (see Remark <a href="#page-24-0">2</a> in Section <a href="#page-18-0">5)</a>. It remains a pending question to modify EPWC so that it provides graceful security degradation with the maximal number of nonce repetitions as well. This would make the resulting AE scheme a good candidate for high security in both nonce-respecting and nonce-misuse models for most practical scenarios. Another challenging open problem would be to construct an AE scheme which remains BBB-secure even when nonces are arbitrarily repeated. The main difficulty is to build a deterministic, stateless, BBB-secure MAC, which is known to be notably hard <a href="#page-31-4">[Yas11,</a> <a href="#page-28-10">DS11]</a>. Another possible direction for future work would be to design a mode similar to SCT using only one pass and achieving online nonce-misuse resistance in the OAE sense <a href="#page-28-5">[FFL12]</a>. Such a feature would allow users to smoothly choose the best security achievable, depending on whether two passes can be tolerated or not by the application. Finally, it would be interesting to analyze how to strengthen SCT against other misuse scenarios such as release of unverified plaintext <a href="#page-27-8">[ABL</a><sup>+</sup>14], and to study how its security is affected by tag truncation <a href="#page-29-4">[HKR15]</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>5</sup> Similarly, the only reason why OCB is secure up to the birthday bound whereas &Theta;CB is &quot;perfectly&quot; secure is because it relies on XE/XEX for instantiating the TBC.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>6</sup> The tweak prefixes used in this paper were chosen for ease of exposition and are slightly different from the ones used in Deoxys and Joltik v1.3, which were chosen mainly for efficiency reasons.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Organization. In Section <a href="#page-7-0">2</a> we provide a high-level description of the various possibilities that we considered for constructing a BBB-secure nivE scheme. After introducing the notation and standard security notions in Section <a href="#page-8-0">3,</a> we describe the CTRT encryption scheme and prove its security in Section <a href="#page-12-0">4,</a> while we describe the PWC and EPWC nonce-based MAC schemes and prove their security in Section <a href="#page-18-0">5.</a> Finally, we explain how to combine CTRT and EPWC using the NSIV construction to build the nonce-based AE mode SCT and prove its security in Section <a href="#page-24-1">6.</a> In Appendix <a href="#page-35-0">C,</a> we describe the CTPWC mode, an online nonce-based AE mode derived from CTRT and PWC.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As motivated in introduction, our goal is to design a simple TBC-based AE scheme that provides BBB-security in the nonce-respecting setting and (at least) birthday-bound MRAE-security. As already mentioned, an encrypted Wegman-Carter MAC solves the problem for the authentication part, so that we focus here on encryption. Hence, our problem is as follows: given a nonce and a synthetic IV generated pseudorandomly from the nonce, the AD and the message, how do we use them to encrypt the message with BBB-security? We give a quick overview of the various constructions that we considered and why, except the CTRT encryption mode we propose, they fail or are unsatisfactory.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A natural direction to explore is to start from a scheme providing BBB-security for non-repeating nonces, such as TAE <a href="#page-29-8">[LRW02]</a> or &Theta;CB <a href="#page-29-9">[KR11]</a>, which are similar with regard to encryption: it simply consists in a &quot;tweakable&quot; codebook mode, the tweak holding the nonce and a message block counter. This is obviously not noncemisuse resistant: repeating the nonce a single time will lead to a complete break of confidentiality since a constant message block leads to a constant ciphertext block. One could incorporate the IV by simply concatenating it to the nonce and the counter to form the tweak. However, this would require a TBC with larger tweak, which is usually very costly to achieve.<a href="#page-7-1">7</a> Rather than concatenating the nonce and the IV, one could try to combine them into a single shorter string <em>S</em>, but this would presumably result in birthday security even in the nonce-respecting scenario (since a collision on <em>S</em> would directly break confidentiality). Hence, a codebook encryption mode does not seem to be a very convenient starting point.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For this reason, we preferred to consider a counter mode (note that this was the encryption mode favored by Rogaway and Shrimpton to instantiate the SIV composition method <a href="#page-30-4">[RS06]</a>). The question now is: how do we feed the nonce, the IV, and the <em>i</em>-th counter to the TBC in order to create the mask that will be xored to the <em>i</em>-th message block? We considered several possibilities (we do not claim this to be exhaustive):</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(a) One can put the nonce in the tweak input, and the sum of the IV and the counter in the plaintext input. The problem is that confidentiality caps at</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>7</sup> For example, for TBCs following the TWEAKEY approach <a href="#page-29-13">[JNP14a,</a> <a href="#page-29-14">JNP14b,</a> <a href="#page-29-15">JNP14d]</a>, there is a large gap in the number of rounds needed to make the TBC secure as the tweak length increases.</p>

      <li>birthday bound even in the nonce-respecting scenario: the adversary can query the encryption of a single message with 2 <em>n/</em>2 equal blocks, and observe that no collision occurs in the corresponding ciphertext blocks (since the nonce is fixed and all TBC calls use the same tweak), which will distinguish the ciphertext from a random string (for which a collision would be expected).</li>
      <li>(b) One can concatenate the nonce and the counter in the tweak input, and use the IV for the plaintext input. Since the tweak is different for each message block position, this solves the issue of the previous solution. We conjecture that this mode meets our security objectives, but an important drawback is that a larger tweak length is required and, as mentioned before, this is very costly.</li>
      <li>(c) One can put the sum of the nonce and the counter in the tweak input (instead of concatenating them) and the IV in the plaintext input. This mode might meet our security objectives, however the adversary can very easily provoke collisions on tweak inputs even in the nonce-respecting scenario, which might complicate the proof of BBB-security. Another drawback is that in the noncemisuse scenario, a collision on the IV immediately breaks confidentiality, which dashes any hope for BBB nonce-misuse resistance. Note that one could imagine variants where the nonce and the IV are first encrypted before being used, but it is not clear if this would prevent the issues just mentioned and this would presumably make the security proof quite complex.</li>
      <li>(d) Finally, one can put the sum of the IV and the counter in the tweak input and the nonce in the plaintext input, which is exactly the CTRT mode. We will prove in Section <a href="#page-12-0">4</a> that it meets our security goal. The first idea is that the counter in the tweak input ensures that all the calls to the internal TBC will use different tweaks for one single message query, so that the ciphertext looks uniformly random in that case. Thus, the adversary has to query several messages with different nonce values and hope that many collisions will occur between tweak inputs in order to observe a divergence from uniformity in the ciphertexts. However, these collisions are hard to control since they depend on the pseudorandom IV (in contrast with other modes discussed above, where the tweak input can be easily controlled by the adversary). Moreover, the nonce-misuse scenario helps the adversary only if it can repeat the same nonce a very high number of times until a collision happens on the tweaks, so that the security of the CTRT mode degrades gracefully with the maximal number of nonce repetitions.</li>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(which will be more convenient later), but it is easy to see that it is equivalent to the more conventional unforgeability-based definition.

    <p class="text-gray-300">In particular, if A is nonce-respecting (m = 1), one has</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Before proceeding to the proof, we comment the security bound of this theorem. Consider first the case of a nonce-respecting adversary A. Letting  <span class="math">\\mathcal{T} = \\{0,1\\}^w</span> , we see that  <span class="math">\\mathsf{CTRT}[\\widetilde{E}]</span>  is secure up to roughly  <span class="math">2^{(n+w)/2}</span>  message blocks, which is always larger than  <span class="math">2^{n/2}</span> . In particular, if w = n/2 (as e.g. for KIASU-BC [JNP14c]), then security is ensured up to roughly  <span class="math">2^{3n/4}</span>  message blocks. In the nonce-misuse scenario, note that the additional term  <span class="math">2(m-1)\\sigma/|\\mathcal{T}|</span>  remains small as long as nonces are not repeated too many times (e.g.  <span class="math">m \\leq 100</span> ) and  <span class="math">\\sigma \\ll |\\mathcal{T}|</span> , and</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"> <span class="math">&lt;sup&gt;^{10}&lt;/sup&gt;</span>  The CTRT mode does not need tweak separation per se. We use a single 1 prefix in order to conveniently combine CTRT with EPWC later.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">turns into a birthday-like term only in the extreme case where a few nonces are repeated close to  <span class="math">\\sigma</span>  times. This means that a few nonce repetitions will not hurt and that nonces must be &quot;seriously&quot; mishandled before security goes down to birthday bound.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">PROOF OF THEOREM 1. Fix a  <span class="math">(q&#x27;, m, |\\mathcal{T}|, \\sigma, t)</span> -adversary A against CTRT <span class="math">[\\widetilde{E}]</span>  (we denote q' the maximal number of adversarial queries and will later use q for the actual number of queries in a specific attack). The first part of the proof is standard, and consists in introducing an intermediate game where all calls to  <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}_K</span>  in the CTRT construction are replaced by calls to a random tweakable permutation  <span class="math">\\widetilde{P}</span> . Consider the following adversary A' against the TPRP-security of  <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}</span> . Let  <span class="math">G \\in \\{\\widetilde{E}_K, \\widetilde{P}\\}</span>  be the oracle to which A' has access. Adversary A' runs A, answers its encryption queries (N, M) by drawing a random IV and executing the code in Fig. 2 on input (N, IV, M), replacing calls to  <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}_K</span>  by oracle calls to G, and finally outputs the same bit as A. Clearly, A' makes at most  <span class="math">\\sigma</span>  oracle queries and runs in time at most  <span class="math">t + t_{\\text{CTRT}}(\\sigma)</span> . Moreover, it is easy to see that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">
<span class="math">$\\mathbf{Adv}^{\\mathrm{ivE}}_{\\mathsf{CTRT}[\\widetilde{E}]}(\\mathsf{A}) \\leq \\mathbf{Adv}^{\\mathrm{TPRP}}_{\\widetilde{E}}(\\mathsf{A}&#x27;) + \\delta, \\tag{1}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">
<span class="math">$\\delta = \\left| \\Pr \\left[ \\widetilde{P} \\leftarrow_{\\</span>} \\mathsf{TP}(\\mathcal{T}, \\mathcal{X}) : \\mathsf{A}^{\\mathsf{CTRT}[\\widetilde{P}].\\mathsf{Enc}^{$}} = 1 \\right] - \\Pr \\left[ \\mathsf{A}^{\\mathsf{Rand}} = 1 \\right] \\right| \\tag{2}$$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and  <span class="math">\\mathsf{CTRT}[\\widetilde{P}]</span>  is a slight abuse of notation for the  <span class="math">\\mathsf{CTRT}</span>  construction based on an arbitrary tweakable permutation  <span class="math">\\widetilde{P}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Upper bounding  <span class="math">\\delta</span>  is now a purely information-theoretic problem, so that we allow A to be computationally unbounded, and hence, wlog, deterministic. The adversary is now trying to distinguish between  <span class="math">\\mathsf{CTRT}[\\tilde{P}]</span>  for a random  <span class="math">\\tilde{P}</span>  (thereafter called the &quot;real world&quot;) and  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Rand}</span>  (thereafter called the &quot;ideal world&quot;). We assume wlog that A always makes queries of length a multiple of the block length n, and of total length  <span class="math">\\sigma</span>  blocks (if not, we pad all queries whose final block is incomplete with zeros for free, which can only increase the adversary's advantage).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Following the H-coefficients method [Pat08b, CS14], we summarize the interaction of A with its oracle in the so-called transcript of the attack</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\tau = ((N_1, M_1, IV_1, C_1), \\dots, (N_q, M_q, IV_q, C_q)),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">(N_i, M_i)</span>  denotes the <em>i</em>-th query of the attacker and  <span class="math">(IV_i, C_i)</span>  the corresponding answer of the oracle. Furthermore, we denote  <span class="math">M_i = M_{i,1} \\| \\cdots \\| M_{i,\\ell_i}</span> ,  <span class="math">C_i = C_{i,1} \\| \\cdots \\| C_{i,\\ell_i}</span> , where  <span class="math">\\ell_i</span>  is the number of blocks of the <em>i</em>-th message, and  <span class="math">IV_{i,j} = \\ln c^{j-1}(IV_i)</span>  the <em>j</em>-th counter for the <em>i</em>-th message,  <span class="math">j = 1, \\ldots, \\ell_i</span> . Let  <span class="math">\\Theta_{\\text{re}}</span> , resp.  <span class="math">\\Theta_{\\text{id}}</span> , denote the distribution of the transcript in the real world, resp. ideal world. We say that a transcript  <span class="math">\\tau</span>  is A-attainable (or simply attainable) if the probability to obtain  <span class="math">\\tau</span>  in the ideal world is non-zero. Note that the number of queries q and the lengths of the queries  <span class="math">\\ell_1, \\ldots, \\ell_q</span>  are themselves random variables</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(they can vary for distinct A-attainable transcripts), yet by the assumption that the attacker always asks the maximal number of allowed blocks throughout its queries, one always has  <span class="math">\\sum_{i=1}^{q} \\ell_i = \\sigma</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">From  <span class="math">\\tau</span>  we define for each possible tweak  <span class="math">T \\in \\mathcal{T}</span>  the &quot;load&quot; of the tweak as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$L(T) = |\\{(i, j) : IV_{i, j} = T\\}|.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In words, L(T) is the number of times the tweak T appears as a counter when encrypting the queries of the adversary. Clearly, one has</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">
<span class="math">$\\sum_{T \\in \\mathcal{T}} L(T) = \\sigma. \\tag{3}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The proof relies on the fundamental lemma of the H-coefficients technique (see e.g. [CS14] for the proof).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lemma 1.</strong> Assume that the set of A-attainable transcripts is partitioned into two disjoint sets GoodT and BadT, and that there exists  <span class="math">\\varepsilon_1</span>  and  <span class="math">\\varepsilon_2</span>  such that for any  <span class="math">\\tau \\in \\mathsf{GoodT}</span> , one has</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\frac{\\Pr\\left[\\Theta_{\\rm re} = \\tau\\right]}{\\Pr\\left[\\Theta_{\\rm id} = \\tau\\right]} \\ge 1 - \\varepsilon_1,</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and  <span class="math">\\Pr [\\Theta_{id} \\in \\mathsf{BadT}] \\leq \\varepsilon_2</span> . Then  <span class="math">\\delta \\leq \\varepsilon_1 + \\varepsilon_2</span> , with  <span class="math">\\delta</span>  as defined by (2).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We say that an attainable transcript  <span class="math">\\tau</span>  is bad if one of the two following conditions are met:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>(C-1) there exists  <span class="math">(i, j) \\neq (i&#x27;, j&#x27;)</span>  such that  <span class="math">IV_{i,j} = IV_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;}</span>  and  <span class="math">N_i = N_{i&#x27;}</span> ;</li>
      <li>(C-2) there exists  <span class="math">(i, j) \\neq (i&#x27;, j&#x27;)</span>  such that  <span class="math">IV_{i,j} = IV_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;}</span> ,  <span class="math">N_i \\neq N_{i&#x27;}</span> , and  <span class="math">M_{i,j} \\oplus C_{i,j} = M_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;} \\oplus C_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;}</span> .</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that condition (C-1) can only be satisfied for a nonce-misuse adversary, since (by the assumption that the length of each query is at most  <span class="math">|\\mathcal{T}|</span>  blocks of n bits so that counters do not loop)  <span class="math">IV_{i,j} = IV_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;}</span>  requires  <span class="math">i \\neq i&#x27;</span> , which implies that  <span class="math">N_i \\neq N_{i&#x27;}</span>  for a nonce-respecting adversary. Note also that the condition (C-2) can only be satisfied in the ideal world. Indeed, in the real world,  <span class="math">M_{i,j} \\oplus C_{i,j} = \\widetilde{P}(IV_{i,j}, N_i)</span>  and  <span class="math">M_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;} \\oplus C_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;} = \\widetilde{P}(IV_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;}, N_{i&#x27;})</span> , so that if  <span class="math">IV_{i,j} = IV_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;}</span>  and  <span class="math">N_i \\neq N_{i&#x27;}</span>  one necessarily has  <span class="math">M_{i,j} \\oplus C_{i,j} \\neq M_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;} \\oplus C_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We let BadT be the set of bad transcripts, and GoodT be the set of attainable transcripts which are not bad, henceforth called good transcripts. We first consider good transcripts.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lemma 2.</strong> Let  <span class="math">\\tau \\in \\mathsf{GoodT}</span>  be a good transcript. Then</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\frac{\\Pr[\\Theta_{\\mathrm{re}} = \\tau]}{\\Pr[\\Theta_{\\mathrm{id}} = \\tau]} \\geq 1.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof. Note that a good transcript has the property that for each  <span class="math">(i,j) \\neq (i&#x27;,j&#x27;)</span>  such that  <span class="math">IV_{i,j} = IV_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;}</span> , one has  <span class="math">N_i \\neq N_i&#x27;</span>  and  <span class="math">M_{i,j} \\oplus C_{i,j} \\neq M_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;} \\oplus C_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;}</span> . In other words, the transcript encodes a partial tweakable permutation, where for each tweak  <span class="math">T \\in \\mathcal{T}</span>  there are exactly L(T) distinct values  <span class="math">N_i</span>  mapped to some value  <span class="math">M_{i,j} \\oplus C_{i,j}</span> . The probability to obtain a good transcript  <span class="math">\\tau</span>  in the ideal and real worlds can now be easily computed. In the ideal world, since the  <span class="math">IV_i</span> 's and the  <span class="math">C_i</span> 's are uniformly random, one has</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\Pr[\\Theta_{id} = \\tau] = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{I}\\mathcal{V}|^q \\cdot |\\mathcal{X}|^\\sigma}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the real world, the  <span class="math">IV_i</span> 's are random as well, but now the probability to obtain the  <span class="math">C_i</span> 's can easily be seen to be the probability that the random tweakable permutation  <span class="math">\\widetilde{P}</span>  is compatible with the partial tweakable permutation encoded by  <span class="math">\\tau</span>  [CS14]. Hence, one has</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\Pr[\\Theta_{\\mathrm{re}} = \\tau] = \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{I}\\mathcal{V}|^q} \\cdot \\prod_{T \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\frac{1}{(|\\mathcal{X}|)_{L(T)}},</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">(a)_b</span>  denotes the falling factorial  <span class="math">a(a-1)\\cdots(a-b+1)</span> , with  <span class="math">(a)_0=1</span>  by convention. From this and Eq. (3), we deduce that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\frac{\\Pr[\\Theta_{\\text{re}} = \\tau]}{\\Pr[\\Theta_{\\text{id}} = \\tau]} = \\frac{|\\mathcal{X}|^{\\sigma}}{\\prod_{T \\in \\mathcal{T}} (|\\mathcal{X}|)_{L(T)}} = \\prod_{T \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\frac{|\\mathcal{X}|^{L(T)}}{(|\\mathcal{X}|)_{L(T)}} \\ge 1.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It remains to upper bound the probability to obtain a bad transcript in the ideal world. For  <span class="math">i \\in \\{1, 2\\}</span> , let  <span class="math">\\mathsf{BadT}_i</span>  be the set of attainable transcripts satisfying condition (C-i).

    <p class="text-gray-300">Fix some nonce N, and assume for notational simplicity that the first q' queries use nonce N, with  <span class="math">q&#x27; \\leq m</span>  by assumption. Then the probability that condition</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We handle condition (C-2) in the following lemma.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof. Fix any two distinct pairs of indices  <span class="math">(i,j) \\neq (i&#x27;,j&#x27;)</span>  such that  <span class="math">N_i \\neq N_{i&#x27;}</span> . If i=i', then necessarily  <span class="math">IV_{i,j} \\neq IV_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;}</span>  by the assumption that the length of any encryption query is at most  <span class="math">|\\mathcal{T}|</span>  blocks of n bits so that counters do not loop, and hence condition (C-2) cannot be fulfilled for this pair of indices. Assume now that  <span class="math">i \\neq i&#x27;</span> . Since  <span class="math">IV_{i,j} = \\operatorname{Inc}^{j-1}(IV_i)</span>  and  <span class="math">IV_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;} = \\operatorname{Inc}^{j&#x27;-1}(IV_{i&#x27;})</span>  where  <span class="math">IV_i</span>  and  <span class="math">IV_{i&#x27;}</span>  are uniformly random and independent, and since  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Inc}</span>  is a cyclic permutation of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{T}</span> , we have that  <span class="math">IV_{i,j} = IV_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;}</span>  with probability  <span class="math">1/|\\mathcal{T}|</span> . Besides, since in the ideal world  <span class="math">C_{i,j}</span>  and  <span class="math">C_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;}</span>  are uniformly random and independent in  <span class="math">\\mathcal{X}</span> , we have that  <span class="math">M_{i,j} \\oplus C_{i,j} = M_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;} \\oplus C_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;}</span>  with probability  <span class="math">1/|\\mathcal{X}|</span> .

From  <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}</span> , we construct two nonce-based keyed functions, PWC[ <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}</span> ] and EPWC[ <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}</span> ], both with key space  <span class="math">\\mathcal{K}</span> , nonce-space  <span class="math">\\mathcal{N} = \\mathcal{X} = \\{0, 1\\}^n</span> , domain  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D} = \\mathcal{A} \\times \\mathcal{M}</span> , where  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A} = \\mathcal{M} = \\{0, 1\\}^*, ^{12}</span>  and range  <span class="math">\\mathcal{Y} = \\mathcal{X} = \\{0, 1\\}^n</span> , as defined in Fig. 3 and illustrated on top of Fig. 1 (for PWC, just omit the final call to  <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}_K^{4,0}</span> ). We will prove that both PWC[ <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}</span> ] and EPWC[ <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}</span> ] are  <span class="math">2^n</span> -secure as nonce-based MAC and nonce-based PRF, and that EPWC[ <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}</span> ] is moreover a birthday bound-secure PRF in the nonce-misuse scenario.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The PWC construction follows the Wegman-Carter paradigm [WC81, Bra82, Sho96] by combining a xor-universal hash function H inspired from PMAC [BR02, Rog04a] applied to (A, M), and a pseudorandom function F applied to the nonce N. This pseudorandom function is constructed from  <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}</span>  by summing two independent pseudorandom permutations in order to obtain security beyond the birthday bound [Luc00]. The EPWC construction is simply PWC with an additional layer of encryption to provide nonce-misuse resistance.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Before stating and proving the security results for (E)PWC, we focus on how to obtain the BBB-secure pseudorandom function F from  <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}</span> . A straightforward way would be to &quot;put the nonce in the tweak&quot;, e.g.,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$F_K&#x27;(N) = \\widetilde{E}_K^{6,N}(0).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This would result in a uniformly random value for each new nonce, but this is only possible when the intended nonce space is smaller than the effective tweak space  <span class="math">\\mathcal{T}</span>  of  <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}</span> . In order to allow the nonce length to be as large as the block length of  <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}</span> , we use instead the &quot;sum-of-PRPs&quot; construction by defining (the exact tweak prefixes are unimportant)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">
<span class="math">$F_K(N) = \\widetilde{E}_K^{2,0}(N) \\oplus \\widetilde{E}_K^{2,1}(N).</span>$
(5)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The pseudorandomness of this construction has been well studied. Assuming that  <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}_K^{2,0}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}_K^{2,1}</span>  are perfectly random and independent permutations, Lucks [Luc00, Theorem 5] showed that an information-theoretic adversary trying to distinguish  <span class="math">F_K</span>  from a random function  <span class="math">\\rho: \\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}^n</span>  within q queries has an advantage upper bounded by  <span class="math">q^3/2^{2n-1}</span>  (see also [CLP14]). Better bounds were proposed in three different papers: Bellare and Impagliazzo [BI99] proved that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;11</sup> We use a set of prefixes which is disjoint from the set used for the CTRT mode in order to later combine the two modes smoothly.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">When constructing an AE scheme, it is more convenient to directly define a vector-input MAC, rather than a string-input MAC that must later be transformed to handle vectors of strings, as required for an AE scheme.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where Z is a value potentially depending on  <span class="math">\\widetilde{P}</span>  for tweaks different from (2, i+1). Since the probability of this equality (over the random draw of  <span class="math">\\widetilde{P}^{2,i+1}</span> ) is either 0 when Z=0 or exactly  <span class="math">1/|\\mathcal{X}|</span>  when  <span class="math">Z\\neq 0</span> , it follows that the condition is met with probability at most  <span class="math">1/|\\mathcal{X}|</span>  in that case. Similarly, if  <span class="math">i=\\ell_a</span> , then (13) is equivalent to</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\widetilde{P}^{2/3,i+1}(A_i(10^*)) \\oplus \\widetilde{P}^{2/3,i+1}(A_i&#x27;(10^*)) = Z,</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where Z is a value potentially depending on  <span class="math">\\widetilde{P}</span>  for tweaks different from (2,i+1) and (3,i+1). Again, the condition is met with probability at most  <span class="math">1/|\\mathcal{X}|</span>  in that case. This concludes the proof that H is xor-universal.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As a second step, we replace  <span class="math">F_{\\widetilde{P}}</span>  by a uniformly random function  <span class="math">\\rho</span>  from  <span class="math">\\mathcal{N}=\\{0,1\\}^n</span>  to  <span class="math">\\mathcal{X}=\\{0,1\\}^n</span> .

(12), except that  <span class="math">F_{\\widetilde{P}}</span>  is replaced by a call to  <span class="math">\\rho</span> . Since A is noncerespecting, then both  <span class="math">\\mathsf{PWC}&#x27;[\\rho,\\widetilde{P}]</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathsf{EPWC}&#x27;[\\rho,\\widetilde{P}]</span>  are perfectly indistinguishable from Rand (this is obvious for  <span class="math">\\mathsf{PWC}&#x27;</span> , while for  <span class="math">\\mathsf{EPWC}&#x27;</span>  this follows from the fact that applying any fixed permutation to uniformly random values yields uniformly random values). Hence, it remains to upper bound A's advantage in distinguishing  <span class="math">(\\mathsf{E})\\mathsf{PWC}[\\widetilde{P}]</span>  from  <span class="math">(\\mathsf{E})\\mathsf{PWC}&#x27;[\\rho,\\widetilde{P}]</span> . By a straightforward hybrid argument, this is exactly the advantage of an adversary A''' simulating H (and  <span class="math">\\widetilde{P}^{4,0}</span>  for  <span class="math">\\mathsf{EPWC}</span> ) in distinguishing  <span class="math">F_{\\widetilde{P}}</span>  from  <span class="math">\\rho</span>  within at most q queries (since each query to the construction translates in exactly one query to the function applied to the nonce). Using Conjecture 1, this advantage is upper bounded by  <span class="math">Cq/|\\mathcal{X}|</span> . Combining this with (6), resp. (7), we obtain the result.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We then prove (b), assuming A is allowed to repeat nonces (m &gt; 1). Exactly as before, one has</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathbf{Adv}^{\\mathrm{PRF}}_{\\mathsf{EPWC}[\\widetilde{E}]}(\\mathsf{A}) \\leq \\mathbf{Adv}^{\\mathrm{TPRP}}_{\\widetilde{E}}(\\mathsf{A}&#x27;&#x27;) + \\delta,</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">with  <span class="math">\\delta</span>  defined as in (8). We now see  <span class="math">\\mathsf{EPWC}[\\widetilde{P}]</span>  as a construction based on a universal hash function applied to (N,A,M) followed by a PRF. More precisely, let</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$H_{\\widetilde{P}}&#x27;(N,A,M)=F_{\\widetilde{P}}(N)\\oplus H_{\\widetilde{P}}(A,M),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">with H and F as defined in resp. (9) and (10). Then</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is easy to adapt the proof that H is xor-universal to show that H' is also xor-universal (hence, in particular, universal, which is all we need here). The remaining of the proof is now standard [Sho04], and we only sketch it.

By the PRP-PRF switching lemma, A can distinguish EPWC[ <span class="math">\\widetilde{P}</span> ] from EPWC&quot;[ <span class="math">\\rho, \\widetilde{P}</span> ] with advantage at most  <span class="math">q^2/(2|\\mathcal{X}|)</span> , and because H' is universal, it can distinguish EPWC&quot;[ <span class="math">\\rho, \\widetilde{P}</span> ] from Rand with advantage at most  <span class="math">q^2/(2|\\mathcal{X}|)</span> . The result follows.</p>

Let Win be the event that B asks a right (verification) query which returns 1. Clearly, B's distinguishing advantage is equal to the probability of event Win when B interacts with  <span class="math">W_1</span> , which we now upper bound. As in the proof of Theorem 2, we first replace all calls to  <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}_K</span>  made by the two oracles in  <span class="math">W_1</span>  by a call to a uniformly random tweakable permutation  <span class="math">\\widetilde{P}</span> , and let (with obvious simplification to the notation)  <span class="math">W_2 = ((\\mathsf{E})\\mathsf{PWC}[\\widetilde{P}],\\mathsf{Ver}_{\\widetilde{P}})</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">where H is defined by (9) and was shown to be xor-universal in the proof of Theorem 2. The classical result on Wegman-Carter MACs [Sho96] applies (the additional encryption layer for EPWC does not modify it), and gives</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This concludes the proof.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 1. While it is in principle possible to save one encryption call in the EPWC construction by keeping the final AD or message block unencrypted as in the standard PMAC construction [BR02, Rog04a], we avoid this to ensure that static AD always gets treated the same, independently of the message. Indeed,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">applying this optimization would result in a construction where the final block of AD should be treated differently depending on whether the message is empty or not. Handling the AD independently of the message allows to precompute</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathsf{auth}&#x27; = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^{\\ell_a-1} \\widetilde{P}^{2,i+1}(A_i) \\oplus \\widetilde{P}^{2/3,\\ell_a+1}(A_{\\ell_a}(10^*))</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and to process the nonce and the message later (in particular, when the AD is static, auth' need not be recomputed each time).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 2. In the nonce-misuse scenario, there is a simple birthday attack against  <span class="math">\\mathsf{EPWC}[\\widetilde{E}]</span>  as soon as the adversary can repeat a single nonce twice. The attack proceeds as follows: simply query  <span class="math">\\mathsf{EPWC}[\\widetilde{E}]_K</span>  for roughly  <span class="math">2^{n/2}</span>  pairs  <span class="math">(N_i, A, M)</span>  with distinct nonces and the same AD and message until a collision occurs on the outputs for two nonces  <span class="math">N_1</span>  and  <span class="math">N_2</span> . Clearly, a collision on the MACs implies that  <span class="math">F_K(N_1) = F_K(N_2)</span>  (where  <span class="math">F_K</span>  is given by (5)). Hence, the adversary can now query  <span class="math">Y = \\mathsf{EPWC}[\\widetilde{E}]_K(N_1, A&#x27;, M&#x27;)</span>  for a new pair  <span class="math">(A&#x27;, M&#x27;) \\neq (A, M)</span> . Then Y is a valid forgery for  <span class="math">(N_2, A&#x27;, M&#x27;)</span> . It remains an open problem to design a nonce-based MAC scheme ensuring graceful degradation of security with the maximal number of nonce repetitions.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">6 The SCT Mode</h2>

      <h3 id="sec-6.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">6.1 The NSIV Construction</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we present the nAE mode SCT and analyze its security. We first describe a generic composition method named NSIV, which defines a nAE scheme from a nonce-based keyed function and an nivE scheme. The NSIV construction results from a small (but important from a security viewpoint) modification to the (generic) SIV construction [RS06]. While in SIV the encryption part is purely IV-based, NSIV relies on a combined nonce- and IV-based encryption (nivE) scheme, the nonce being used as input both to the keyed function and the nivE scheme. This is the only difference with SIV, where the nonce is only given as input to the keyed function.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">More formally, let F be a nonce-based keyed function with key-space  <span class="math">\\mathcal{K}_1</span> , nonce space  <span class="math">\\mathcal{N}</span> , domain  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D} = \\mathcal{A} \\times \\mathcal{M}</span> , and range  <span class="math">\\mathcal{Y}</span> , and  <span class="math">\\Pi = (\\mathcal{K}_2, \\mathcal{N}, \\mathcal{I}\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{M}, \\mathsf{Enc}, \\mathsf{Dec})</span>  be a nivE scheme. Fix a regular function  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Conv}: \\mathcal{Y} \\to \\mathcal{I}\\mathcal{V}</span> . We define the nAE scheme<sup>13</sup>  <span class="math">\\mathsf{NSIV}[F, \\Pi] = (\\mathcal{K}, \\mathcal{N}, \\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{M}, \\mathsf{Enc}, \\mathsf{Dec})</span>  with key-space  <span class="math">\\mathcal{K} = \\mathcal{K}_1 \\times \\mathcal{K}_2</span>  as specified on Fig. 4.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The security of  <span class="math">\\mathsf{NSIV}[F,\\Pi]</span>  is given by Theorem 4 below. We assume that  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A} = \\mathcal{M} = \\{0,1\\}^*</span>  for convenience, but this restriction can be lifted easily. We denote by  <span class="math">t_{\\Pi}(\\sigma)</span>  an upper bound on the time needed for computing  <span class="math">\\Pi</span> .Enc or</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;13</sup> Our formalization of an nAE scheme in Definition 4 assumes that the ciphertext is a binary string, whereas in our description,  <span class="math">\\mathsf{NSIV}[F,\\Pi]</span> . Enc returns a pair  <span class="math">(C,\\mathsf{tag})</span> . We assume some implicit encoding of this pair into a single binary string.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;14</sup> In more details, it is more convenient to prove Theorem 5 by first replacing  <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}_K</span>  by a uniformly random tweakable permutation, and then applying Theorems 1, 2, and 3 for a perfect TBC.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">A Proof of Theorem 4</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">\\widetilde{H} = \\mathsf{NSIV}[F,H]</span>  and let  <span class="math">\\mathsf{A}</span>  be a  <span class="math">(q,m,\\ell,\\sigma,t)</span> -adversary against  <span class="math">\\widetilde{H}</span>  (we do not specify whether  <span class="math">\\mathsf{A}</span>  is nonce-respecting or not yet). We denote</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\begin{split} W_1 &amp;= (\\widetilde{\\varPi}.\\mathsf{Enc}_{K_1,K_2},\\widetilde{\\varPi}.\\mathsf{Dec}_{K_1,K_2}), \\\\ W_4 &amp;= (\\mathsf{Rand},\\mathsf{Rej}) \\end{split}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">the two worlds that A must tell apart, where  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Rand}(N,A,M)</span>  returns a random string of length  <span class="math">|\\widetilde{H}.\\mathsf{Enc}_{K_1,K_2}(N,A,M)|</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Rej}</span>  always returns  <span class="math">\\bot</span> . We introduce intermediate worlds  <span class="math">W_2^{\\mathrm{AE}}</span> ,  <span class="math">W_2^{\\mathrm{nAE}}</span> , and  <span class="math">W_3</span> . As the names suggest,  <span class="math">W_2^{\\mathrm{AE}}</span> , resp.  <span class="math">W_2^{\\mathrm{nAE}}</span> , will be used for nonce-misuse, resp. nonce-respecting adversaries, while  <span class="math">W_3</span>  will be used in both cases. In  <span class="math">W_2^{\\mathrm{AE}}</span> , we replace  <span class="math">F_{K_1}</span>  by a uniformly random function  <span class="math">\\rho: \\mathcal{N} \\times \\mathcal{D} \\to \\mathcal{Y}</span>  in both the encryption and decryption algorithms. Formally, letting  <span class="math">\\widetilde{H}&#x27; = \\mathsf{NSIV}[\\mathsf{Func}(\\mathcal{N} \\times \\mathcal{D}, \\mathcal{Y}), H]</span> , we define</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$W_2^{\\mathrm{AE}} = (\\widetilde{\\varPi}&#x27;.\\mathsf{Enc}_{\\rho,K_2},\\widetilde{\\varPi}&#x27;.\\mathsf{Dec}_{\\rho,K_2}).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In  <span class="math">W_2^{\\text{nAE}}</span> , on the other hand, we replace the decryption algorithm of  <span class="math">W_1</span>  by an always-rejecting oracle, i.e.,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$W_2^{\\mathrm{nAE}} = (\\widetilde{\\varPi}.\\mathsf{Enc}_{K_1,K_2},\\mathsf{Rej}).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, world  <span class="math">W_3</span>  is defined as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$W_3=(\\widetilde{\\varPi}&#x27;.\\mathsf{Enc}_{\\rho,K_2},\\mathsf{Rej}).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We first consider A's advantage in distinguishing  <span class="math">W_3</span>  from  <span class="math">W_4</span> . Let</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\delta_{3,4} = \\left| \\Pr \\left[ \\mathsf{A}^{W_3} = 1 \\right] - \\Pr \\left[ \\mathsf{A}^{W_4} = 1 \\right] \\right|.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Consider the adversary A' against the nivE-security of  <span class="math">\\Pi</span>  working as follows. Let  <span class="math">G \\in \\{\\Pi.\\mathsf{Enc}_{K_2}^\\</span>,\\mathsf{Rand'}}$  be the oracle to which A' has access, where  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Rand&#x27;}(N,M)</span>  returns a random string of length  <span class="math">|\\Pi.\\mathsf{Enc}_{K_2}^\\</span>(N,M)|$ . Adversary A' runs A. When A asks an encryption query (N,A,M), A' queries G(N,M), thereby obtaining an answer (IV,C). It samples uniformly at random tag in the set of preimages  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Conv}^{-1}(IV)</span>  and returns  <span class="math">(C,\\mathsf{tag})</span>  to A. When A asks a decryption query, A' simply answers  <span class="math">\\bot</span> . When A halts and outputs some bit, A' outputs the same bit. Note that independently of whether G is  <span class="math">\\Pi.\\mathsf{Enc}_{K_2}^\\</span>$  or  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Rand&#x27;}</span> , the first element IV in its answers is uniformly random, and hence tag is uniformly random as well since  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Conv}</span>  is regular. It follows that A' perfectly simulates  <span class="math">W_3</span>  when  <span class="math">G = \\Pi.\\mathsf{Enc}_{K_2}^\\</span>$ , and perfectly simulates  <span class="math">W_4</span>  when  <span class="math">G = \\mathsf{Rand&#x27;}</span> . Moreover, it is easy to see that A' is a  <span class="math">(q,m,\\ell,\\sigma,t&#x27;)</span> -adversary. In particular, A' is nonce-respecting iff A is nonce-respecting. Hence,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\delta_{3,4} \\leq \\mathbf{Adv}_{II}^{\\text{nivE}}(\\mathsf{A}&#x27;) \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\delta_{3,4} \\leq \\mathbf{Adv}_{II}^{\\text{ivE}}(\\mathsf{A}&#x27;),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">depending on whether A is nonce-respecting or not.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We now prove part (a) of the theorem, assuming  <span class="math">{\\sf A}</span>  is allowed to repeat nonces. Let</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\delta_{1,2}^{\\mathrm{AE}} = \\left| \\mathrm{Pr} \\left[ \\mathsf{A}^{W_1} = 1 \\right] - \\mathrm{Pr} \\left[ \\mathsf{A}^{W_2^{\\mathrm{AE}}} = 1 \\right] \\right|.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let A&quot; be the following adversary against the PRF-security of F. Denote  <span class="math">G \\in \\{F_{K_1}, \\rho\\}</span>  the oracle to which A&quot; has access. Adversary A&quot; picks a random  <span class="math">K_2 \\leftarrow_{\\</span>} K_2$  and runs A. When A makes an encryption query (N, A, M), or a decryption query  <span class="math">(N, A, C, \\mathsf{tag})</span> , A&quot; simply executes the corresponding code of Fig. 4, replacing all calls to  <span class="math">F_{K_1}</span>  by a call to its oracle G.

    <p class="text-gray-300">For this, we simply apply the H-coefficients technique. See  <span class="math">W_2^{AE}</span>  as the ideal world and  <span class="math">W_3</span>  as the real world in the language of Lemma 1, and define a bad</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that A&quot; may repeat nonces in its oracle queries even when A is nonce-respecting because a nonce-respecting A is allowed to repeat nonces in <em>decryption</em> queries.

Consequently, an attainable transcript  <span class="math">\\tau</span>  is good if it only contains decryption queries that were answered by  <span class="math">\\perp</span> . Since the encryption oracles are exactly the same in worlds  <span class="math">W_2^{AE}</span>  and  <span class="math">W_3</span> , and since the right (decryption) oracle always rejects in world  <span class="math">W_3</span> , it follows that for any good transcript  <span class="math">\\tau</span> ,  <span class="math">\\Pr[\\Theta_{re} = \\tau] \\ge \\Pr[\\Theta_{id} = \\tau]</span> .

Assume first that there was a previous encryption query (N, A, M) that returned (C, tag'). By our assumption that the adversary never asks a decryption query (N, A, C, tag') if a previous encryption query (N, A, M) returned  <span class="math">(C, \\mathsf{tag&#x27;})</span> , one necessarily has  <span class="math">\\mathsf{tag} \\neq \\mathsf{tag&#x27;} = \\rho(N, A, M)</span> , so that the decryption oracle necessarily returns  <span class="math">\\perp</span> . Hence, the adversary is essentially trying to guess a random value  <span class="math">\\rho(N, A, M)</span>  within at most q(N, A, M) trials, where q(N, A, M) is the number of decryption queries of the form (N, A, C, tag)with  <span class="math">C = \\Pi.\\mathsf{Enc}_{K_2}(N,\\mathsf{Conv}(\\mathsf{tag}),M)</span> , something it can achieve with probability at most  <span class="math">q(N, A, M)/|\\mathcal{Y}|</span> . Summing over all possible values of (N, A, M), we obtain that  <span class="math">\\Pr[\\Theta_{id} \\in \\mathsf{BadT}] \\leq q/|\\mathcal{Y}|</span> . Hence, by Lemma 1, we have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The result follows since  <span class="math">\\mathbf{Adv}_{\\widetilde{II}}^{\\mathrm{AE}}(\\mathsf{A}) \\leq \\delta_{1,2}^{\\mathrm{AE}} + \\delta_{2,3}^{\\mathrm{AE}} + \\delta_{3,4}</span> .

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">B Variants of the CTRT Mode</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A Pure Nonce-Based Variant. From CTRT, we can define a purely nonce-based encryption scheme by simply generating the IV in a pseudorandom way from the nonce N. Namely, if  <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}</span>  has tweak space  <span class="math">\\mathcal{T}&#x27; = \\{0,1\\} \\times \\mathcal{T}</span> , then let</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\begin{split} IV &amp;= \\mathsf{Conv}\\big(\\widetilde{E}_K^{(0,0)}(N)\\big), \\\\ C &amp;= \\mathsf{CTRT}[\\widetilde{E}].\\mathsf{Enc}_K(N,IV,M), \\end{split}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where Conv is a regular function from  <span class="math">\\mathcal{X}</span>  to  <span class="math">\\mathcal{IV} = \\mathcal{T}</span> . We denote the resulting mode NCTRT, and it is illustrated in Fig. 5 (gray box). This mode will be useful when defining the online scheme CTPWC in Section C.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Clearly, the NCTRT mode offers no security against an adversary allowed to repeat nonces. Against nonce-respecting adversaries however, this mode enjoys a security bound very close to the one of Theorem 1 (b). The only differences are an increase in the number of oracle queries made by adversary A' (since there is an additional call to  <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}_K</span>  for each encryption query), and the fact that the IV's are not uniformly random any more since they are generated by applying Conv to values  <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}_K^{(0,0)}(N)</span>  drawn (up to replacing  <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}_K^{(0,0)}</span>  by a random permutation) uniformly at random without replacement. The only modification to bring to the proof of Theorem 1 is in Lemma 4 dealing with condition (C-2) defining a bad transcript. Namely, given two pairs of indices (i,j) and (i',j') such that  <span class="math">i \\neq i&#x27;</span> , the probability, over the draw of  <span class="math">IV_i</span>  and  <span class="math">IV_{i&#x27;}</span>  uniformly random and distinct in  <span class="math">\\mathcal{X}</span> , that  <span class="math">IV_{i,j} = IV_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;}</span> , is at most</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\frac{|\\mathcal{X}|/|\\mathcal{T}|}{|\\mathcal{X}|-1},</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One could, of course, replace  <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}_K^{(0,0)}</span>  by a random function in the security proof, but this would require the PRP-PRF switching lemma and one would bump into the birthday bound.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">since each point in  <span class="math">|\\mathcal{T}|</span>  has exactly  <span class="math">|\\mathcal{X}|/|\\mathcal{T}|</span>  preimages by Conv. (If i=i' and  <span class="math">j \\neq j&#x27;</span> , we necessarily have  <span class="math">IV_{i,j} \\neq IV_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;}</span> .) Hence condition (C-2) is satisfied with probability at most</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\frac{\\sigma^2|\\mathcal{X}|/|\\mathcal{T}|}{2|\\mathcal{X}|(|\\mathcal{X}|-1)} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2|\\mathcal{T}|(|\\mathcal{X}|-1)},</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">which is also an upper bound for the advantage of any distinguisher against NCTRT[E] when E is ideal (since condition (C-1) can never be met for a noncerespecting adversary).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 4. A more straightforward way to generate a uniformly random IV for each new nonce would be to put the nonce in the tweak, by letting for example  <span class="math">IV = \\mathsf{Conv}(\\widetilde{E}_K^{(0,N)}(0))</span> . However, this is only possible when the intended nonce space is smaller than the effective tweak space  <span class="math">\\mathcal{T}</span>  of  <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}</span> . Note that, starting from a block cipher with t-bit tweaks, the nonce in that case can be of length at most t-1 bits because of tweak separation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A Pure IV-Based Variant. We can also define a purely IV-based variant of CTRT. For this, rename N in CTRT IV', and assume that both IV and IV'are chosen uniformly at random at each encryption call. Call the resulting mode IVCTRT. The security of this variant can be easily derived by slightly adapting the proof of Theorem 1. The only change is in the definition of bad transcripts, namely conditions (C-1) and (C-2) defining a bad transcript now become:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>(C-1) there exists  <span class="math">(i,j) \\neq (i&#x27;,j&#x27;)</span>  such that  <span class="math">IV_{i,j} = IV_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;}</span>  and  <span class="math">IV_i&#x27; = IV_{i&#x27;}&#x27;</span> ; (C-2) there exists  <span class="math">(i,j) \\neq (i&#x27;,j&#x27;)</span>  such that  <span class="math">IV_{i,j} = IV_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;}</span> ,  <span class="math">IV_i&#x27; \\neq IV_{i&#x27;}&#x27;</span> , and  <span class="math">M_{i,j} \\oplus C_{i,j} = M_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;} \\oplus C_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;}</span> .</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The probability of condition (C-1) is now at most  <span class="math">\\sigma^2/(2|\\mathcal{X}||\\mathcal{T}|)</span> , while the probability of (C-2) is also upper bounded by  <span class="math">\\sigma^2/(2|\\mathcal{X}||\\mathcal{T}|)</span>  as in Lemma 4. Hence, when E is ideal, the advantage of any adversary A against IVCTRT[E] is at most</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\frac{\\sigma^2}{|\\mathcal{X}||\\mathcal{T}|}.</span>$</p>

    <h4 id="sec-misc-1" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><span class="math">\\mathbf{C}</span> The Online CTPWC Mode</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we propose a nonce-based, online AEAD mode called CTPWC (Counter-in-Tweak then Parallel Wegman-Carter). It combines in an &quot;encryptthen-MAC&quot; manner the NCTRT nonce-based encryption mode described in Appendix B and the nonce-based keyed function PWC of Section 5. More precisely, according to the NRS nomenclature [NRS14], it uses the N2 generic composition method: on input (N, A, M), compute  <span class="math">C = \\mathsf{NCTRT}[E]_K(N, M)</span> ,  <span class="math">tag = PWC[\\widetilde{E}]_K(N, A, C)</span> , and return (C, tag). This is illustrated in Fig. 5. The nAE-security of this mode is tightly related to the security (as a nonce-based encryption scheme [NRS14]) of NCTRT and the nPRF- and nMAC-security of PWC given in Theorems 2 and 3. We omit the details.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">    <img src="_page_36_Figure_0.jpeg" alt="" class="my-4 max-w-full" />
</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Fig. 5. The CTPWC mode, using a TBC  <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}</span>  with tweak space  <span class="math">\\{0,\\ldots,5\\} \\times \\mathcal{T}</span>  and domain  <span class="math">\\mathcal{X} = \\{0,1\\}^n</span> . It is obtained by applying the &quot;encrypt-then-MAC&quot; composition method to NCTRT and PWC. We recall that  <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}_K^i(T,X) = \\widetilde{E}_K((i,T),X)</span>  and that  <span class="math">\\widetilde{E}_K^{i,j}</span>  means that prefix i is used when the input block is complete and unpadded, whereas j is used when the input block is incomplete and padded. Function Inc is a cyclic permutation of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{T}</span> , and Conv is a regular function from  <span class="math">\\mathcal{X}</span>  to  <span class="math">\\mathcal{T}</span>  (e.g., truncation when  <span class="math">\\mathcal{X} = \\{0,1\\}^n</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathcal{T} = \\{0,1\\}^w</span>  with  <span class="math">w \\leq n</span> ).</p>

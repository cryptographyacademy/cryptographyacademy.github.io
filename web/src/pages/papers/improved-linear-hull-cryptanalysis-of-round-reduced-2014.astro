      <p class="text-gray-300">SIMON is a family of lightweight block ciphers designed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) that has attracted much attention since its publication in 2013.
In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the properties of linear approximations of the bitwise AND operation with dependent input bits. By using a Mixed-integer Linear Programming based technique presented in Aasicrypt 2014 for automatic search for characteristics, we obtain improved linear characteristics for several versions of the SIMON family. Moreover, by employing a recently published method for automatic enumeration of differential and linear characteristics by Sun et. al., we present an improved linear hull analysis of some versions of the SIMON family, which are the best results for linear cryptanalysis of SIMON published so far.

Specifically, for SIMON$128$, where the number denotes  the block length, a 34-round linear characteristic with correlation $2^{-61}$ is found, which is the longest linear characteristic that can be used in a key-recovery attack for SIMON$128$ published so far. Besides, several linear hulls superior to the best ones known previously are presented as follows: linear hulls for the 13-round SIMON$32$ with potential $2^{-28.99}$ versus previous $2^{-31.69}$, for the 15-round SIMON$48$ with potential $2^{-42.28}$ versus previous $2^{-44.11}$ and linear hulls for the 21-round SIMON$64$ with potential $2^{-60.72}$ versus previous $2^{-62.53}$.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With the growing demands of ciphers for resource-constrained devices, secure lightweight ciphers with low cost have attracted many attentions in recent years. Many lightweight block ciphers are introduced these years, such as PRESENT [1], LBLOCK [2], LED [3], PRIDE [4] and so on.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">SIMON is a family of lightweight block ciphers presented by the U.S. National Security Agency [5] in 2013 with a feistel structure of different versions of block and key lengths, which performs well in hardware and software implementations. By far, SIMON has attracted many cryptanalysis such as differential analysis [6&ndash;10], linear cryptanalysis [11, 12], impossible differential and zero-correlation linear hull cryptanalysis [11, 13].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We focus on the linear cryptanalysis in this paper. Linear cryptanalysis [14] presented by Matsui is an important cryptanalysis method on block ciphers. It aims at finding a linear expression involving bits of plaintexts, &quot;ciphertexts&quot; (including inner states) and subkeys that deviates from a random linear expression. A key recovery attack can then be launched due to this non-randomness. Linear expressions are usually obtained by linear characteristics that consists of masks for each round state and applies the piling-up lemma to concatenate. This method has been extended to linear hull cryptanalysis by Nyberg [15] in 1995 when several linear characteristics with same input and output masks are used. In paper [16, 17], multiple linear cryptanalysis is introduced to reduce the data complexities. But Murphy in paper [18] shows that the statistical assumptions used in paper [16, 17] may not hold. The problem about independence of approximations is solved in paper [19, 20]. After then multidimensional linear cryptanalysis is presented by Hermelin [21]. In 2008, Selcuk in paper [22] presents a ranking method of key candidates with a concept of advantage and a calculation of the success probability with data complexity of Matsui's Algorithm 2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper, we investigate linear characteristics with consideration of dependence of the S-boxes of the bitwise AND operation with dependent input bits. By the methods of automatic enumeration of differential and linear characteristics presented in [8, 9], some improved results about the linear (hull) cryptanalysis are obtained in this paper.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Specifically, the longest linear characteristic known previously for key recovery on SIMON128 shown in paper [12] is a 34-round linear characteristic with correlation 2<sup>&minus;</sup><sup>63</sup> while we present one with correlation 2<sup>&minus;</sup><sup>61</sup> in this paper. Furthermore, the latter can be used to attack SIMON by Matsui's Algorithm 2 with the complexity 2<sup>127</sup> and probability of success 97% according to the calculating method in [22] with 8-bit advantage. Besides, for SIMON32 the best linear hull known previously is a 13-round one with potential 2 <sup>&minus;</sup>31.<sup>69</sup> in [12] while we give one with potential 2 <sup>&minus;</sup>28.<sup>99</sup> in this paper. Moreover, a 15-round linear hull for SIMON48 with potential 2 <sup>&minus;</sup>42.<sup>28</sup> is presented, whereas the 15-round linear hull with potential 2 <sup>&minus;</sup>44.<sup>11</sup> proposed in paper [12] was the previous best result for this version. We also find a 21-round linear hull with potential 2 <sup>&minus;</sup>60.<sup>72</sup> and a 22-round linear hull with potential 2 <sup>&minus;</sup>63.<sup>83</sup> for SIMON64. The previous best linear hull for SIMON64 is a 21-round linear hull with potential 2 <sup>&minus;</sup>62.<sup>53</sup> proposed in [12]. All these linear cryptanalysis of Matsui's Algorithm 2 in this paper has achieved probability of success 97% with 8-bit advantage and are best known results in linear cryptanalysis of SIMON. Besides, the 21-round linear hull can be extended to a longest 29-round attack on SIMON64/128. The previous best</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">cryptanalysis on this version is a 28-round differential cryptanalysis shown in paper [10, 12]. The results of the linear hulls are summarized in Table 1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a brief description of the block cipher SIMON. Section 3 presents a linear cryptanalysis as well as a linear characteristic/hull searching method on SIMON. The improved results with the linear (hull) cryptanalysis are given in Section 4. We finally conclude the paper in Section 5.</p>

All versions of SIMON with corresponding number of rounds are listed in Table 2. Before a further description of SIMON, we give the notations used in the paper.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The round function of SIMON is shown as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We only consider single key cryptanalysis in this paper and thus the key schedule is omitted here. More details on SIMON can be found in paper [5].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A linear approximation of bits in plaintexts, ciphertexts and subkeys is a Boolean function and we use correlation and bias to evaluate it. Let  <span class="math">f: \\mathbb{F}_2^n \\to \\mathbb{F}_2</span>  be a Boolean function. The correlation  <span class="math">\\epsilon_f</span>  of f is defined by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Consider the linear approximation of the function  <span class="math">f_i^N</span>  with two input mask bits and one output mask bit.

Thus, the number of active S-boxes is the sum of the Hamming weights of output masks of the S-box layers for SIMON, where an active S-box means it is with a non-zero output mask.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-3.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.2 Dependence of S-boxes</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As shown in [9], the dependence of active S-boxes should be taken into consideration in linear cryptanalysis. Here we illustrate it by an example.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">with correlation 0 or  <span class="math">\\pm 2^{-1}</span> , instead of  <span class="math">\\pm 2^{-2}</span>  by the piling-up lemma [14]. The invalid application of the piling-up lemma is due to the dependence of the two S-boxes, namely both of them take  <span class="math">L^r[j+8]</span>  as input. We should take the dependence seriously as it may invalidate a linear characteristic by correlation 0. In the following, we scrutinize the relationship between the input variables of active S-boxes and the correlation of the corresponding expression.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Firstly, the input masks  <span class="math">(I_1^r, I_8^r)</span>  of  <span class="math">f^N</span>  determine whether the correlation of an approximation is zero or not.

    <p class="text-gray-300">As presented in Section 3.2, given the masks (I r 1 , I<sup>r</sup> 8 ), O<sup>r</sup> for the S-box layer in one round, a smaller number of variables involved in quadratic terms leads to a bigger absolute value of the correlation of G. In this paper, we want to find the masks that lead to the least number of variables appearing in quadratic terms. To indicate the number of variables in quadratic terms of the linear approximation of f <sup>N</sup> , n new 0-1 variables V r [j] (j &isin; {1, 2, &middot; &middot; &middot; , n}) indicating whether L r [j] exists in the quadratic terms are introduced in each round for SIMON.

    <p class="text-gray-300">To get the minimum number of linearly active S-boxes, the objective function is set to be the sum of all output mask bits of S-box layers in [9]. However, it is the correlation of the linear characteristics that determines the effectiveness of the linear cryptanalysis. Therefore, considering the influence of the dependence of active S-boxes on correlation, we set the objective function to be P r Pn j=1 V r [j].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With the constraints and the objective function defined above, we try to find better linear characteristics and linear hulls for SIMON with Gurobi, a solver for MILP models. The linear characteristics found may has correlation value 0 due to the dependence of active S-boxes. It is imperative to test whether the linear characteristic has correlation 0.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To get linear hulls, we set the input and output mask bits as the ones in a known linear characteristic and get an amount of linear characteristics that form a linear hull.</p>

After getting the correlation in each round, apply the piling-up lemma to obtain the absolute value of the correlation of the whole cipher since S-boxes from different rounds can be seen as independent ones with the effect of round keys. The results are as follows.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-4.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.1 Linear characteristic</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Experiments have been done on SIMON128. A 34-round linear characteristic of SIMON128 with bias 2<sup>&minus;</sup><sup>62</sup> for a key recovery attack has been found. To the best of our knowledge, the best 34-round characteristic of SIMON128 known previously is presented in [12] and has the bias 2<sup>&minus;</sup>64. What is more, all active S-boxes in this characteristic are independent according to our test. Besides, this characteristic of SIMON128 with bias 2<sup>&minus;</sup><sup>62</sup> is the linear characteristic that covers most rounds and simultaneously meets the condition of &delta; &ge; 2 <sup>&minus;</sup>n+2, which indicates that the probability of success for key recovery is 0.997 [22]. The previous best result that satisfies the condition is a 33-round characteristic with bias 2 <sup>&minus;</sup><sup>60</sup> in [12]. The linear mask (separated into left and right parts) is presented in Tables 5 and Table 6 in Appendix.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our characteristic can be used to attack 36-round SIMON128 with data complexity 2<sup>124</sup> and time complexity 2<sup>124</sup> by Matsui's algorithm 1 [14], and can be further extended to attack 43 rounds with data complexity 2<sup>127</sup> with probability of success 0.997 by Matsui's algorithm 2 [14, 22]. The latter is demonstrated in Figure 1 where the 60 bits of subkeys numbered in black need to be guessed and the red font with underline ones not.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For SIMON64, a 18-round linear characteristic with bias 2<sup>&minus;</sup><sup>32</sup> is listed in Table 7 in Appendix.

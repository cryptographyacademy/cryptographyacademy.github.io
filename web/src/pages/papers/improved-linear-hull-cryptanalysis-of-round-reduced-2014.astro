    <p class="text-gray-300">SIMON is a family of lightweight block ciphers designed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) that has attracted much attention since its publication in 2013. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the properties of linear approximations of the bitwise AND operation with dependent input bits. By using a Mixed-integer Linear Programming based technique presented in Aasicrypt 2014 for automatic search for characteristics, we obtain improved linear characteristics for several versions of the SIMON family. Moreover, by employing a recently published method for automatic enumeration of differential and linear characteristics by Sun <em>et. al.</em>, we present an improved linear hull analysis of some versions of the SIMON family, which are the best results for linear cryptanalysis of SIMON published so far.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Specifically, for SIMON128, where the number denotes the block length, a 34-round linear characteristic with correlation <span class="math">2^{-61}</span> is found, which is the longest linear characteristic that can be used in a key-recovery attack for SIMON128 published so far. Besides, several linear hulls superior to the best ones known previously are presented as follows: linear hulls for the 13-round SIMON32 with <em>potential</em> <span class="math">2^{-28.99}</span> versus previous <span class="math">2^{-31.69}</span>, for the 15-round SIMON48 with <em>potential</em> <span class="math">2^{-42.28}</span> versus previous <span class="math">2^{-44.11}</span> and linear hulls for the 21-round SIMON64 with <em>potential</em> <span class="math">2^{-60.72}</span> versus previous <span class="math">2^{-62.53}</span>.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-4" class="text-2xl font-bold">1 Introduction</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With the growing demands of ciphers for resource-constrained devices, secure lightweight ciphers with low cost have attracted many attentions in recent years. Many lightweight block ciphers are introduced these years, such as PRESENT <em>[1]</em>, LBLOCK <em>[2]</em>, LED <em>[3]</em>, PRIDE <em>[4]</em> and so on.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">SIMON is a family of lightweight block ciphers presented by the U.S. National Security Agency <em>[5]</em> in 2013 with a feistel structure of different versions of block and key lengths, which performs well in hardware and software implementations. By far, SIMON has attracted many cryptanalysis such as differential analysis <em>[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]</em>, linear cryptanalysis <em>[11, 12]</em>, impossible differential and zero-correlation linear hull cryptanalysis <em>[11, 13]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We focus on the linear cryptanalysis in this paper. Linear cryptanalysis <em>[14]</em> presented by Matsui is an important cryptanalysis method on block ciphers. It aims at finding a linear expression involving bits of plaintexts, “ciphertexts” (including inner states) and subkeys that deviates from a random linear expression. A key recovery attack can then be launched due to this non-randomness. Linear expressions are usually obtained by linear characteristics that consists of masks for each round state and applies the piling-up lemma to concatenate. This method has been extended to linear hull cryptanalysis by Nyberg <em>[15]</em> in 1995 when several linear characteristics with same input and output masks are used. In paper <em>[16, 17]</em>, multiple linear cryptanalysis is introduced to reduce the data complexities. But Murphy in paper <em>[18]</em> shows that the statistical assumptions used in paper <em>[16, 17]</em> may not hold. The problem about independence of approximations is solved in paper <em>[19, 20]</em>. After then multidimensional linear cryptanalysis is presented by Hermelin <em>[21]</em>. In 2008, Selcuk in paper <em>[22]</em> presents a ranking method of key candidates with a concept of advantage and a calculation of the success probability with data complexity of Matsui’s Algorithm 2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper, we investigate linear characteristics with consideration of dependence of the S-boxes of the bitwise AND operation with dependent input bits. By the methods of automatic enumeration of differential and linear characteristics presented in <em>[8, 9]</em>, some improved results about the linear (hull) cryptanalysis are obtained in this paper.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Specifically, the longest linear characteristic known previously for key recovery on SIMON128 shown in paper <em>[12]</em> is a 34-round linear characteristic with correlation <span class="math">2^{-63}</span> while we present one with correlation <span class="math">2^{-61}</span> in this paper. Furthermore, the latter can be used to attack SIMON by Matsui’s Algorithm 2 with the complexity <span class="math">2^{127}</span> and probability of success 97% according to the calculating method in <em>[22]</em> with 8-bit advantage. Besides, for SIMON32 the best linear hull known previously is a 13-round one with potential <span class="math">2^{-31.69}</span> in <em>[12]</em> while we give one with potential <span class="math">2^{-28.99}</span> in this paper. Moreover, a 15-round linear hull for SIMON48 with potential <span class="math">2^{-42.28}</span> is presented, whereas the 15-round linear hull with potential <span class="math">2^{-44.11}</span> proposed in paper <em>[12]</em> was the previous best result for this version. We also find a 21-round linear hull with potential <span class="math">2^{-60.72}</span> and a 22-round linear hull with potential <span class="math">2^{-63.83}</span> for SIMON64. The previous best linear hull for SIMON64 is a 21-round linear hull with potential <span class="math">2^{-62.53}</span> proposed in <em>[12]</em>. All these linear cryptanalysis of Matsui’s Algorithm 2 in this paper has achieved probability of success 97% with 8-bit advantage and are best known results in linear cryptanalysis of SIMON. Besides, the 21-round linear hull can be extended to a longest 29-round attack on SIMON64/128. The previous best</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As shown in <em>[9]</em>, the dependence of active S-boxes should be taken into consideration in linear cryptanalysis. Here we illustrate it by an example.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">Y^{r}</span> be the output value of the nonlinear function <span class="math">f^{N}</span> in round <span class="math">r</span>, <span class="math">I^{r}_{1}</span> and <span class="math">I^{r}_{8}</span> be the input masks and <span class="math">O^{r}</span> the output mask. Suppose two S-boxes <span class="math">f^{N}_{j}</span> and <span class="math">f^{N}_{j+7}</span> are active in one round, we have a linear approximation</p>

The invalid application of the piling-up lemma is due to the dependence of the two S-boxes, namely both of them take <span class="math">L^{r}[j+8]</span> as input. We should take the dependence seriously as it may invalidate a linear characteristic by correlation 0. In the following, we scrutinize the relationship between the input variables of active S-boxes and the correlation of the corresponding expression.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Firstly, the input masks <span class="math">(I^{r}_{1},I^{r}_{8})</span> of <span class="math">f^{N}</span> determine whether the correlation of an approximation is zero or not. For non-zero cases, the output mask determines the absolute value of the correlation. This property comes from a fact on quadratic Boolean functions as follows.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Automatic search of differential characteristic for bit-oriented block ciphers by Mixed-integer Linear Programming (MILP) modelling was investigated by Sun et al. <em>[8]</em>, which is further extended to automatic search linear characteristic and linear hull in <em>[9]</em>. This kind of methods denotes each mask bit as a 0-1 variable and describes their propagation through the cipher as linear inequalities (constraints) subjected to which an optimized value of number of active S-boxes is returned. Specifically, the MILP model is as follows.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Constraints for linear operation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">These three constraints for linear operation can be directly obtained from paper <em>[9, 2]</em>.</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>For each bitwise XOR operation, <span class="math">(\\alpha_{1},\\alpha_{2})</span> and <span class="math">\\beta</span> denote the input masks and output mask of <span class="math">\\oplus</span>. The constraints of these mask bits are:</li>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>For each branching in the cipher structure, let <span class="math">(\\alpha_{1},\\alpha_{2},\\alpha_{3})</span> denote the masks on three branches. The constraints of the masks are:</li>

    <p class="text-gray-300">\\[ \\begin{cases}\\tau\\geq\\alpha_{1},\\tau\\geq\\alpha_{2},\\tau\\geq\\alpha_{3};\\\\ \\alpha_{1}+\\alpha_{2}+\\alpha_{3}\\geq 2\\tau;\\\\ \\alpha_{1}+\\alpha_{2}+\\alpha_{3}\\leq 2.\\end{cases} \\] (4)</p>

      <li>For operation of left circular shift by i bits, let <span class="math">\\mu=(\\mu[1],\\mu[2],\\cdots,\\mu[n])</span> and <span class="math">\\nu=(\\nu[1],\\nu[2],\\cdots,\\nu[n])</span> be the input and output masks. The constraints of the masks are:</li>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\nu[j]=\\mu[j+i],j\\in\\{1,2,\\cdots,n\\}</span> (5)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Constraints for S-box.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The S-box in SIMON is bitwise AND and to get valid linear characteristics we only allow the active S-boxes with non-zero output masks and inactive S-boxes with all zero masks. This rule can be described as:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">\\[ \\begin{cases}O^{r}[j]\\geq I_{1}^{r}[j],\\\\ O^{r}[j]\\geq I_{8}^{r}[j],\\end{cases} \\] (6)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where the symbols are as mentioned earlier. The constraint (6) also means that the output mask must be non-zero if the input mask is non-zero.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Constraints dealing with dependence of S-boxes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As presented in Section 3.2, given the masks <span class="math">(I_{1}^{r},I_{8}^{r}),O^{r}</span> for the S-box layer in one round, a smaller number of variables involved in quadratic terms leads to a bigger absolute value of the correlation of <span class="math">G</span>. In this paper, we want to find the masks that lead to the least number of variables appearing in quadratic terms. To indicate the number of variables in quadratic terms of the linear approximation of <span class="math">f^{N}</span>, <span class="math">n</span> new 0-1 variables <span class="math">V^{r}[j]</span> (<span class="math">j\\in\\{1,2,\\cdots,n\\}</span>) indicating whether <span class="math">L^{r}[j]</span> exists in the quadratic terms are introduced in each round for SIMON. The constraints are</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">\\[ \\begin{cases}V^{r}[j]\\geq O^{r}[j-1],\\\\ V^{r}[j]\\geq O^{r}[j-8],\\\\ V^{r}[j]\\leq O^{r}[j-1]+O^{r}[j-8].\\end{cases} \\] (7)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Thus, <span class="math">\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{n}V^{r}[j]</span> is the number of variables appearing in quadratic terms of the linear approximation for one round and <span class="math">\\sum\\limits_{r}\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{n}V^{r}[j]</span> is the number of variables appearing in the linear approximation of SIMON. Note that linear characteristics with the same number of active S-boxes may have different correlations due to different cases of dependence of active S-boxes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Objective function.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To get the minimum number of linearly active S-boxes, the objective function is set to be the sum of all output mask bits of S-box layers in <em>[9]</em>. However, it is the correlation of the linear characteristics that determines the effectiveness of the linear cryptanalysis. Therefore, considering the influence of the dependence of active S-boxes on correlation, we set the objective function to be <span class="math">\\sum\\limits_{r}\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{n}V^{r}[j]</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With the constraints and the objective function defined above, we try to find better linear characteristics and linear hulls for SIMON with Gurobi, a solver for MILP models. The linear characteristics found may has correlation value 0 due to the dependence of active S-boxes. It is imperative to test whether the linear characteristic has correlation 0.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Constraints for linear hulls.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To get linear hulls, we set the input and output mask bits as the ones in a known linear characteristic and get an amount of linear characteristics that form a linear hull.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-12" class="text-2xl font-bold">4 Results</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For each linear characteristic, we obtain the accurate absolute value of the correlation of the linear approximation for each round by nonsingular transform method shown in Section 3.2. After getting the correlation in each round, apply the piling-up lemma to obtain the absolute value of the correlation of the whole cipher since S-boxes from different rounds can be seen as independent ones with the effect of round keys. The results are as follows.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-13" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.1 Linear characteristic</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Experiments have been done on SIMON128. A 34-round linear characteristic of SIMON128 with bias <span class="math">2^{-62}</span> for a key recovery attack has been found. To the best of our knowledge, the best 34-round characteristic of SIMON128 known previously is presented in <em>[12]</em> and has the bias <span class="math">2^{-64}</span>. What is more, all active S-boxes in this characteristic are independent according to our test. Besides, this characteristic of SIMON128 with bias <span class="math">2^{-62}</span> is the linear characteristic that covers most rounds and simultaneously meets the condition of <span class="math">\\delta\\geq 2^{-n+2}</span>, which indicates that the probability of success for key recovery is 0.997 <em>[22]</em>. The previous best result that satisfies the condition is a 33-round characteristic with bias <span class="math">2^{-60}</span> in <em>[12]</em>. The linear mask (separated into left and right parts) is presented in Tables 5 and Table 6 in Appendix.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our characteristic can be used to attack 36-round SIMON128 with data complexity <span class="math">2^{124}</span> and time complexity <span class="math">2^{124}</span> by Matsui’s algorithm 1 <em>[14]</em>, and can be further extended to attack 43 rounds with data complexity <span class="math">2^{127}</span> with probability of success 0.997 by Matsui’s algorithm 2 <em>[14, 22]</em>. The latter is demonstrated in Figure 1 where the 60 bits of subkeys numbered in black need to be guessed and the red font with underline ones not.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper, we considered the dependence of S-boxes in the evaluation of correlation of a linear approximation. With a method for automatic enumeration of the differential and linear characteristic, improved results on the linear (hull) cryptanalysis on SIMON were obtained. Simply, the 34-round linear characteristic with correlation  <span class="math">2^{-61}</span>  on SIMON128 presented in this paper is the best linear characteristic as we know. Besides, a 13-round linear hull with potential  <span class="math">2^{-28.99}</span>  for SIMON32, a 15-round linear hull with potential  <span class="math">2^{-42.28}</span>  for SIMON48, a 21-round linear hull with potential  <span class="math">2^{-60.72}</span>  and a 22-round linear hull with potential  <span class="math">2^{-63.83}</span>  for SIMON64 were presented in this paper. All the results of linear cryptanalysis are best. And the 21-round linear hull for SIMON64 can be extended to the longest cryptanalysis of SIMON64.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-2" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Abstract</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper, we derive the probability distributions of difference propagation probabilities and input-output correlations for random functions and block ciphers, for several of them for the first time. We show that these parameters have distributions that are well-studied in the field of probability such as the normal, Poisson, Gamma and extreme value distributions.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For Markov ciphers there exists a solid theory that expresses bounds on the complexity of differential and linear cryptanalysis in terms of average difference propagation probabilities and average correlations, where the average is taken over the keys. The propagation probabilities and correlations exploited in differential and linear cryptanalysis actually depend on the key and hence so does the attack complexity. The theory of Markov ciphers does not make statements on the distributions of these fixed-key properties but rather makes the assumption that their values will be close to the average for the vast majority of keys. This assumption is made explicit in the form of the hypothesis of stochastic equivalence.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper, we study the distributions of propagation properties that are relevant in the resistance of key-alternating ciphers against differential and linear cryptanalysis. Key-alternating ciphers are basically iterative ciphers where round keys are applied by an XOR operation in between unkeyed rounds and are a sub-class of Markov ciphers.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We give the distributions of fixed-key difference propagation probability and fixed-key correlation of iterative ciphers. We show that for key-alternating ciphers, the hypothesis of stochastic equivalence can be discarded. In its place comes the explicit formulation of the distribution of fixed-key differential probability (DP) of a differential in terms of its expected differential probability (EDP) and the distribution of the fixed-key linear probability (or rather potential) (LP) of a linear approximation (or hull) in terms of its expected linear probability (ELP). Here the ELP and EDP are defined by disregarding the key schedule of the block cipher and taking the average over independently selected round keys, instead of over all cipher keys. Proving these distributions requires no assumptions standardly made in Markov cipher theory as perfectly uniform behavior, independently acting rounds or the technique of averaging over keys.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For key-alternating ciphers, we show that if the EDP is equal to 2<sup>−</sup><sup>n</sup> with n the block length, the fixed-key DP has a distribution that is very close to that in a random n-bit cipher. The same holds for the ELP and the corresponding fixed-key LP. Finally we present a technique for computing bounds on the EDP based on the distribution of probabilities of differential characteristics and of the ELP based on the distribution of LP of linear characteristics.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-3" class="text-2xl font-bold">1 Introduction</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Differential and linear cryptanalysis are the two most powerful general purpose cryptographic attacks known to date. In this paper we identify the properties of block ciphers that determine their resistance against these attacks. We make explicit the relations between the identified properties and derive their probability distributions.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-4" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">1.1 Differential and linear cryptanalysis</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In their basic form, both attacks retrieve key information from the last round by analyzing (large) amounts of plaintext/ciphertext pairs. The key information acquired is then used to find even more key bits until the full key is found.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Differential cryptanalysis is a chosen-plaintext attack where plaintexts are applied in pairs that have a fixed difference [5]. The attack exploits the non-uniformity in the distribution of differences in the outputs of a map α, when pairs of inputs with a fixed difference are applied. The non-uniformity exploited can be a differential with a high probability, or, for more advanced versions of the attack, a differential with probability zero, or a combination of differentials with a high probability.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the first type of differential attack, α equals the block cipher. The information on the ciphertext (output) pairs and plaintext (input) pairs is used to derive information on the key (input). If the distribution of output differences has a large peak with value P, the amount of plaintext/ciphertext pairs for the attack to be successful is proportional to P −1 . P is called the differential probability (DP). In the second type of differential attack, α is only a part of the block cipher. The map α is selected in such a way that its inputs and outputs can be computed from the plaintext and ciphertext and a 'small' number of key bits (typically 10 to 20 key bits). As in the first type of attack, the required amount of plaintext/ciphertext pairs is proportional to DP−<sup>1</sup> . In general, DP depends on the key. Hence, the probability of success given a certain amount of plaintext/ciphertext pairs is key-dependent.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Linear cryptanalysis is a known-plaintext attack [20]. It exploits the correlation between linear combinations of input bits and linear combinations of output bits of a non-linear map α. In the first type of linear attack, α equals the block cipher. The information on the ciphertext (output) and the plaintext (input) is used to derive information on the key (input). If the correlation between input and output equals C, the required amount of known plaintexts is proportional to C −2 . In the second type of linear attack, α is only a part of the block cipher. The map α is selected in such a way that its inputs and outputs can be computed from the plaintext and ciphertext and a 'small' number of key bits (typically 10 to 20 key bits). If there is a linear combination of input bits and output bits of α that correlate to zero with a correlation value C while all other linear combinations have a negligible correlation, then it is possible to recover the key bits involved in the computation. In this attack the required amount of known plaintext for the attack to be successful is proportional to C −2 . The quantity C 2 is generally denoted by the term linear probability (or rather potential) (LP). In general, LP depends on the key and hence the probability of success given a certain amount of known plaintext is key-dependent.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Both linear and differential cryptanalysis have been improved with smart techniques that make them more efficient. Moreover, they have been extended in several ways and new attacks have been published that are related to them. The best known extensions are partitioning cryptanalysis [11] and truncated differentials [17]. Other attacks use difference propagation and correlation in different ways. This includes differential-linear attacks [13], impossible differentials [3, 6], boomerang attacks [34] and rectangle attacks [4]. In all these variants, the ability to predict difference propagation probabilities and correlations over multiple rounds that significantly deviate from the average values are essential for their success.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-5" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">1.2 Existing work</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We briefly summarize existing work related to the subject at hand.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-6" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">1.2.1 Markov ciphers</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The Markov cipher theory [18] has inspired many research on iterative block ciphers, including ours. It can be considered as the first approach to design block ciphers resistant against differential cryptanalysis. A Markov cipher is an (iterative) cipher for which the average difference propagation probability over one round is independent of the round's text input. For such ciphers, the assumption of independent round keys allows to compute the average DP of a characteristic as the product of the probabilities of the individual round. Here the average is taken over all the round keys, considered as independent variables. The average DP of a differential can be computed —in principle— as the sum of the probabilities of all characteristics with input difference a in the first round, and output difference b in the last round. Estimating the average probability of a differential to be equal to the fixedkey probability for almost all keys, is called making the hypothesis of stochastic equivalence. After the publication of linear cryptanalysis, Markov cipher theory has been extended to the resistance against linear cryptanalysis (e.g. see [26, 30]), leading to analogous conclusions for the LP of linear approximations (hulls) over the cipher. In [27] Markov theory was used to show that the average DP values in a Markov cipher employing differentially 2-uniform mappings converges exponentially fast to a flat distribution with high probability.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-7" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">1.2.2 Provable security</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In [23, 2], a theory of provable security against differential attacks is developed. Originally developed for Feistel ciphers, the theory has been extended to cover more general Feistel-like constructions in [21]. In [15], the approach is extended further towards SP-networks, and also covers linear cryptanalysis. Follow-up results [16, 28, 29] allow to tighten the bounds for certain designs, using more complex counting strategies. The main contribution of these approaches is the construction of bounds on the average DP of differentials and LP of linear approximations (hulls), with as only condition the assumption of independent round keys.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-8" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">1.2.3 Decorrelation theory</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In [31, 32] the decorrelation theory is proposed as a way to design ciphers secure against linear and differential cryptanalysis. The authors propose to use transformations reminiscent of universal hash functions [33] as an alternate way to have provable upper bounds to EDP and ELP. These transformations are used to construct a decorrelation module which can be plugged in into regular ciphers to make them secure against linear and differential cryptanalysis.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-9" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">1.3 The contributions of this paper</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The complexity of an attack exploiting a differential is determined by the DP of that differential. In general, including Markov ciphers as well as ciphers using decorrelation modules, this quantity depends on the value of the key. The existing theories on cipher design [18, 23, 32] study the DP averaged over all keys assuming independent round keys, denoted by expected DP (EDP). This approximation is known as the hypothesis of stochastic equivalence. The same argument is true for fixed-key and average LP in the context of linear cryptanalysis. Proposed cipher designs upper bound the average value in order to obtain resistance against differential and linear attacks [21].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The problem with this approach is that the average values in general do not allow to draw conclusions on the shape of the distributions of the fixed-key values. In other words, the upper limits proven for the average probabilities do not guarantee that the fixed-key probabilities are small. This has been demonstrated in [1].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the ideal case the distributions of the fixed-key differential and linear properties of a cipher are the same as for random block ciphers. A random block cipher can be modeled as a family of random permutations. For this purpose, we derive in Section 2 the distributions of the typical and maximum DP (or rather cardinality) of differentials over random vector Boolean functions and permutations. Section 3 does the same for the correlations of linear approximations (or hulls) over random vector Boolean functions and permutations. Section 4 treats the cardinalities and LP values in random block ciphers, both for the fixed-key case and for the averages over all keys.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper we consider classes of ciphers that are a subset of Markov ciphers: longkey ciphers and key-alternating ciphers, defined in Section 5. Key-alternating ciphers are basically iterative ciphers where round keys are applied by an XOR operation in between unkeyed rounds. Long-key ciphers are key-alternating ciphers with independent round keys. For long-key ciphers we show in Section 6 that the distribution of the fixed-key probabilities of differentials is determined by the value of the average probability, the EDP. Similarly, in Section 7 we show that the distribution of the fixed-key LP is determined by the value of the average LP over all keys, the ELP. We show that these results remain valid if a key schedule is introduced, i.e. if the long-key cipher is turned into a key-alternating cipher. Hence, for key-alternating ciphers we show that the hypothesis of stochastic equivalence is replaced by the fact that the distribution of the fixed-key DP is determined by the average value of the corresponding long-key cipher. These quantities determine not only the shape of the distributions of the fixed-key quantities, but also the extreme value distribution, i.e. the maxima over all values of the key.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Section 8 we present a method to compute bounds for the EDP over a key-alternating cipher given the distributions of the DP of differential characteristics and for the ELP over a key-alternating cipher given the distributions of the LP of linear characteristics.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our approach differs from that of decorrelation theory in the following way. Decorrelation modules reduce the average DP of differentials, but not the fixed-key DP. In particular, for each value of the key, there is a differential with very high probability. The formal security proofs are based on the fact that since the key is not known, the attacker can not predict which differential has high DP. With our approach, we can avoid altogether the occurrence of differentials with high fixed-key DP, where 'high' means relative to what can be expected for a family of random permutations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Section 10 contains the conclusions, Appendix A lists the probability distributions we</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">encounter in this paper and Appendix B derives the distribution of the maximum of a large number of variables with a given distribution.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-10" class="text-2xl font-bold">2 Differentials in random functions</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we study the distributions related to the DP of differentials in random vector Boolean functions. This serves as a basis for studying the distributions for block ciphers in later sections and can also be used to predict the differential properties of randomly generated S-boxes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A Boolean vector is a vector with bits as coordinates.

    <p class="text-gray-300">A pair is an unordered set of two Boolean vectors of the same dimension: {v, u} = {u, v}. The difference of a pair is a Boolean vector with value u + v, where + denotes the bitwise difference or XOR.

    <p class="text-gray-300">The cardinality of a differential is determined as follows.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Theorem 1 For a random n-bit to m-bit vector Boolean function, the cardinality N(a, b) of a given differential (a, b) is a stochastic variable with a binomial distribution:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof: A random vector Boolean function maps the 2<sup>n</sup> different input values v to independent output values α(v) and hence it maps the differences of pairs {v, u} to independent output differences. Given (a, b), taking a pair with a difference a is an experiment that is successful if the output difference is b. The number of experiments is 2n−<sup>1</sup> and the probability of success is 2−m. The number of successes has the binomial distribution. ut</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Corollary 2 For n ≥ 5 and n − m small , we have:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">\\Pr(N(a,b) = i) \\approx e^{-2^{n-m-1}} \\frac{2^{(n-m-1)i}}{i!} = Poisson(i; 2^{n-m-1})</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof: If n ≥ 5 and n − m is small, then the binomial distribution can be approximated closely by a Poisson distribution with λ = 2n−m−<sup>1</sup> (see Appendix A). ut</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof: For small m, the binomial distribution can be approximated closely by a normal distribution with mean µ(N(a, b)) = 2n−m−<sup>1</sup> and variance σ <sup>2</sup> = 2n−m−<sup>1</sup> (1 − 2 <sup>−</sup>m) (see Appendix A). ut</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In a random permutation, the entries in the definition table of a permutation are not independent from one another. In the series of 2n−<sup>1</sup> experiments of applying the pairs with a given nonzero input difference and observing the output difference, we see that in the output pairs all 2<sup>n</sup> possible output values appear exactly once. This restriction strongly complicates the analysis. Fortunately, the case of permutations was rigorously studied and described in [24, 12]. With the exception of the fact that differentials of the form (a, 0) with a 6= 0 are impossible, it turns out that the probability that a pair with a given input difference maps to a given output difference is not noticeably affected by the fact that the transformation is a permutation. It follows that in the computation of the distribution it is sufficient to replace the probability of success by 1/(2<sup>n</sup> − 1) for nonzero output differences b and by 0 for b = 0. For large n this has a negligible effect on the cardinality of differentials (a, b) with b 6= 0 and hence Corollary 4 for random transformations is also valid for random permutations.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-15" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">2.5 Experimental data</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To verify our approximations, we have generated a large number of random invertible Sboxes ranging from 4 to 8 bits and computed the distribution of the maximum cardinality. Starting from 5 bits the typical shape of extreme value distribution (see Appendix B) becomes apparent. Figure 1 illustrates that already for values as small as 8 the distributions derived in this section are quite close to experimentally obtained data.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-16" class="text-2xl font-bold">3 Correlation in random functions</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we study the distributions of correlation and LP of linear approximations over random vector Boolean functions and permutations. This serves as a basis for studying the distributions for block ciphers in later sections and can also be used to predict the correlation properties of randomly generated S-boxes.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-17" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">3.1 Terminology related to correlation</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A parity of a Boolean vector is a binary Boolean function that consists of the binary addition of a number of its coordinates. A parity is determined by the indices of the bits of the Boolean vector that are included in the binary addition.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The selection vector u of a parity is a Boolean vector that has a 1 in the bit positions that are included in the parity and a 0 in all other positions. Analogously to the inner product of vectors in linear algebra, we express the parity of vector a corresponding with selection vector u as u <sup>T</sup>a. In this expression the T suffix denotes transposition of the vector u.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A (linear) approximation over a vector Boolean function α consists of an n-bit input selection vector v and an m-bit output selection vector u and is denoted by (v, u). What we call a linear rule, is sometimes referred to as a linear approximation. However, we think it makes sense to introduce a new term here, because the term linear approximation is also used to indicate what we call a linear trail (see Section 7.1). An approximation with both the input selection vector and the output selection vector equal to 0 is called a trivial approximation. The imbalance Imb(v, u) of an approximation (v, u) over a function α is the imbalance of the Boolean function given by:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">v^{\\mathrm{T}}a + u^{\\mathrm{T}}\\alpha(a)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The correlation of an approximation is its imbalance divided by 2n−<sup>1</sup> :</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">C(v, u) = \\text{Imb}(v, u)/2^{n-1} = 2^{1-n} \\times \\text{Imb}(v, u)</span>  (17)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The correlation ranges from −1 to +1. A correlation with value −1 means that the parities defined by v and u are each others complement and value +1 means that they are equal. Several authors work with the bias [20]. The bias of an approximation is its correlation divided by two. We prefer to follow here the terminology of e.g. [22] and work with the correlation. Note that the quantity denoted here by correlation, corresponds exactly to the definition of correlation in other fields of mathematics, e.g. probability theory [14].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The linear probability (or rather potential) (LP) of an approximation LP(v, u) is the square of its correlation and ranges from 0 to 1. We call an approximation with zero correlation an impossible approximation. The weight of a possible approximation is the absolute value of the binary logarithm of its LP. The weight ranges between 0 and 2(n − 1). It is well known, see e.g. [7], that for any vector Boolean function and for all u:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">\\sum_{v} LP(v, u) = 1.</span>  (18)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The approximation with output selection vector 0 and input selection vector 0 is the only possible trivial approximation. It has imbalance 2n−<sup>1</sup> , correlation 1 and weight 0. Approximations (v, 0) with v 6= 0 are impossible approximations. For permutations, all approximations (0, u) with u 6= 0 are also impossible approximations. The weight of an approximation over an n-bit permutation ranges from 0 to 2(n − 2) (as the correlation of an approximation over a permutation is an integer multiple of 2n−<sup>2</sup> ). In the remainder of this document we will use the term approximation to mean nontrivial approximation.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-18" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">3.2 Correlation of an approximation over a random vector Boolean function</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We start with a result on the imbalance of an approximation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Theorem 5 For a random n-bit to m-bit vector Boolean function, the imbalance Imb(v, u) of an approximation is a stochastic variable with the following distribution:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\Pr(\\text{Imb}(v, u) = z) = 2^{-2^n} \\binom{2^n}{2^{n-1} + z}.</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof: We start by computing the number of vector Boolean functions for which an approximation (v, u) has imbalance z. For a given Boolean function f, the number of n-bit to m-bit vector Boolean functions α that satisfy</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">v^{\\mathrm{T}}a + u^{\\mathrm{T}}\\alpha(a) = f(a)</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">is independent of the choice of f and is equal to  <span class="math">2^{m2^{n-1}}</span> . So the number of vector Boolean functions that satisfy  <span class="math">\\mathrm{Imb}(v,u)=z</span>  is equal to  <span class="math">2^{m2^{n-1}}</span>  times the number of Boolean functions f(a) with imbalance z. Dividing by the total number of n-bit to m-bit vector Boolean functions results in the given distribution for the imbalance.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Corollary 6</strong> For  <span class="math">n \\geq 5</span> , the result of Theorem 5 can be approximated by:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">\\Pr(\\operatorname{Imb}(v, u) = z) \\approx Z\\left(\\frac{z}{2^{(n-2)/2}}\\right)</span> ,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We first derive the distribution of the imbalance of an approximation over a random n-bit vector Boolean permutation. This distribution was already given in [25] but the proof was missing due to page limit restrictions.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lemma 8 ([25])</strong> For a random n-bit permutation, the imbalance Imb(v, u) of an approximation is a stochastic variable with the following distribution:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\Pr(\\text{Imb}(v, u) = 2x) = \\frac{\\binom{2^{n-1}}{2^{n-2} + x}^2}{\\binom{2^n}{2^{n-1}}}.</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Proof:</strong> We start by computing the fraction of permutations for which an approximation (v, u) has imbalance Imb(v, u) = z. Consider the Boolean function g defined by</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">g(a) = u^{\\mathrm{T}}\\alpha(a). \\tag{19}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Clearly, g(a) is an output parity of  <span class="math">\\alpha</span> . Since  <span class="math">\\alpha</span>  is a permutation, g(a) is balanced. Its definition table contains  <span class="math">2^{n-1}</span>  zeroes and  <span class="math">2^{n-1}</span>  ones.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A vector Boolean permutation for which one output parity has been fixed to a function g can be constructed as follows. Complement the output parity with an (n-1)-bit permutation for the part of the definition table with g(a) = 0 and an (n-1)-bit permutation for the part of</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">the definition table with g(a) = 1. It follows that the number of such vector Boolean permutations is independent from the particular function g(a) and only depends on the dimension n. Hence the fraction of vector Boolean permutations that satisfy Imb(v, u) = z is equal to the number of balanced Boolean functions g that satisfy</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">Imb(g(a) + v^{\\mathrm{T}}a) = z , \\qquad (20)</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">divided by the total number of balanced Boolean functions.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We compute now the number of balanced Boolean functions that satisfy (20). Partition the definition table of g(a) in two halves:  <span class="math">D_0</span>  for which  <span class="math">v^Ta = 0</span>  and  <span class="math">D_1</span>  for which  <span class="math">v^Ta = 1</span> . The total imbalance of  <span class="math">g(a) + v^Ta</span>  is given by the imbalance of g(a) restricted to  <span class="math">D_0</span>  (called x) minus the imbalance of g(a) restricted to  <span class="math">D_1</span>  (called y). As g(a) is balanced, we have x + y = 0 and so y = -x. The imbalance of  <span class="math">g(a) + v^Ta</span>  is hence given by 2x. It follows that in a vector Boolean permutation all approximations have an even imbalance.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The number of balanced Boolean functions g(a) for a given value of x is:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">\\binom{2^{n-1}}{2^{n-2}+x} \\binom{2^{n-1}}{2^{n-2}-x} = \\binom{2^{n-1}}{2^{n-2}+x}^2.</span>  (21)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If we divide this by the total number of balanced Boolean functions, we obtain the probability distribution of the imbalance.  <span class="math">\\Box</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In [25], it is proven that the number of approximations with correlation equal to 0, tends to zero when n grows. Additionally, some upper bounds are derived on the maximum correlation amplitude over all approximations of a random permutation. The distributions for correlations and maximum LP values we derive in the remainder of this section and following sections, confirm these results.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 9</strong> For a random n-bit permutation, with  <span class="math">n \\geq 5</span>  the imbalance  <span class="math">\\mathrm{Imb}(v,u)</span>  of an approximation is a stochastic variable with a distribution that can be approximated as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">\\Pr(\\mathrm{Imb}(v,u)=z) \\approx 2Z\\left(\\frac{z}{2^{(n-2)/2}}\\right)</span> ,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">for z even and zero otherwise.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Proof:</strong> We start with the expression of Lemma 8. If  <span class="math">2^{n-1}</span>  is large, we have:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\binom{2^{n-1}}{2^{n-2} + x} \\approx 2^{2^{n-1}} Z\\left(\\frac{x}{2^{(n-3)/2}}\\right), \\tag{22}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\binom{2^n}{2^{n-1}} \\approx 2^{2^n} \\frac{2^{-(n-2)/2}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\ . \\tag{23}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Working this out yields:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\Pr(\\operatorname{Imb}(v, u) = 2x) \\approx Z\\left(\\frac{x}{2^{(n-4)/2}}\\right). \\tag{24}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Substituting x by z/2 gives the desired distribution.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It follows that the correlation of an approximation over a random permutation and a random transformation are both approximated by a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance  <span class="math">2^{-n}</span> . They differ in the fact that the probability is only non-zero for correlation values that are an integer multiple of  <span class="math">2^{2-n}</span>  for permutations and  <span class="math">2^{1-n}</span>  for transformations.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-20" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">3.4 Maximum LP</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let the cumulative distribution of the LP of an approximation be denoted by Φ(x):</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\Phi(x) = \\Pr(\\operatorname{LP}(v, u) \\le x) . \\tag{25}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For values of x ¿ 1, the distributions Φ(x) for approximations with the same output parity and different input parities can be approximated by independent distributions. We have:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">\\Pr(\\max_{v}(\\text{LP}(v, u) &lt; x) \\approx \\Phi(x)^{2^{n}}.</span> (26)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If Φ(x) is very close to 1, we can approximate this by:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">\\Pr(\\max_{v}(LP(v,u) &lt; x) \\approx e^{-2^{n}(1-\\Phi(x))}</span>  (27)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Again, for values of x ¿ 1, the distributions Φ(x) for approximations with different output parities can be approximated by independent distributions. For the cumulative distribution of the maximum LP of a random vector Boolean function we have:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">\\Pr(\\max_{v,u}(LP(v,u) &lt; x)) \\approx e^{-(2^m - 1)2^n(1 - \\Phi(x))} \\approx e^{-2^{m+n}(1 - \\Phi(x))}.</span>  (28)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If we derive the expressions for permutations instead of transformations, we must replace 2<sup>n</sup> by 2<sup>n</sup> − 1. For large n we can approximate 2<sup>n</sup> − 1 by 2<sup>n</sup> , yielding:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">\\Pr(\\max_{u}(\\text{LP}(v, u) &lt; x) \\approx e^{-2^{n}(1 - \\Phi(x))}</span>  (29)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">\\Pr(\\max_{v,u}(\\text{LP}(v,u) &lt; x) \\approx e^{-2^{2n}(1-\\Phi(x))}.</span>  (30)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Due to the fact that <sup>P</sup> <sup>v</sup> LP(v, u) = 1, all these distributions are 0 for x < 2 −n .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Appendix B we have derived the distributions of the maximum. Their mean and standard deviation depend on the number of approximations the maximum is taken over. If we denote this number by 2<sup>y</sup> , the distribution of the maximum has mean 2−<sup>n</sup> (1.38y−ln(1.38y)) and standard deviation 2.6 × 2 −n .</p>

    <h4 id="sec-21" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">3.5 Experimental data</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We have computed the maximum LP of a large numbers of random permutations. Also here, the typical shape of extreme value distribution (see Appendix B) becomes apparent starting from 5 bits. Figure 2 illustrates that already for an 8-bit permutation our approximations match the experimental data quite closely.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A block cipher B with block length n and key length h is an array of 2<sup>h</sup> vector Boolean permutations operating on n-bit Boolean vectors. Each key value k determines a vector Boolean permutation denoted by B[k]. We also refer to B[k] as a fixed-key (block) cipher. A random block cipher with block length n and key length h is an array of 2<sup>h</sup> n-bit random permutations: one random n-bit permutation for each key value. Equivalently, a random block cipher with block length n and key length h is a block cipher chosen randomly from the set of (2<sup>n</sup> !)2 h possible block ciphers of these dimensions, where each block cipher has an equal probability of being chosen.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Key-alternating (block) ciphers are a class of iterative ciphers in which the round keys are introduced in a particularly simple way.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 2</strong> A key-alternating cipher consists of an alternating sequence of unkeyed rounds and simple bitwise key additions.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 4: Block diagram of a key-alternating cipher.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The key-alternating cipher structure is depicted in Figure 4. Most examples of key-alternating ciphers are ciphers with a Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN) structure. However, it is also possible to present a cipher with a Feistel structure as a key-alternating cipher, on the condition that the F function can be presented as the sequence of a round key addition and an unkeyed function. For DES this is not possible due to the expansion before the key addition and hence DES is not a key-alternating cipher. Figure 5 illustrates the alternative representation for a balanced Feistel cipher. To illustrate the differences between Markov and key-alternating ciphers: DES, IDEA, Twofish, RC5, RC6, Serpent, Square and Rijndael (AES) are all Markov ciphers, but of these only Serpent, Square and Rijndael are key-alternating ciphers.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In order to develop our reasoning, we introduce yet another type of block cipher: long-key ciphers.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Definition 3 A long-key cipher is a key-alternating cipher with a particularly simple key schedule. It has a h = n(r + 1) bit cipher key that consists of the concatenation of the r + 1 round keys.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We call the key schedule of a long-key cipher trivial. Note that a long-key cipher is a special case of a Markov cipher. In particular, it satisfies, by definition, the assumption of independent and random round keys. Note further that we introduce this type of cipher only to explain better in the following sections our extensions to the Markov cipher theory.</p>

A pair that shows the differences of a characteristic is called a pair that follows that characteristic.

    <p class="text-gray-300">A characteristic is a sequence of r differentials  <span class="math">(q^{(j-1)}, q^{(j)})</span> , that each have a weight  <span class="math">w_d(q^{(j-1)}, q^{(j)})</span> .

In a key-alternating cipher, the round functions are unkeyed and hence the weight of the single-round differentials is independent of</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">the key. The addition of the round keys between the rounds has no impact on the DP of single-round differentials. It follows that in a key-alternating cipher, the weight of characteristics is <em>independent</em> of the key, and hence also the key schedule.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The following result has been proven for Markov ciphers in [18] under the assumption of independent round keys. Since a long-key cipher is a Markov cipher with independent round keys, the result applies here as well.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-30" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">6.3 Cardinality of characteristics and differentials over key-alternating ciphers</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We define the long-key cipher associated with a key-alternating cipher by replacing its key schedule by the trivial key schedule. Hence, the set of 2<sup>h</sup> expanded key values produced by the key schedule of the key-alternating cipher are a subset of the set of 2(r+1)<sup>n</sup> key values of the long-key cipher. For a given long-key cipher, the total cardinality of all characteristics is deterministic and easy to compute. It follows that the total cardinalities of its differentials are also deterministic. The distributions of fixed-key and average cardinality of characteristics and differentials in key-alternating ciphers are determined by the average DP of those characteristics and differentials in the associated long-key cipher. This quantity is called the expected differential probability (EDP).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Definition 4 The expected differential probability (EDP) of a characteristic or differential over a key-alternating cipher is the average DP of that characteristic or differential over the associated long-key cipher.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that the EDP can be defined for iterative ciphers that are not key-alternating by taking the average DP over all round keys, ignoring the key schedule [30]. Our definition of EDP makes explicit the assumption of independent round keys that is always made when the EDP of a characteristic or differential is computed. We have:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">EDP(a,b) = \\sum_{Q_{(a,b)}} EDP(Q_{(a,b)}) = \\sum_{Q_{(a,b)}} 2^{-w_d(Q_{(a,b)})}.</span>  (43)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A cipher with independent round keys is its own associated long-key cipher, and hence for such a cipher the EDP equals the average DP. For other ciphers, the equality doesn't need to hold. The following theorems show that for key-alternating ciphers, the difference between the EDP and the average DP is small.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It seems reasonable to make the following assumption.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Assumption 1 (The Sampling Model) The set of pairs that follow a characteristic for a given key can be modeled by a sampling process.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Under this assumption, we can prove the following relation between the EDP and the DP of a characteristic.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Theorem 13 In a key-alternating cipher, the fixed-key cardinality of a characteristic with weight z is a stochastic variable with the following distribution:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where the distribution function measures the probability over all possible values of the key and all possible choices of the key schedule.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof: We start by considering the associated long-key cipher. The total cardinality of a characteristic over a long-key cipher follows directly from Theorem 12. The 2(r+2)n−<sup>1</sup> pairs of the associated long-key cipher are divided uniformly over the keys: 2n−<sup>1</sup> pairs for each value of the expanded key.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For each characteristic Q, the set of pairs following the characteristic for a fixed value of the key can be modeled as the outcome of a sampling of a population. The 'population' consists of all pairs (for all key values) in the long-key cipher, and the set of pairs belonging to the fixed key is the 'sample'. The distribution of the outcome of a sampling process depends on the following parameters:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The size of the total population: the total number of pairs for the associated long-key cipher,  <span class="math">2^{(r+2)n-1}</span> ;</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The number of 'successes' in the population: the number of pairs following the characteristic for the associated long-key cipher,  <span class="math">2^{(r+2)n-1-z}</span> ;</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The sample size: the number of pairs belonging to the fixed key,  <span class="math">2^{n-1}</span> ;</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Sampling theory states that the outcome of the sampling process has a hypergeometric distribution [10]:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The mean of this distribution equals  <span class="math">2^{n-1-z}</span>  and the variance equals</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\frac{2^{(r+2)n-1} - 2^{n-1}}{2^{(r+2)n-1} - 1} 2^{n-1-z} (1 - 2^{-z}) . {45}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This distribution can be approximated by a binomial distribution</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\Pr(N[k](Q) = i) \\approx {2^{n-1} \\choose i} 2^{-zi} (1 - 2^{-z})^{2^{n-1} - i} , \\qquad (46)</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Clearly, if z > n-1, then the characteristic is very likely to have cardinality 0 for a significant fraction of the keys.

    <p class="text-gray-300">In most practical ciphers, the cardinality of characteristics and differentials depends on the value of the key. In this section, we modeled the choice of a particular value for the key as a sampling process in a population formed by the ciphers with keys consisting of independent round keys. Under assumptions standardly made in probability theory, Theorem 13 and Theorem 14, show how in a key-alternating cipher the EDP of characteristics and differentials determines the distribution of the fixed-key cardinalities of characteristics and differentials.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The average DP is the mean value of the distribution of fixed-key DPs of a characteristic or differential over all cipher keys. In most practical ciphers, the number of cipher keys is much smaller than the number of keys consisting of independent round keys. Hence, the fixed-key DPs can be assumed to be independent from one another. Corollary 17 indicates distributions for the average DP of characteristics and differentials that are very narrowly centered around the mean. Hence, in the case of key-alternating ciphers, we can justify the approach of [18, 21, 23] to approximate the average DP by the EDP. A similar conclusion can be drawn for the average DP of a characteristic.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We can describe the fixed-key correlation of a hull over an iterative cipher as the sum of the fixed-key correlation contributions of a number of linear characteristics. A linear characteristic Q through a r-round iterative cipher consists of a sequence of r+1 selection patterns:</p>

It follows that the weight of a linear characteristic is the sum of the weights of its single-round approximations. The weight of a linear characteristic through an iterative cipher for a given key unambiguously determines its LP and hence the amplitude of its correlation. As opposed to the fixed-key cardinality of characteristics, the fixed-key correlation of a linear characteristic is in general easy to compute, both its amplitude and its sign:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For a general iterative cipher, the fixed-key LP (and hence also the weight) of a single-round approximation depends on the value of the round key. Consequently, the weight of linear characteristics depends on the value of the key. For a key-alternating cipher we can prove the following lemma:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Lemma 18 In a key-alternating cipher, the weight z and LP 2 <sup>−</sup><sup>z</sup> of a linear characteristic are independent of the key, and hence also the key schedule.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The ELP can be defined for iterative ciphers that are not key-alternating by taking the average LP over all round keys, ignoring the key schedule [30]. Our definition of ELP makes explicit the assumption of independent round keys that is always made when the ELP of a characteristic or hull is computed. Note that the expected linear probability (ELP) despite its name is neither a probability nor the expected value over a key-alternating cipher unless it is a long-key cipher. We still chose to use the term here because it is well accepted in cryptographic literature. For the ELP we have the following theorem:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 21</strong> The ELP of a hull over a key-alternating cipher ELP(v, u) is the sum of the LP values of all linear characteristics between v and u.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-35" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">7.3 Fixed-key correlation of hulls in long-key ciphers</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The distribution of the fixed-key LP of a hull over a long-key cipher LP<a href="v, u">k</a>, given ELP(v, u) depends on the number of linear characteristics between v and u and the relative size of their LP values. In the extreme case that there is only a single linear characteristic, the fixed-key LP is equal to that of the linear characteristic and is independent of the key. In the case that there are many linear characteristics and for all individual linear characteristics 2 <sup>−</sup>z<sup>i</sup> ¿ ELP(v, u), the correlation C<a href="v, u">k</a> is the sum of many stochastic variables with mean 0 resulting in a Gamma distribution for LP<a href="v, u">k</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the case that the number of linear characteristics is large we can prove the following theorem:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Theorem 22 If the number of linear characteristics between v and u is large, the fixed-key LP of a hull LP<a href="v, u">k</a> over a long-key cipher is a stochastic variable with the following Gamma distribution:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\Pr(\\text{LP}[k](v,u) = z) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\text{ELP}(v,u)}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi z}} \\exp(-\\frac{z}{2\\text{ELP}(v,u)}) \\ ,</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">for z > 0 and 0 otherwise. This distribution is taken over all possible expanded keys. This distribution has mean ELP(v, u) and standard deviation <sup>√</sup> 2 × ELP(v, u).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof: The mean of the fixed-key LP µ(LP<a href="v, u">k</a>) is equal to the variance of the fixed-key correlation σ 2 (C<a href="v, u">k</a>). The fixed-key correlation C<a href="v, u">k</a> is the sum of the (signed) correlations of the linear characteristics Q(v,u) . These correlations are independent as their sign depends on independent parities of the expanded key. It follows that the variance of the fixed-key correlation is equal to the sum of the variances of the correlations of the linear characteristics. The variance of the correlation of a linear characteristic is equal to 2−wl(Q) and hence it follows that:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">\\mu(\\text{LP}<a href="v,u">k</a>) = \\sum_{Q_{(v,u)}} 2^{-\\text{w}_l(Q_{(v,u)})} = \\text{ELP}(v,u) .</span>  (53)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">When the number of linear characteristics is large and the LP of the linear characteristics are small compared to ELP(v, u), a fixed-key correlation C<a href="v, u">k</a> is the sum of many independent variables, leading to a normal distribution around 0. The distribution of the square of a variable with such a normal distribution with variance  <span class="math">\\mathrm{ELP}(v,u)</span>  has the Gamma distribution specified in the theorem.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Thanks to the key-dependent signs of the correlations of the linear characteristics the value LP<a href="v,u">k</a> depends strongly on the key from the moment that more than a few linear characteristics are involved.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This proof is valid for a long-key cipher. In an key-alternating cipher the presence of the key schedule makes that the signs of the correlations of the linear characteristics may no longer be independent. The worst case occurs when in a cipher with a linear key schedule the sign-determining parities of two linear characteristics in the expanded key are reduced to the same parity in the cipher key. In that case the correlations of the two linear characteristics will systematically have the same sign or systematically a different sign for all cipher keys. In that case the sum of the terms  <span class="math">LP(Q_1) + LP(Q_2)</span>  in the computation of ELP(v, u) must be replaced by  <span class="math">(\\sqrt{LP(Q_1)} + \\sqrt{LP(Q_2)})^2</span>  or  <span class="math">(\\sqrt{LP(Q_1)} - \\sqrt{LP(Q_2)})^2</span>  depending on the case. The probability that the worst case actually occurs, is small. As there are  <span class="math">2^h</span>  cipher key parities, the probability that there are linear characteristics with colliding cipher key parities only becomes significant when the number of linear characteristics is of the order  <span class="math">2^{h/2}</span> . In that case the LP values of the contributing linear characteristics are very small with respect to the total ELP value and the effect on ELP(v, u) can be neglected.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Section 4 we have shown that for a random cipher, N<a href="a, b">k</a> has a Poisson distribution with  <span class="math">\\lambda = 1/2</span> . In Theorem 14, we have proven that in a key-alternating cipher, N<a href="a, b">k</a> has a Poisson distribution with  <span class="math">\\lambda = 2^{1-n} \\text{EDP}(a, b)</span> . It follows that the fixed-key cardinality of a differential over a key-alternating cipher with  <span class="math">\\text{EDP}(a, b) = 2^{-n}</span>  has the same distribution as in a random cipher.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Similarly, in Section 4 we have shown that for a random cipher, LP<a href="v,u">k</a> has a Gamma distribution with mean  <span class="math">2^{-n}</span>  and standard deviation  <span class="math">\\sqrt{2} \\times 2^{-n}</span> . In Section 7.3, we have demonstrated that in a key-alternating cipher, LP<a href="v,u">k</a> has a Gamma distribution with mean ELP(v,u) and standard deviation  <span class="math">\\sqrt{2} \\times ELP(v,u)</span>  if there are a large number of linear characteristics  <span class="math">Q_{(v,u)}</span> . It follows that the fixed-key LP of a hull over a key-alternating cipher with  <span class="math">ELP(v,u) = 2^{-n}</span>  and for which there are many linear characteristics has the same distribution as in a random cipher.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Therefore for a key-alternating cipher, the following design goals make sense:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>The EDP of all differentials over the cipher minus two rounds should be close to  <span class="math">2^{-n}</span> .</li>

      <li>The ELP of all hulls over the cipher minus two rounds should be close to  <span class="math">2^{-n}</span>  and the number of linear characteristics  <span class="math">Q_{(v,u)}</span>  should be large for any hull (v,u).</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Section 6.2, we have shown that the EDP of a differential is the sum of the DP values of characteristics and Theorem 21 states that the ELP of a hull is the sum of the LP values of linear characteristics. Now, both for differential and linear characteristics, there are techniques for designing ciphers such that one can prove lower bounds for the weight of characteristics, over a given number of rounds [9]. In this section we show how these bounds allow to make statements on the distributions of the EDP and ELP in the case of key-alternating ciphers.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">More generally, we discuss how information on the weight distribution of the characteristics, can be used to make statements on the number of characteristics, with finite weight and the distributions of the EDP of differentials and the ELP of hulls in key-alternating ciphers.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The results of this section can be seen as a quantitative extension of a fundamental theorem of Markov cipher theory that states that under certain assumptions the average difference propagation probabilities of all differentials converge to  <span class="math">2^{-n}</span>  for all (a,b) as the number of rounds grows and hence one can make a Markov cipher secure against differential attacks by just taking a sufficient number of rounds. This is Theorem 3 from [18]. In the following subsections we derive how fast this convergence is for the EDP and ELP in terms of the weight distribution of characteristics, that depend on the number of rounds.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we describe what can be concluded on the distributions of the EDP and the ELP given a lower bound on the weight of characteristics and linear characteristics respectively. We give the derivation for the EDP only, the derivation for the ELP is identical and gives very similar conclusions.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Assume that we have a key-alternating cipher for which there are no characteristics with weight below n + ω. The term ω is a characteristic weight margin with respect to the block length n: all characteristics have a weight that is above the block length plus the margin. We then have the following corollary that results from Theorem 24 and Theorem 25.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Corollary 29 If n + ω is a lower bound for the weights of the characteristics in a long-key cipher, then</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\sigma(\\text{EDP}(a,b)) \\leq 2^{-n} \\sqrt{\\sum_{z \\geq n+\\omega} t_a(z) 2^{n-z}} \\leq 2^{-n} \\times 2^{-\\omega/2} , \\mu(N_c(a,b)) = \\sum_{z \\geq n+\\omega} t_a(z) 2^{z_{\\min}-n} \\geq 2^{\\omega} .</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It follows that the EDP of almost all differentials (a, b) can be brought arbitrarily close to 2 <sup>−</sup><sup>n</sup> by increasing the number of rounds, thereby increasing ω.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let us now consider the worst case, i.e., the maximum EDP over all differentials (a, b). Corollary 29 does not allow to make statements on this value unless we make assumptions on the shape of the distribution of the EDP over all differentials. If we assume a normal distribution, the maximum EDP over all differentials can be found by applying Appendix B.1. The mean value of the maximum EDP is then upper bounded by:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">2^{-n}(1+\\sqrt{2^{-\\omega}}(1.17\\sqrt{2n})) = 0.5(1+1.65\\sqrt{2^{-\\omega}n}). \\tag{71}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If we require this upper bound to be 1 + ² times 2−<sup>n</sup> we obtain:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\omega = \\frac{\\ln(n) + 1 - 2\\ln(\\epsilon)}{\\ln(2)} \\ . \\tag{72}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For example, if we take ² = 1% we obtain for an 128-bit block cipher ω ≈ 20. For the ELP, lower bounds on the weight of linear characteristics allow similar conclusions.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Please note that one should be careful in assuming a normal distribution in specific cases. For example, a small number of rounds of a cipher with strong diffusion typically has many differentials with DP equal to 0. Such cipher specifics can be taken into account in order to find closer bounds.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-41" class="text-2xl font-bold">10 Conclusions and future work</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper, we have derived the probability distributions of a number of important parameters for random functions and block ciphers, for most of them for the first time. We have shown that these parameters have distributions that are well-studied in the field of probability theory such as the normal, Poisson, Gamma and extreme value distributions. These distributions replace the quantities obtained by averaging over keys and invoking the hypothesis of stochastic equivalence.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We showed how much difference there is between fixed-key cardinality and correlation of linear characteristics and average cardinalities and correlations. As far as we know, there is no other theory for the study of differential and linear cryptanalysis that distinguishes between fixed-key behavior and key-averaged behavior.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We proposed the key-alternating round structure, which has the advantage that the weights of the characteristics, are independent of the value of the key. For ciphers adopting this round structure, we derived bounds on the EDP and ELP as a function of the minimum weights of the characteristics.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The results obtained in this paper can be extended in several ways. Firstly, the results can be applied to a particular cipher in order to compute some practical bounds or to examine the validity of the sampling model. Secondly, application to other sub-classes of (Markov) block ciphers can be considered. Thirdly, more work on the interpretation of the results can be done, e.g. what values for ω are needed to obtain provable resistance against linear and differential attacks. Finally, the theory can be extended to cover explicitly resistance against variants of linear and differential attacks.</p>

This distribution has  <span class="math">\\mu(X) = a + b\\gamma</span>  with  <span class="math">\\gamma \\approx 0.58</span>  and  <span class="math">\\sigma(X) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{6}}b \\approx 1.3b</span> . Clearly, the validity of (79) depends on the quality of the linear approximation of f(x) around (a, 0).</p>

    <h4 id="sec-49" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">B.1 Maximum over X with a normal distribution</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let us first consider the special case for a variable x with a standard normal distribution. We have</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">D(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} Z(u)du . (80)</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For large x, this can be closely approximated by [10, 19]:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">D(x) \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{x}Z(x) = 1 - \\frac{1}{x\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{\\frac{-x^2}{2}}</span>  (81)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">From this we can derive the following expression for f(x):</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">f(x) = -\\ln(\\frac{1}{x}Z(x)) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\ln(2\\pi) + x^2) + \\ln(x) . \\tag{82}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The parameter  <span class="math">a_s</span>  (subscript s for standard) is the solution of</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">a_s = \\sqrt{2\\ln(2)y - \\ln(2\\pi) - 2\\ln(a_s)}</span> , (83)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">which can be solved iteratively, ignoring the rightmost term in the first iteration. The derivative of f(x) is given by:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">x + \\frac{1}{x} \\,, \\tag{84}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">hence</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">b_s = \\frac{a_s}{a_s^2 + 1} \\approx \\frac{1}{a_s} \\ . \\tag{85}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Roughly speaking, the maximum has a distribution with mean  <span class="math">1.17\\sqrt{y}</span>  and standard deviation  <span class="math">1.11/\\sqrt{y}</span> . We can find the values of a and b for any normal distribution with mean  <span class="math">\\mu(X)</span>  and standard deviation  <span class="math">\\sigma</span>  by substituting x by  <span class="math">\\frac{X-\\mu(X)}{\\sigma}</span> . This gives:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">a = \\sigma a_s + \\mu(X) , \\qquad (86)</span></div>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">b = \\sigma b_s . (87)</span></div>

    <h2 id="sec-50" class="text-2xl font-bold">B.2 Maximum over <span class="math">X^2</span> , with X normally distributed</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let us first consider the special case for a variable x with a standard normal distribution. For  <span class="math">z = x^2</span> , we have:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">D(z) = \\int_{-\\sqrt{z}}^{\\sqrt{z}} Z(u) du = 2 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\sqrt{z}} Z(u) du .</span>  (88)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using (81), this gives:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">D(z) \\approx 1 - \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2\\pi z}} e^{\\frac{-z}{2}} , \\qquad (89)</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">yielding</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">f(z) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\ln(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) + z + \\ln(z)) . \\tag{90}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300"> <span class="math">a_s</span>  is the solution of:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">a_s = 2\\ln(2)y - \\ln(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) - \\ln(a_s)</span>  (91)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The derivative of f(z) is given by:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{z}</span> ; (92)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As the function f(z) around  <span class="math">(a_s, f(a_s))</span>  only differs from a linear function by a logarithmic term, this is a particularly good approximation. Roughly speaking, the maximum has a distribution with mean  <span class="math">1.38y - \\ln(1.38y)</span>  and standard deviation 2.6.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We can find the values of a and b for any normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation σ by substituting x by <sup>X</sup> σ . This gives:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">a = \\sigma^2 a_s , (93)</span></div>

    <h4 id="sec-51" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">B.3 Maximum over X with a Poisson distribution</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If the maximum is taken over variables with a Poisson distribution, we must take into account the discrete nature of the latter. We can however obtain expressions for the mean and standard deviation of the maximum if we approximate the Poisson distribution by a continuous function. We can derive an expression for the function f(x) and use it to find the values of a and b. We have:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">\\Phi(i;\\lambda) = \\sum_{x=0}^{i-1} \\text{Poisson}(x;\\lambda) = 1 - \\sum_{x \\ge i} \\text{Poisson}(x;\\lambda) .</span>  (95)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For i À λ, this can be closely approximated by [10, 19]:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">\\Phi(i;\\lambda) \\approx 1 - (1 + \\frac{\\lambda}{i}) \\operatorname{Poisson}(i;\\lambda) \\approx \\operatorname{Poisson}(i;\\lambda) = e^{-\\lambda} \\frac{\\lambda^i}{i!}</span> (96)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If we use the Stirling approximation for the factorial [10, 19], we obtain the following expression for f(i):</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math-block">f(i) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2\\pi) + \\lambda + i\\ln(i) - (1+\\ln(\\lambda))i + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(i) .</span>  (97)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If we now make abstraction of the fact that i must be an integer, we can compute the parameter a by solving:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\ln(2)y = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2\\pi) + \\lambda + i\\ln(i) - (\\ln(\\lambda) + 1)i + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(i) , \\qquad (98)</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">or equivalently:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">i = \\frac{\\ln(2)y - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(2\\pi i) - \\lambda}{\\ln(\\frac{i}{\\lambda}) - 1} , \\qquad (99)</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">which can be solved iteratively. The derivative of f(i) is given by:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\ln(\\frac{i}{\\lambda}) + \\frac{1}{2i} \\ . \\tag{100}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Filling in a and using a À λ, we have:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">b \\approx \\frac{1}{\\ln(\\frac{a}{\\lambda})} \\ . \\tag{101}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It follows that if a is much larger than λ, the standard deviation becomes smaller than 1. Since the distribution of the maximum is discrete, this small value of the standard deviation that the distribution is concentrated at the two integer values near a.</p>`;

      <p class="text-gray-300">In this work we generalize the classical Karatsuba Algorithm (KA) for
polynomial multiplication to (i) polynomials of arbitrary degree and (ii) recursive use. We determine exact complexity expressions for the KA and focus on how to use it with the least number of operations. We develop a rule for the optimum order of steps if the KA is used recursively. We show how the usage of dummy coefficients may improve performance. Finally we provide detailed information on how to use the KA with least cost, and also provide tables that describe the best possible usage of the KA for polynomials up to a degree of 127. Our results are especially useful for efficient implementations of cryptographic and coding schemes over fixed-size fields like $GF(p^m)$.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">1 Introduction</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Multiplying two polynomials efficiently is an important issue in a variety of applications, including signal processing, cryptography and coding theory. The present paper provides a generalization and detailed analysis of the algorithm by Karatsuba [2] to multiply two polynomials which was introduced in 1962. The Karatsuba Algorithm (KA) saves coefficient multiplications at the cost of extra additions compared to the schoolbook or ordinary multiplication method. We consider the KA to be efficient if the total cost of using it is less than the cost of the ordinary method. If we assume that we know the cost ratio between one multiplication and one addition we can decide which method is more efficient.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In order to simplify the problem we assume that the maximum degree of the two polynomials which are multiplied is identical. Knuth [3] gives a brief introduction on how to multiply polynomials in a fast way. He demonstrates an algorithm very similar to the KA which he calls &quot;digital method&quot;, and achieves a complexity of O(n2 &radic; 2 log n log n) for very large polynomials. Another well known fast approach for polynomial multiplication is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). A theoretical upper bound for very large numbers can be shown as O(n log n log log n). A comprehensive survey of different methods to multiply polynomials was given by Bernstein [1]. Assuming that the polynomials represent elements of a Galois Field GF(p <sup>m</sup>) we could use the KA to multiply two elements of the finite field and reduce the resulting polynomial afterwards. Another approach is shown by Lempel, Seroussi and Winograd in [4] and by Winograd in [7]. They demonstrate algorithms which perform a modular multiplication and derive asymptotical lower bounds for these.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">While many algorithms have lower asymptotic complexity than the KA the later one shows better performance for polynomials of small degree as they are used in many applications. In this paper we show in detail how to use the KA in an efficient way, both iteratively and recursively. We provide methods and tables to ease this task, and give a detailed count of the numbers of elementary additions and multiplications needed. We also show that for many polynomials using the KA needs less multiplications and additions than the schoolbook method. The work is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the KA. Section 3 extends the KA for polynomials of arbitrary degree in one iteration, and Section 4 enhances the KA to recursive use. Section 5 describes the complexity of the KA when using it for squaring. Section 6 improves the KA by using dummy coefficients, and Section 7 provides the conclusion.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">2 Preliminaries: Karatsuba Algorithm</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let R be a ring. Let A(x) and B(x) be degree-d polynomials over R. The Karatsuba Algorithm (KA) describes a method to multiply two polynomials with coefficients in R. There are two ways to derive the KA: the Chinese Remainder Theorem [1] and simple algebraic transformations. The KA can easily be applied recursively for polynomials which have 2<sup>i</sup> coefficients. But first we show an example of the schoolbook method.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-2.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2.1 Schoolbook Method</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The usual way to multiply two polynomials is often called the schoolbook method. Consider two degree-d polynomials with n = d + 1 coefficients:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$A(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{d} a_i x^i, \\ B(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{d} b_i x^i</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Then the product C(x) = A(x) B(x) is calculated as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$C(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{d} x^{i} \\cdot \\left(\\sum_{s+t=i; s, t \\ge 0} a_{s} b_{t}\\right) = \\sum_{i=0}^{d} \\sum_{j=0}^{d} a_{i} b_{j} x^{i+j}</span>$
(1)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The polynomial C(x) can be obtained with n <sup>2</sup> multiplications and (n &minus; 1)<sup>2</sup> additions.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-2.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2.2 KA for Degree-1 Polynomials</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The KA for degree-1 polynomials was introduced by Karatsuba in [2]. We will now develop the KA through simple algebraic manipulations. Consider two degree-1 polynomials A(x) and B(x).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$A(x) = a_1 x + a_0, \\ B(x) = b_1 x + b_0</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let D0, D1, D0,<sup>1</sup> be auxiliary variables with</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$D_0 = a_0b_0, D_1 = a_1b_1, D_{0,1} = (a_0 + a_1)(b_0 + b_1)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Then the polynomial C(x) = A(x) B(x) can be calculated in the following way:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$C(x) = D_1 x^2 + (D_{0,1} - D_0 - D_1)x + D_0</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We need four additions and three multiplications to compute C(x). Using the schoolbook method we need four multiplications and one addition, thus we save one multiplication and need three extra additions.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For application in practice, e.g., multi-precision multiplication we are interested in the particular value of the ratio between the cost of one multiplication and one addition for which the KA is efficient. Let r be the ratio between the cost of one multiplication and one addition on a specific implementation platform. Then r = tm/t<sup>a</sup> where t<sup>m</sup> and t<sup>a</sup> denote the cost of one multiplication and one addition, respectively. The cost for the schoolbook method c<sup>s</sup> can be calculated as c<sup>s</sup> = 1t<sup>a</sup> + 4tm. The cost of the KA can be similarly obtained as c<sup>k</sup> = 4t<sup>a</sup> + 3tm. We want to know the ratio r when the cost of the KA is less than for the schoolbook method. Therefore we obtain c<sup>k</sup> &lt; c<sup>s</sup> &hArr; 4t<sup>a</sup> + 3t<sup>m</sup> &lt; 1t<sup>a</sup> + 4t<sup>m</sup> &hArr; 3 &lt; r. If the ratio between the cost of one multiplication and one addition is greater than three it is more efficient to use the KA.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-2.3" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2.3 Recursive KA for Polynomials of Degree 2 <sup>i</sup> &minus; 1</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The KA can be applied in a recursive way as shown in Algorithm 1. This is straightforward for polynomials whose number of coefficients n is a power of 2. To apply the algorithm both polynomials are split into a lower and an upper half.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$A(x) = A_u(x)x^{n/2} + A_l(x), \\ B(x) = B_u(x)x^{n/2} + B_l(x)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">These halfs are used as before, i.e., as if they were coefficients. The algorithm becomes recursive if it is applied again to multiply these polynomial halfs. The next iteration step splits these polynomials again in half. The algorithm eventually terminates after t steps. In the final step the polynomials degenerate into single coefficients. Since every step exactly halves the number of coefficients, the algorithm terminates after t = log<sup>2</sup> n steps. Let #MUL and #ADD be the number of multiplications and additions in the underlying ring. Then the complexity to multiply two polynomials with n coefficients is as follows [6]:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\#\\text{MUL} = n^{\\log_2 3}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\#\\text{ADD} \\le 6n^{\\log_2 3} - 8n + 2</span>$</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">3 One-Iteration KA for Polynomials of Arbitrary Degree</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As mentioned above it is straightforward to apply the KA to polynomials which have 2<sup>i</sup> , i positive integer, coefficients (if i &gt; 1, we apply the KA recursively). However, it is not obvious how to apply the KA to polynomials with a number of coefficients which has the form  <span class="math">2^j</span>  n, with j a non-negative integer and n an odd integer, n &gt; 1. Even though the original trick can be applied j times, the problem of multiplying polynomials with n coefficients remains. In particular if j = 0, i.e., if the number of coefficients is odd, the classical KA cannot be applied in a straight forward manner. We start by giving a simple example. Then a general algorithm is provided, followed by a complexity analysis.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We need 13 additions and 6 multiplications. Using the schoolbook method we needs 4 additions and 9 multiplications. Let us take a look at the ratio r.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">4 Recursive Application of the KA</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We can use the KA in a recursive way to decrease the number of operations. First we show the complexity of a simple extension to the basic recursive KA. Then we show how two polynomials with  <span class="math">n \\cdot m</span>  coefficients can be multiplied using a simple one-step recursion of the KA. We will divide the polynomial into m polynomials each with n coefficients and use the KA for m polynomials, i.e., we consider the original polynomial to have m coefficients. To multiply these, the KA for n coefficients is used in the recursive step. We will write &quot;KA for  <span class="math">n \\cdot m</span> &quot; coefficients to mean that the KA for m coefficients was used on polynomials with n coefficients. These n coefficient polynomials, in turn, are multiplied using the KA for n coefficients. Furthermore we will determine a method to multiply polynomials with  <span class="math">\\prod_{i=1}^{j} n_i</span>  coefficients by recursion.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">this the simple recursive KA. In this case the KA is less efficient than for powers of 2. A lower bound for the number of operations is given by the complexity of the KA for n = 2<sup>i</sup> coefficients as described in Section 2.3.

We obtain the upper bound by empirical tests as #MULup = 1.39 n log<sup>2</sup> 3 . When applying the one-iteration KA for two and three coefficients as basis of the recursion, i.e. when applying the KA for two and three coefficients as final recursion step by adding the recursion basis #MUL<sup>3</sup> = 6, the upper bound improves to #MULup = 1.24 n log<sup>2</sup> 3 .

    <p class="text-gray-300">The KA for degree-1 polynomials needs four additions and three multiplications of degree-2 polynomials. Each multiplication is solved by the KA for degree-2 polynomials for which we need 13 additions and 6 multiplications. The number of additions must be carefully analyzed. In order to determine the auxiliary variables  <span class="math">D_{s,t}</span>  we need two additions of degree-3 polynomials. Two degree-d polynomials can be added by adding all n = d + 1 coefficients. Furthermore two degree-5 polynomials have to be added. Notice that there are some overlaps resulting in four further additions. As an example for the overlaps look at  <span class="math">D_0</span>  and  <span class="math">(D_{0,1} - D_0 - D_1)x^3</span> . The first polynomial has degree-4, the second one degree-7. To determine  <span class="math">c_3</span>  and  <span class="math">c_4</span>  we have to add coefficients from the first and second polynomial. Overall we need 18 multiplications and 59 additions.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For polynomials with 6 coefficients the KA is not unique. Above, we first applied the KA for 2 and then for 3 coefficients. One can also first use the KA for 3 and then for 2 coefficients. The needed operations can be calculated with similar arguments as above. The number of operations for both possibilities are depicted in Table 2. The first example is for the KA for  <span class="math">3 \\cdot 2</span> , meaning that first the KA for 2 polynomials where the coefficients themselves are polynomials with 3 coefficients is used. The second example is the KA for  <span class="math">2 \\cdot 3</span>  in which case the KA is used for polynomials for 3 polynomials where the coefficients themselves are polynomials with 2 coefficients. Notice that the number of multiplications is the same for both approaches. We will see that this is always true.

The KA is applied to the polynomials A(x) and B(x) that are considered to have m coefficients. In the recursive step the KA is applied to the polynomials with n coefficients and merged at the end.

    <p class="text-gray-300">It was shown above that for a sequence <sup>n</sup><sup>i</sup> the KA for <sup>Q</sup> <sup>i</sup> n<sup>i</sup> coefficients is most efficient when n<sup>i</sup> &ge; ni+1. We will now show that it is more efficient to apply the KA recursively than only once. Let k be the non-prime number of coefficients. Since k is not prime it can be written as k = n &middot; m and n, m 6= k. We compare using the KA for k and for n &middot; m coefficients. Since we use the KA recursively proving that the one-step recursion is more efficient than no recursion results immediately in the law to use the KA for the factorization of k with multiple prime factors.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Theorem 2 Let k = Q i pi <sup>e</sup><sup>i</sup> with <sup>p</sup><sup>i</sup> prime. Then the general recursive KA for <sup>Q</sup> i Qe<sup>i</sup> <sup>j</sup>=1 p<sup>i</sup> with p<sup>i</sup> &ge; pi+1 results in the least number of operations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since  <span class="math">m+n \\leq mn</span>  for  <span class="math">n,m \\geq 2</span>  this is true. Now we compare the number of additions.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&#1055;</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This results in a simple rule on how to use the general recursive KA: use the factorization of a number k with multiple prime factors combined with an increasing sequence of steps, i.e., KA for  <span class="math">k = \\prod_{i=1}^{j} n_i</span>  with  <span class="math">n_i \\geq n_{i+1}</span> , e.g.,  <span class="math">2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5</span>  for polynomials with 60 coefficients. However, a number of intermediate results has to be stored due to the recursive nature. This might reduce the efficiency for small-sized polynomials. As we showed in Section 3.3 the threshold value r for the KA to be efficient is always 3 for the one-iteration KA. Since we proved that the recursive KA is more efficient than the one-iteration KA it is obvious that  <span class="math">r \\leq 3</span>  always holds. Appendix A displays the least number of operations needed to multiply two polynomials with the KA for polynomials with  <span class="math">n \\in [2,128]</span>  coefficients. There are two sections. The first one displays numbers for the general recursive KA as described in Section 4.4 while the second one describes numbers for the simple recursive KA as introduced in Section 4.1. The first column &quot;n&quot; displays the number of coefficients of the polynomials. The second column &quot;distribution&quot; displays how to use the KA for n coefficients (as mentioned above these are the prime factors in declining order). The next columns denote the number of multiplications and additions. The following column gives the ratio</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$r = \\frac{\\text{\\#ADD} - (n-1)^2}{n^2 - \\text{\\#MUL}}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If the time ratio r' between a multiplication and an addition on a given platform is larger than this r, then the KA is efficient. Note that very small values occur for values of n which largest prime factor is still small, while negative values for r occur if the KA needs less multiplications and additions than the schoolbook method. The very last column &quot;opt(r)&quot; describes which KA version results in a better value r, i.e., has smaller r. We use this as an indicator for a better performance. One can see that the simple recursive KA often outperforms the general recursive KA, especially when n has not only small prime factors. When the number of coefficients is unknown at implementation time or changes permanently it is wise to use the simple recursive KA since it is more efficient in most cases and easier to implement. There are more variants of the KA that might be considered for a fixed-size polynomial multiplication. For example, instead of using the one-iteration KA for</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">n = 31 coefficients you can use the recursive KA and split the 31 coefficient polynomial into two polynomials of 15 and 16 coefficients, respectively. Alternatively you could split the 31 coefficient polynomial into three parts of 10, 10, and 11 coefficients, respectively. In the next recursion step the polynomials are again split in two or three parts, and so on.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that it might be more efficient to use a combination of the KA and the schoolbook method. For example, take a look at n = 8 with the distribution [2 2 2] in Appendix A. Let us consider a platform with r <sup>0</sup> = 2. Since r <sup>0</sup> &gt; r = 1.38 it is more efficient to use the KA. However the threshold value for n = [2 2] is r = 2.14. Therefore it is most efficient to first use the KA for polynomials with 2 coefficients where the coefficients themselves are polynomials with 4 coefficients. These polynomials are then multiplied by the schoolbook method, and not by the recursive KA.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">5 Squaring with KA</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The KA can be applied to squaring polynomials by simply replacing all the coefficient multiplications by coefficient squarings while keeping the additions. Although there is no special form of a squaring KA there still might be a performance gain compared to the ordinary squaring method which requires n squarings, n(n &minus; 1)/2 multiplications and (n &minus; 1)<sup>2</sup> additions. However, this varies for different platforms and depends on the ratio in time between a squaring and a multiplication. Let ta, t<sup>s</sup> and t<sup>m</sup> be the time for an addition, a squaring and a multiplication, respectively. Let r = tm/t<sup>a</sup> be the ratio between a multiplication and an addition as before, and let c<sup>k</sup> and c<sup>s</sup> be the cost of the KA and schoolbook method, respectively. For the comparison we use the upper bound complexity of the KA as stated in Section 4.1. We obtain</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$c_k &lt; c_s \\Leftrightarrow 1.20n^{\\log_2 3} t_s + 7n^{\\log_2 3} t_a &lt; nt_s + n(n-1)/2t_m + (n-1)^2 t_a</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We want to present the two extreme scenarios. In the first one a squaring comes for free, e.g., as it almost is the case for binary fields. Thus t<sup>s</sup> = 0 such that we obtain</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$r &gt; \\frac{7n^{\\log_2 3} - n^2 + 2n - 1}{(n^2 - n)/2}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let r <sup>0</sup> be the right side term. If r &gt; r<sup>0</sup> then it is efficient to use KA instead of the schoolbook squaring method. For r = 10, i.e. a multiplication takes as long as 10 additions, the Squaring KA outperforms the schoolbook squaring method for n &gt;= 4 if a squaring is for free and a multiplication does not perform faster than an addition. For r = 2, the Squaring KA outperforms the schoolbook method for n &gt;= 24.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The second scenario is the case when a squaring takes as long as a multiplication, i.e., t<sup>s</sup> = tm. Then we obtain</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Again let r <sup>0</sup> be the right side term. In this case, for n &gt;= 3 the KA Squaring outperforms the schoolbook method if r = 10, and for n &gt;= 21 it outperforms the schoolbook method if r = 2. If r = 1, i.e. a multiplication takes as long as an addition, then the KA Squaring outperforms the schoolbook squaring method for n &gt;= 44.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Clearly, if t<sup>s</sup> = a t<sup>m</sup> with 0 &lt; a &lt; 1 then the range where KA Squaring outperforms the schoolbook method are in a similar range as above. Hence, one needs first to consider the ratio r in order to estimate the superior squaring method.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">6 Improvement by Using Dummy Coefficients</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To improve the KA we can use dummy coefficients, i.e. prefix zero coefficients, to reduce the number of operations. In Appendix A we observe that the general recursive KA for 11 coefficients needs more operations than the one for 12. Assume A(x) and B(x) are polynomials with 11 coefficients, i.e., of degree 10. Just by adding a dummy coefficient a<sup>11</sup> and b<sup>11</sup> with a<sup>11</sup> = b<sup>11</sup> = 0 we can reduce the total number of operations from 331 to 275. Furthermore it can be observed that the added coefficients imply that there are some computations in the algorithm which do not need to be done. Whenever  <span class="math">a_{11}</span>  or  <span class="math">b_{11}</span>  occurs in the computation we do not need to compute the result. We will show this for an example for polynomials with 11 coefficients.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">A(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{10} a_i \\cdot x^i</span>  and  <span class="math">B(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{10} b_i \\cdot x^i</span>  be two degree-10 polynomials.

We will apply the KA recursively for polynomials with 12 coefficients (in the sequence 3 - 2 - 2). First we rewrite the polynomials:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$A&#x27;(x) = A_1^{(1)} \\cdot x^6 + A_0^{(1)}, \\ B&#x27;(x) = B_1^{(1)} \\cdot x^6 + B_0^{(1)}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and use the KA for degree-1 polynomials:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$D_0^{(1)} = A_0^{(1)} \\cdot B_0^{(1)}, \\ D_1^{(1)} = A_1^{(1)} \\cdot B_1^{(1)}, \\ D_0^{(1)} = (A_0^{(1)} + A_1^{(1)}) \\cdot (B_0^{(1)} + B_1^{(1)})</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">D_0^{(1)}</span>  and  <span class="math">D_{0,1}^{(1)}</span>  are computed as usual and only the computation of  <span class="math">D_1^{(1)}</span>  saves some operations (note that  <span class="math">D_1^{(1)}</span>  has 10 and not 12 coefficients). Now we compute  <span class="math">D_1^{(1)}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$D_1^{(1)} = A_1^{(1)} \\cdot B_1^{(1)}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the second iteration we divide the polynomials once more</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$A_1^{(1)} = A_1^{(2)} \\cdot x^3 + A_0^{(2)}, \\ B_1^{(1)} = B_1^{(2)} \\cdot x^3 + B_0^{(2)}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and obtain the auxiliary variables:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$D_0^{(2)} = A_0^{(2)} \\cdot B_0^{(2)}, \\ D_1^{(2)} = A_1^{(2)} \\cdot B_1^{(2)}, \\ D_{0,1}^{(2)} = (A_0^{(2)} + A_1^{(2)}) \\cdot (B_0^{(2)} + B_1^{(2)})</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As above,  <span class="math">D_0^{(2)}</span>  and  <span class="math">D_{0,1}^{(2)}</span>  do not change compared to the usual computation. To compute  <span class="math">D_1^{(2)}</span>  we need the KA for 2 coefficients instead of 3. Furthermore we save 2 additions to compute each  <span class="math">D_{0,1}^{(1)}</span>  and  <span class="math">D_{0,1}^{(2)}</span>  because  <span class="math">A_1^{(1)}</span>  and  <span class="math">B_1^{(1)}</span>  have only 5 coefficients,  <span class="math">A_1^{(2)}</span>  and  <span class="math">B_1^{(2)}</span>  only 2. To obtain the result we have to compute</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$D_1^{(1)} = A_1^{(1)} \\cdot B_1^{(1)} = D_1^{(2)} \\cdot x^6 + (D_{0,1}^{(2)} - D_0^{(2)} - D_1^{(2)}) \\cdot x^3 + D_0^{(2)}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since  <span class="math">D_1^{(2)}</span>  has only 4 coefficients instead of 6 we save another 2 additions. To obtain the desired result we compute</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$A&#x27;(x) \\cdot B&#x27;(x) = D_1^{(1)} \\cdot x^{12} + (D_{0,1}^{(1)} - D_0^{(1)} - D_1^{(1)}) \\cdot x^6 + D_0^{(1)}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We save another 2 additions because  <span class="math">D_1^{(1)}</span>  has only 10 coefficients instead of 12. So altogether we derive</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\#MUL&#x27;_{11} = \\#MUL_{12} - \\#MUL_{3} + \\#MUL_{2} = 54 - 6 + 3 = 51</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\#ADD&#x27;_{11} = \\#ADD_{12} - \\#ADD_{3} + \\#ADD_{2} - 4 \\cdot 2 = 221 - 13 + 4 - 8 = 204</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\#MUL&#x27;_{11} + \\#ADD&#x27;_{11} = 51 + 204 = 255</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">compared to</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\#MUL_{11} + \\#ADD_{11} = 331</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">for the general recursive KA.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that computing D<sup>1</sup> (1) by using the KA for 5 coefficients requires the same amount of operations. This simple approach can be enhanced by adding one or more dummy coefficients and using this approach recursively.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Now observe that the number of multiplications is exactly the same as it is for the simple recursive KA for 11 coefficients while the number of additions is slightly less. Without a formal proof we can state that the usage of dummy coefficients combined with the general recursive KA only results in a slight performance gain compared to the simple recursive KA. This is due to the fact that the simple recursive KA for n coefficients always needs less operations than the KA for n + 1 coefficients because of the algorithm's construction. Since the simple recursive KA is more efficient than the general recursive KA we can only expect a slight performance gain.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">7 Concluding Remarks</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this article we demonstrated several recursive algorithms to multiply two arbitrary polynomials by means of the Karatsuba Algorithm. We analyzed the complexity of these algorithms and described how to apply them most efficiently. In most cases the simple recursive KA yields the most efficient computation. By adding dummy coefficients the complexity might be slightly decreased.</p>

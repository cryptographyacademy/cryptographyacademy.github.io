    <p class="text-gray-300">Abstract. This paper proposes new Polynomial IOPs for arithmetic circuits. They rely on the monomial coefficient basis to represent the matrices and vectors arising from the arithmetic constraint satisfaction system, and build on new protocols for establishing the correct computation of linear algebra relations such as matrix-vector products and Hadamard products. Our protocols give rise to concrete proof systems with succinct verification when compiled down with a cryptographic compiler whose role is abstracted away in this paper. Depending only on the compiler, the resulting SNARKs are either transparent or rely on a trusted setup.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (SNARKs) enable a resource-constrained verifier to cryptographically verify the authentic computations of an untrusted prover. The technology is particularly well-suited to the cryptocurrency setting, where participants are typically anonymous, untrusted, and where the success of the network depends on the capability of lightweight nodes to verify the network's consensus (however that is defined). In this setting, there is a large monetary incentive for malicious behavior.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Despite the flurry of rapid related and unrelated developments by diverse parties, two trends are emerging as good practices in this domain.</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>Functional separation in the compilation pipeline. The compilation process for general purpose zero-knowledge proofs is separated into multiple steps with clear boundaries. At the input of this pipeline is a computation, represented either as program source code or as a circuit. A technique called arithmetization turns this computation into a constraint system involving native operations over a finite field. The next step transforms this constraint system into an abstract proof system between two parties, prover P and verifier V, that are interactive Turing machines with access to unrealistic or unrealizable resources such as PCP oracles. These abstract proof systems in this step are called interactive oracle proofs (IOPs) and typically achieve statistical or even perfect security. In the last step, the cryptographic compilation, the unrealistic resources are replaced by cryptographic approximations that achieve the same functionality at the expense of introducing computational hardness assumptions for security.</li>

    </ol>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li><em>Polynomial IOP formalism.</em> The abstract information-theoretical proof system in the step before cryptographic compilation could in principle rely on a variety of unrealistic resources, and build a sound proof system from their mathematical properties. However, for the purpose of establishing soundness, the Schwartz-Zippel lemma is an indispensable tool. The strategy is to reduce the satisfaction of arithmetic constraints arising from the constraint system to series of identities of <em>low-degree polynomials</em>. By evaluating these polynomials in random points, their equality is tested probabilistically. If the left and right hand sides of an equation represent identical polynomials, they are identical everywhere, but if they are unequal they are different <em>almost</em> everywhere. The Schwartz-Zippel lemma provides an exact concrete quantification of the security lost due to this probabilistic approximation. A <em>Polynomial IOP</em> is the abstract proof system tailored to this strategy. In this formalism, the prover sends low degree polynomials to the verifier, and rather than reading the entire list of coefficients, the verifier queries these polynomials in a given point through an oracle interface. The cryptographic compiler uses a <em>polynomial commitment scheme</em> to simulate this unrealistic resource.</li>

    </ol>

    <p class="text-gray-300">These trends are visible in the rise of universal SNARKs with universal and updatable structured reference strings (SRS’s) such as Sonic <em>[11]</em>, PLONK <em>[8]</em>, and Marlin <em>[7]</em>. The common idea here is to use the cryptographic pairing-based mathematics only to realize <em>polynomial commitment scheme</em>, typically the KZG scheme <em>[10]</em>. Since the SRS is used only for the KZG scheme, it is independent of the preceding abstract proof system and the circuit it encodes; this independence is precisely what enables updates to the SRS and its adaptation to any circuit. PLONK and Marlin independently formalize this abstraction and introduce the terms <em>Polynomial Protocol</em> and <em>Algebraic Holographic Proof (AHP)</em>, respectively. This paper adopts the terminology of Bünz <em>et al.</em> <em>[6]</em>, who introduce a new polynomial commitment scheme (and hence a cryptographic compiler) based on groups of unknown order and in the process explore the landscape of protocols it can apply to.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">These trends are <em>also</em> visible in the rise of IOPs based on Reed-Solomon codes <em>[1, 4, 3]</em>. The underlying abstract protocols here are not explicitly Polynomial IOPs. However, their common feature is the reliance on Reed-Solomon codewords as the proof oracles. Since Reed-Solomon codewords are obtained by evaluating polynomials in a domain of points whose cardinality is larger than the polynomials’ degree, these proof oracles uniquely identify the originating low-degree polynomials. As a result, a Reed-Solomon IOP is a Polynomial IOP in disguise.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Despite the spontaneous convergence onto Polynomial IOPs as a useful formalism, there seems to be little agreement about the optimal interface between Polynomial IOPs and the arithmetic constraint systems that they realize. Arithmetic constraint systems typically express constraints using matrix algebra: in terms of vectors, and matrix multiplication, but also <em>Hadamard products</em>, which is a fancy word for the element-wise products of pairs of equal-length vectors. The</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">set of operations that Polynomial IOPs natively offer are somewhat different. As a result, how the Polynomial IOP represents the objects in the arithmetic constraint system and how it simulates the equations that constrain them, are the key questions in the design process of Polynomial IOPs. The various answers to these questions are what set the various Polynomial IOPs for arithmetic circuits apart.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>Marlin and Aurora represent the objects of the arithmetic constraint system as the Reed-Solomon codewords of polynomials. Standard techniques establish the correct computation of a Hadamard product of such codewords. The computation of a linear transform applied to such a codeword is reduced to checking the sum of a related codeword.</li>

      <li>PLONK represents the vector of wire values as the values of a polynomial in a domain of points. A permutation argument establishes the assignment of wires to gates and the standard techniques for Reed-Solomon codewords establish the consistency of inputs and outputs to addition and multiplication gates.</li>

      <li>Sonic represents the vectors of left, right, and output wires of a series of multiplication gates as the coefficient vectors of three polynomials. The consistency of these multiplication gates, and of a linear transform, is established by checking several properties of bivariate polynomials. The paper furthermore explains under which conditions these bivariate polynomials can be simulated with univariate ones.</li>

    </ul>

    <h4 id="sec-3" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Contributions.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper we propose a new Polynomial IOP for arithmetic circuits, called Claymore. Succinct verification is achieved with a trusted pre-processing phase. When compiled with any polynomial commitment scheme, the result is a concrete zk-SNARK with universal updatable structured reference string, or transparent setup, depending only on the nature of the polynomial commitment scheme.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The arithmetic constraint system chosen to represent the arithmetic circuit is the Hadamard Product Relation (HPR), in which the witness consists of three vectors representing the left, right, and output wires of a list of multiplication gates. We note that Sonic realizes a similar constraint satisfaction relation by reducing both the multiplication and linear constraints into one large equation. In Claymore, the multiplication gate consistency and linear consistency are achieved in two separate steps, both of which rely on a collection of subprotocols for linear algebra relations that we develop along the way. The separate steps are later merged as an explicit optimization.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Like Sonic but unlike Marlin and PLONK, Claymore opts for the <em>monomial coefficient basis</em> to represent the vectors of the arithmetic constraint system. DenseClaymore represents the linear transform as a dense matrix in the monomial coefficient basis and this choice results in the smallest number of polynomials in the transcript across all Polynomial IOPs. The price to pay for this brevity is the <span class="math">O(n^{2})</span> scaling of the polynomials’ degree, where <span class="math">n</span> is the size of the circuit.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A question that naturally arises when using this basis, is whether it is also equipped to deal with the sparse linear transformations that typically come from long-winded computations. We answer this question positively by providing methods for dealing with sparse linear algebra relations, culminating in a sparse variant of Claymore. This variant concretely outperforms Marlin and Sonic in terms of the number of polynomials in the transcript. While this number is smaller still for PLONK, one notes that PLONK does not support arbitrary fan-in for linear constraints, whereas Marlin and Claymore (both variants) do.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Additionally, we compare the new and existing Polynomial IOPs both abstractly and concretely. In the abtract comparison we determine how the key performance-driving parameters of the Polynomial IOP evolve as a function of the circuit size. In the concrete comparison, we transform the various Polynomial IOPs with three different cryptographic compilers into concrete zk-SNARKs in order to compare the size of the resulting proofs. In this comparison, all proofs establish the integrity of the same benchmark computation.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-4" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Motivation and applications.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The motivation for this work is chiefly theoretical. We study the interface between arithmetic circuits and Polynomial IOPs in isolation of other constraints and demands. As a result of this focus, our protocol is arguably simpler than other protocols that achieve nominally the same thing. Complexity is the friend of mistakes, and our protocol may therefore be the preferred option for this reason even in circumstances where it is inferior in terms of performance.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The dense variant of Claymore performs extremely well for shallow arithmetic circuits, such as the verification circuits of lattice-based and MQ-based signature schemes, which typically involve operations on large matrices and vectors over a small finite field. As a result, a DenseClaymore-SNARK is an outstanding candidate for achieving post-quantum signature aggregation, or signature schemes with various fancy properties that zero-knowledge proofs enable.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using SNARKs in combination with other cryptographic tools points to a useful property that SNARKs frequently lack — they typically require a finite field with a particular structure, such as a large multiplicative subgroup of smooth order. Marlin and PLONK have this property, while Sonic is defined for arbitrary fields. Using the SNARK in combination with a different cryptosystem that requires an incompatible field, requires the SNARK to simulate the cryptosystem’s field operations using the arithmetic constraint system of the SNARK. In contrast, Claymore (like Sonic) induces no such costly simulation overhead as it works for any large enough finite field.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The protocols proposed here promote simplicity through modularity. However, we observe that once the basic protocol has been composed, there are available optimizations that improve its characteristics at the cost of violating the boundaries between modules. This observation highlights the utility of separating design from optimization considerations. Note that it is only the optimized SparseClaymore protocol that outperforms Marlin in the target metric, number of polynomials. The unoptimized version is inferior in all respects. Furthermore, the proof of zero-knowledge relies on a batching-related optimization that ap</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">plies to both variants of Claymore; without this optimization the proof is tricky and complex. Lastly, the optimizations stand on their own, and can possibly improve other Polynomial IOPs beyond Claymore.</p>

In our context, all witnesses are encoded into oracles, and the prover displays knowledge of them simply by providing the oracles to the verifier. As a result, at our level of abstraction, knowledge soundness follows automatically from soundness.

It relies on the fact that the inner product of the coefficient vectors of <span class="math">f_{\\bm{a}}(X)</span> and <span class="math">f_{\\bm{b}}(X)</span> is the middle coefficient of <span class="math">f_{\\bm{a}}(X)\\cdot X^{\\mathsf{d}}\\cdot f_{\\bm{b}}(X^{-1})</span>, assuming that both <span class="math">f_{\\bm{a}}(X)</span> and <span class="math">f_{\\bm{b}}(X)</span> are of degree <span class="math">\\mathsf{d}</span>. To verify the middle coefficient is indeed the claimed inner product <span class="math">c</span>, <span class="math">\\mathsf{V}</span> needs two polynomials: the left half <span class="math">l(X)</span> and the right half <span class="math">r(X)</span>, both of degree <span class="math">\\mathsf{d}-1</span>. Then the identity <span class="math">f_{\\bm{a}}(X)\\cdot X^{\\mathsf{d}}\\cdot f_{\\bm{b}}(X^{-1})=l(X)+X^{\\mathsf{d}}\\cdot c+X^{\\mathsf{d}+1}\\cdot r(X)</span> cannot hold in more than <span class="math">2\\mathsf{d}</span> points unless <span class="math">c</span> is the correct inner product.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our variant of this protocol achieves the same result with the same number of queries but with one polynomial oracle less. This trade-off induces a doubling of the polynomial’s degree and an increase-by-one in the number of distinct evaluation points. To see how this is achieved, observe that the coefficient on <span class="math">X^{\\mathsf{d}}</span> of the polynomial <span class="math">f_{\\bm{a}}(X)\\cdot X^{\\mathsf{d}}\\cdot f_{\\bm{b}}(X^{-1})-c\\cdot X^{\\mathsf{d}}</span> is zero. The same is true for <span class="math">h(X)=\\bar{h}(X)\\cdot\\gamma^{\\mathsf{d}}-\\bar{h}(\\gamma X)</span> for <em>any</em> <span class="math">\\bar{h}(X)</span> and any <span class="math">\\gamma</span> with a large enough multiplicative order. If <span class="math">f_{\\bm{a}}(X)\\cdot X^{\\mathsf{d}}\\cdot f_{\\bm{b}}(X^{-1})=\\sum_{i=0}^{2\\mathsf{d}}c_{i}X^{i}</span> (with <span class="math">c_{\\mathsf{d}}=c</span>), then <span class="math">\\mathsf{P}</span> can obtain <span class="math">\\bar{h}(X)</span> by setting its <span class="math">i</span>th coefficient to <span class="math">c_{i}/(\\gamma^{\\mathsf{d}}-\\gamma^{i})</span> when <span class="math">i\\neq\\mathsf{d}</span>, or uniformly at random when <span class="math">i=\\mathsf{d}</span>. The verifier <span class="math">\\mathsf{V}</span> tests that the coefficient of <span class="math">X^{\\mathsf{d}}</span> is indeed zero by sampling the left and right hand sides of the polynomial identity</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\bar{h}(X)\\cdot\\gamma^{\\mathsf{d}}-\\bar{h}(\\gamma\\cdot X)=f_{\\bm{a}}(X)\\cdot X^{\\mathsf{d}}\\cdot f_{\\bm{b}}(X^{-1})-c\\cdot X^{\\mathsf{d}}</span> (3)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">in a uniformly random point <span class="math">z\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle\\S}}{{\\leftarrow}}\\mathbb{F}\\backslash\\{0\\}</span>. The multiplicative order of <span class="math">\\gamma</span> must be larger than <span class="math">2\\mathsf{d}</span> for this <span class="math">\\bar{h}(X)</span> to exist; for simplicity set <span class="math">\\gamma</span> to the smallest element that generates <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}\\backslash\\{0\\},\\times</span>.</p>

It can be represented by a triple of functions <span class="math">(\\mathsf{col},\\mathsf{row},\\mathsf{val})</span> via <span class="math">M=\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\\mathbf{e}_{\\mathsf{row}(k)}\\mathbf{e}_{\\mathsf{col}(k)}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\cdot\\mathsf{val}(k)</span>, where <span class="math">\\mathbf{e}_{i}</span> is the <span class="math">i</span>th unit vector, where <span class="math">\\mathsf{row},\\mathsf{col}:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N}</span> indicate the column and row of the <span class="math">k</span>th element, and where <span class="math">\\mathsf{val}:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{F}</span> indicates its value. We detail a protocol to establish that <span class="math">\\mathbf{y}=M\\mathbf{x}</span>. We first explain the steps from a high level point of view.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">From MVP to bivariate polynomial evaluation. A key component of the dense matrix-vector multiplication protocol is the evaluation of <span class="math">(f_{M}(X)\\mod X^{n}-\\alpha)</span> at the point <span class="math">z</span>, where <span class="math">f_{M}(X)</span> is the polynomial associated with the matrix <span class="math">M</span>, i.e., <span class="math">f_{M}(X)=\\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}M_{[i,j]}X^{in+j}</span>. This step can equivalently be interpreted as the evaluation of the bivariate polynomial <span class="math">f_{M}(X,Y)=\\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}M_{[i,j]}X^{i}Y^{j}</span> in the point <span class="math">(\\alpha,z)</span>. In other words, if we can achieve sparse bivariate polynomial evaluation, then we can achieve sparse matrix-vector products.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-25" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">From bivariate polynomials to univariate monomial vectors.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The reduction goes one step further: it is possible to achieve sparse bivariate polynomial evaluation given a procedure that establishes that the vector of coefficients of a dense polynomial is the same as the vector of monomials of a sparse univariate polynomial when evaluated in a given point. To see this, observe that a sparse bivariate polynomial <span class="math">f(X,Y)=\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}c_{k}X^{a_{k}}Y^{b_{k}}</span> can be evaluated in a point <span class="math">(x,y)</span> using the polynomials <span class="math">f_{c}(X)=\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}c_{k}X^{k}</span>, <span class="math">f_{x}(X)=\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}x^{a_{k}}X^{k}</span>, and <span class="math">f_{y}(X)=\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}y^{b_{k}}X^{k}</span>, simply by performing one Hadamard and one InnerProduct subprotocol. This reduction does introduce a problem, namely <span class="math">f_{x}(X)</span> and <span class="math">f_{y}(X)</span> cannot be known before <span class="math">\\mathsf{V}</span> supplies <span class="math">x</span> and <span class="math">y</span>. So how does <span class="math">\\mathsf{P}</span> commit to them, and how does <span class="math">\\mathsf{V}</span> verify that the received oracles match with the commitment?</p>

    <h4 id="sec-26" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">From univariate monomial vector to bit matrix.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let’s focus on <span class="math">f_{x}(X)</span>, as <span class="math">f_{y}(X)</span> proceeds analogously. This polynomial can be represented by a bit matrix <span class="math">B</span>, which takes the value <span class="math">1</span> in cells <span class="math">(a_{k},k)</span> and <span class="math">0</span> elsewhere. Let <span class="math">H</span> denote the largest such <span class="math">a_{k}</span>, i.e., <span class="math">H=\\max_{k}a_{k}</span>. Let furthermore <span class="math">\\mathbf{x}=(x^{0},x,x^{2},\\ldots,x^{H-1})^{\\mathsf{T}}</span>, and <span class="math">\\mathbf{z}=(z^{0},z,z^{2},\\ldots,z^{K-1})^{\\mathsf{T}}</span>. Then <span class="math">B</span> represents the polynomial <span class="math">f_{x}(X)</span> since <span class="math">f_{x}(z)=\\mathbf{x}B\\mathbf{z}</span>.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-27" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">From bit matrix to Lagrange and Vandermonde matrices.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The idea is to decompose the matrix <span class="math">B\\in\\mathbb{F}^{H\\times K}</span> as the product of two matrices, <span class="math">L\\in\\mathbb{F}^{H\\times H}</span> and <span class="math">R\\in\\mathbb{F}^{H\\times K}</span>. Let <span class="math">\\mathcal{H}\\subset\\mathbb{F}</span> be a set of <span class="math">H</span> distinct elements of <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span> and <span class="math">\\varphi:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathcal{H}</span> any mapping from <span class="math">\\{0,\\ldots,H-1\\}</span> to <span class="math">\\mathcal{H}</span>. <span class="math">L</span> is the Lagrange matrix, whose <span class="math">h</span>th row is the coefficient vector of <span class="math">\\mathcal{L}_{h}(X)</span>, which is the Lagrange polynomial taking the value <span class="math">1</span> in <span class="math">\\varphi(h)</span> and <span class="math">0</span> in all other points of <span class="math">\\mathcal{H}</span>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">###</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">R</span> is the Vandermonde matrix, whose rows are the (Hadamard) powers of <span class="math">\\left(\\varphi(a_{k})\\right)_{k=0}^{K-1}</span>. Specifically:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To verify that <span class="math">LR = B</span>, observe that the inner product between <span class="math">L_{[h,:]}</span> and <span class="math">R_{[:,k]}</span> is equal to <span class="math">\\mathcal{L}_h(\\varphi(a_k))</span>. When <span class="math">\\mathsf{V}</span> provides <span class="math">(x,z)</span> hoping to obtain <span class="math">\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathsf{T}}B\\mathbf{z}</span>, <span class="math">\\mathsf{P}</span> will respond with <span class="math">[\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathsf{T}}L]</span> and <span class="math">[R\\mathbf{z}]</span> (in polynomial form), and both proceed to an InnerProduct protocol. We will refer to these vectors as the Lagrange and Vandermonde vectors, respectively. The next question is, how and against what does <span class="math">\\mathsf{V}</span> verify them?</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Verifying the Lagrange vector.</strong> After sending <span class="math">x</span> and receiving the vector (encoded as a polynomial oracle) <span class="math">[\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathsf{T}}L]</span>, <span class="math">\\mathsf{V}</span> sends <span class="math">\\gamma</span> to <span class="math">\\mathsf{P}</span>, who responds with the vector <span class="math">[L\\gamma]</span>, where <span class="math">\\gamma = (1, \\gamma, \\gamma^2, \\ldots, \\gamma^{H-1})^{\\mathsf{T}}</span>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">for every <span class="math">h</span>, <span class="math">\\mathsf{V}</span> can check <span class="math">L\\gamma</span> using a Hadamard subprotocol, assuming that <span class="math">\\mathsf{P}</span> or <span class="math">\\mathsf{I}</span> previously committed to oracles for <span class="math">f_{\\varphi}(X) = \\sum_{h=0}^{H-1} \\varphi(h)X^h</span> and <span class="math">f_{\\mathcal{H}}(X) = \\sum_{h=0}^{H-1} \\left( \\prod_{i \\in \\{0\\ldots H-1\\} \\setminus \\{h\\}} (\\varphi(h) - \\varphi(i)) \\right)^{-1} \\cdot X^h</span>.

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Verifying the Vandermonde Vector.</strong> A similar technique allows <span class="math">\\mathsf{V}</span> to verify the Vandermonde vector.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Batching Lagrange and Vandermonde Vectors. In order to establish the correct evaluation of the bivariate polynomial, the prover must establish the correct production of two univariate monomial vectors. A naive implementation invokes the Lagrange vector and the Vandermonde vector procedure twice. However, it turns out to be possible to merge these two invocations, and save a total of 4 polynomials. We treat this optimization explicitly in Appendix C.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-31" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5.2 The Role of Preprocessing</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The preprocessing phase can be omitted. In this case, <span class="math">\\mathsf{V}</span> must compute <span class="math">f_{M}(X)</span> locally. This task requires <span class="math">O(mn)</span> work, or only <span class="math">O(K)</span> if the matrix <span class="math">M</span> has only <span class="math">K</span> nonzero elements and is represented as such. When this phase is omitted, Claymore should be compared to the Polynomial IOP underlying Aurora <em>[4]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">When used with preprocessing, Claymore achieves fast verification. Specifically, the matrix <span class="math">M</span> which determines the circuit being proved, is processed by the indexer. For long and drawn-out computations, this matrix is typically sparse and the SparseMVP is suitable. However, for short or shallow computations, DenseMVP is the better option. Depending on the choice of MVP protocol, the matching soundness error should be considered.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof. We show how S produces the verifier view for  <span class="math">(\\mathbf{i},\\mathbf{x})</span>  without knowledge of  <span class="math">\\mathbf{w}</span> . In the process, we establish that this view is indistinguishable from that of an authentic protocol execution.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The protocol ZKClaymore consists of an invocation to Hadamard protocol and an invocation to either the dense or sparse variant of MVP. Note that both protocols DenseMVP and SparseMVP consists of:</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>a query to  <span class="math">f_{x}(X)</span>  at uniformly random  <span class="math">\\alpha \\stackrel{\\S}{\\leftarrow} \\mathbb{F} \\backslash \\{0\\}</span> ;</li>

      <li>a protocol invocation (ModReduce in DenseMVP, or SparseBiEval in SparseMVP) with inputs that are independent of  <span class="math">\\mathbf{w}_1, \\mathbf{w}_r, \\mathbf{w}_0</span> ;</li>

      <li>an invocation of InnerProduct on input  <span class="math">f_{1w}(X)</span>  and another polynomial  <span class="math">(r(X)</span>  in DenseMVP or  <span class="math">f_{\\alpha^{\\top}M}(X)</span>  in SparseMVP), denoted by  <span class="math">f_{t}(X)</span>  hereafter, that is also independent of  <span class="math">\\mathbf{w}_1, \\mathbf{w}_r, \\mathbf{w}_0</span> .</li>

    </ol>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since <span class="math">\\mathsf{S}</span> knows <span class="math">M</span> and <span class="math">\\mathbf{x}</span>, <span class="math">\\mathsf{S}</span> can compute all polynomials that do not depend on witnesses honestly, i.e., as the honest <span class="math">\\mathsf{P}</span> would. We therefore restrict attention to polynomials that depend on the witness.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">What remains is to demonstrate how to sample the verifier view for InnerProduct on input <span class="math">f_{1w}(X)</span> and <span class="math">f_t(X)</span>, and for Hadamard on input <span class="math">f_{wl}(X)</span>, <span class="math">f_{wr}(X)</span> and <span class="math">f_{wo}(X)</span>. These two subprotocols contribute two polynomial pairs each to the BatchedInnerProduct protocol. It suffices to sample the verifier view for the BatchedInnerProduct protocol just for these two polynomial pairs, because the remaining pairs are independent of the witness.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We compare both variants of Claymore to some other Polynomial IOPs from the literature, namely Sonic, PLONK, Marlin, and Aurora. Of these Polynomial IOPs, the first three give rise to SNARKs after cryptographic compilation. In contrast, Aurora gives rise to a proof system generating short proofs but whose verifier complexity is linear in the size of the witness. Importantly, Claymore is comparable to both types of proof system: with preprocessing, it gives rise to a SNARK; when preprocessing is omitted, the proofs remain short at the expense of linear verifier complexity.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 1 contains an overview of the comparison. It considers the following key performance indicators for Polynomial IOPs.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>The number of polynomials sent by I during the offline preprocessing phase. This number determines the size of the universal or structured reference strings. While this number contributes to the complexity of I, this complexity is generally speaking not a make or break factor.</li>

      <li>The number of polynomials sent by  <span class="math">\\mathsf{P}</span>  during the online proving phase. This number contributes to the size of the proof and to the complexity of both  <span class="math">\\mathsf{P}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathsf{V}</span> .</li>

      <li>The number of evaluations. This number contributes to the size of the proof, as well as indirectly to the complexity of  <span class="math">\\mathsf{P}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathsf{V}</span> .</li>

      <li>The number of distinct points for evaluation. Some cryptographic compilers (e.g., [6]) enable the merger of two polynomial evaluations provided that they are being evaluated in the same point. This number limits the number of times this optimization can be applied.</li>

      <li>The maximum degree of all polynomials. This number contributes to indexer and prover complexity in two ways. First, before cryptographic compilation, I and P operate on polynomials of this degree and their complexity is affected accordingly. The exception is if the polynomials are sparse, or otherwise exhibit a structure that enables fast computation. Second, some cryptographic compilers induce overheads that are superlinear in this degree.</li>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For Sonic,  <span class="math">n</span>  refers to the number of multiplication gates and the degree of the largest polynomial is  <span class="math">7n</span> . However, due to their technique for simulating bivariate polynomials, the addition gates have fan-in bounded by a parameter  <span class="math">M</span> , corresponding to having at most  <span class="math">M</span>  nonzero elements in every row of the linear transform matrix. The same bound applies to the number of nonzero elements in every column. As a result of converting the original circuit into one with this property, a number of multiplication gates may have to be added, thus explaining the Landau notation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For PLONK,  <span class="math">n</span>  refers to the number of multiplication gates and  <span class="math">a</span>  refers to the number of addition gates, all of which have fan-in 2. We note that there is a variant of PLONK with larger proofs and smaller prover time, which is not shown in the table.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Aurora does not have a preprocessing phase and as a result the verifier’s complexity is linear in the number of nonzero elements in the matrices <span class="math">A,B,C</span> from the R1CS tuple. Marlin uses the same mechanics but uses preprocessing to shrink the verifier’s workload for the matrix multiplication; this technique requires 9 polynomials in the uniform or structured reference string (3 per matrix) and a few more in the online protocol. The parameter <span class="math">k</span> denotes the largest number of nonzero elements of <span class="math">\\{A,B,C\\}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For Claymore the linear transform is either represented densely as an <span class="math">m\\times n</span> matrix, or sparsely as a list of <span class="math">K</span> nonzero coefficients in this matrix.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Marlin, PLONK, and Aurora work in the Reed-Solomon codeword basis and crucially rely on the structure of the field or of its multiplicative group. In contrast, Sonic and Claymore work for any field.</p>

The set holds 1024 elements and its Merkle root is known, as is the member element. The witness consists of the element’s position in the tree, and the authentication path. The Merkle tree is constructed using the zero-knowledge-proof-friendly Rescue-Prime hash function <em>[12]</em> with <span class="math">m=3</span> state elements, rate equal to <span class="math">r=2</span>, over a prime field with <span class="math">p&gt;2^{256}</span> elements, with <span class="math">N=18</span> rounds, targeting a security level of <span class="math">\\lambda=128</span> bits against collisions.</p>

The FRI protocol establishes the bounded degree by opening Merkle leafs. As a result, the technique for dividing out the zerofier applies even without supplying a new commitment.

    <p class="text-gray-300">The modular approach followed in this paper admits a piece by piece presentation and analysis that benefits simplicity and accessibility. Nevertheless, some optimizations violate the boundaries implicit in this modular structure. These optimizations are of independent interest as they may also apply elsewhere; perhaps they have straightforward analogues in the Reed-Solomon codeword domain. Some of the more important optimizations are summarized as follows.</p>

      <li>In some cases it is possible to eliminate polynomials. In particular, when a polynomial is queried exactly twice and is involved in exactly two polynomial identities. By moving this polynomial to the left hand side, and equating the right hand sides, the polynomial identities are merged and the polynomial in question is eliminated, all without impacting soundness.</li>

      <li>After unrolling a Polynomial IOP, InnerProduct subprotocols appear in great numbers and many places. They can all be batched. In addition to saving polynomials, this batching facilitates a simpler and more direct proof of zero-knowledge that would not be possible otherwise.</li>

      <li>Batching may apply in more places still. For instance, the sparse MVP procedure benefits from two invocations of a subprotocol that establishes that a given vector is a Lagrange vector, and two more that another vector is a Vandermonde vector. The Lagrange and Vandermonde vector protocols can be merged in order to save polynomials. In fact, this merger extends to multivariate polynomials in more than two variables.</li>

      <li>Concatenating the vectors of left and right wires saves one polynomial, but only if the Hadamard subprotocol can be made to work with the concatenated vector. In particular, this adaptation requires shifting the protocol's second and third arguments. Performing this shift in either basis is possible, but this shift highlights an interesting difference. In the Reed-Solomon codeword basis, the query to the polynomial oracle is multiplied by a constant factor; in</li>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One of the questions that led to the present line of research was to find the Polynomial IOP with the smallest possible number of polynomials in the transcript. In this respect, we report a mitigated success: DenseClaymore has only four polynomials, down 33% from runner-up PLONK; and when restricting to polynomials whose degrees grow linearly with the size of the circuit, then SparseClaymore achieves two polynomials less than Marlin, the only competitor that also admits arbitrary fan-in for linear gates.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, the concrete comparison shows that we were optimizing the wrong metric. Contrary to our expectation, the number of polynomials in the transcript is <em>not</em> the dominant factor of proof size. Indeed, this comparison highlights the importance of balancing a Polynomial IOP’s number of polynomials against its other parameters.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Definition 4 presents one possible definition for the notion that is Polynomial IOP, namely where there is one degree bound <span class="math">\\mathsf{d}</span> that applies to all polynomials. However, all the protocols presented in this paper provide individual degree bounds for each polynomial, corresponding to another possible definition. The discussion following Definition 4 argues that no generality is lost by switching between the two options. We now formalize this intuition.</p>

    <h6 id="sec-44" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Definition 6 (Polynomial IOP with Individual Degree Bounds).</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">\\mathcal{R}</span> be an indexed relation with corresponding indexed language <span class="math">\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{R})</span>, <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span> some finite field, and <span class="math">\\delta:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}</span> a function that maps polynomial indices to their respective degree bounds. A <em>Polynomial IOP for <span class="math">\\mathcal{R}</span> with individual degree bounds <span class="math">\\delta</span></em> is a pair of interactive machines <span class="math">(\\mathsf{P},\\mathsf{V})</span>, satisfying the following description.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li><span class="math">(\\mathsf{P},\\mathsf{V})</span> is an interactive proof for <span class="math">\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{R})</span> with <span class="math">\\mathsf{r}</span> rounds, and with soundness error <span class="math">\\sigma</span>.</li>

      <li><span class="math">\\mathsf{P}</span> sends polynomials <span class="math">f_{i}(X)\\in\\mathbb{F}[X]</span> of degree at most <span class="math">\\delta(i)</span> to <span class="math">\\mathsf{V}</span>.</li>

      <li><span class="math">\\mathsf{V}</span> is an oracle machine with access to a list of oracles, which contains one oracle for each polynomial it has received from the prover.</li>

      <li>When an oracle associated with a polynomial <span class="math">f_{i}(X)</span> is queried on a point <span class="math">z_{j}\\in\\mathbb{F}</span>, the oracle responds with the value <span class="math">f_{i}(z_{j})</span>.</li>

      <li><span class="math">\\mathsf{V}</span> sends challenges <span class="math">\\alpha_{k}\\in\\mathbb{F}</span> to <span class="math">\\mathsf{P}</span>.</li>

      <li><span class="math">\\mathsf{V}</span> is public coin.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">######</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Showing the equivalence in one direction turns out to be trivial. The next lemma establishes that a Polynomial IOP with individual degree bounds (6) can simulate a Polynomial IOP with a single degree bound (4).</p>

    <h6 id="sec-45" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Lemma 1</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\mathsf{(}(4)\\Rightarrow(6)\\mathsf{)}.</span> Let <span class="math">(\\mathsf{P},\\mathsf{V})</span> be a Polynomial IOP with degree bound <span class="math">\\mathsf{d}</span> for a relation <span class="math">\\mathcal{R}</span> with soundness error <span class="math">\\sigma</span> according to Definition 4. Then <span class="math">(\\mathsf{P},\\mathsf{V})</span> is a Polynomial IOP with individual degree bounds <span class="math">\\delta(i)=\\mathsf{d}</span> for <span class="math">\\mathcal{R}</span> with soundness error <span class="math">\\sigma</span> according to Definition 6.</p>

    <h6 id="sec-46" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Proof.</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The difference between the two definitions is that the <span class="math">i</span>th polynomial <span class="math">f_{i}(X)</span> is guaranteed to be of degree at most <span class="math">\\delta(i)</span> rather than <span class="math">\\mathsf{d}</span>. In this particular case, <span class="math">\\delta(i)=\\mathsf{d}</span>, so there is no difference at all. ∎</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The other direction of the equivalence is more involved as it requires a compiler and comes with a (negligible) soundness degradation as well as one extra polynomial oracle. Let <span class="math">\\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{P})</span> and <span class="math">\\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{V})</span> denote the compiled prover and verifier, respectively. The compiler starts by computing <span class="math">\\mathsf{d}=\\mathsf{max}_{i}\\delta(i)</span>. The compiled prover and verifier then mimick the original prover and verifier, and finalize with the following steps:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li><span class="math">\\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{V})</span> sends a random scalar <span class="math">\\omega\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle\\</span>}}{{\\leftarrow}}\\mathbb{F}\\backslash\\{0\\}$.</li>

      <li><span class="math">\\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{P})</span> sends a single polynomial called the degree bound check polynomial <span class="math">F(X)=\\sum_{i}\\left(\\omega^{2i}\\cdot f_{i}(X)+\\omega^{2i+1}\\cdot X^{\\mathsf{d}-\\delta(i)}\\cdot f_{i}(X)\\right)</span> of degree at most <span class="math">\\mathsf{d}</span>.</li>

      <li><span class="math">\\mathsf{C}(\\mathsf{V})</span> samples all polynomial oracles in a random point <span class="math">z\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle\\</span>}}{{\\leftarrow}}\\mathbb{F}\\backslash\\{0\\}<span class="math"> and tests </span>F(z)\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle?}}{{=}}\\sum_{i}\\left(\\omega^{2i}\\cdot f_{i}(z)+\\omega^{2i+1}\\cdot z^{\\mathsf{d}-\\delta(i)}\\cdot f_{i}(z)\\right)$.</li>

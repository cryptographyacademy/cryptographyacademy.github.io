    <p class="text-gray-300">Abstract. Edwards recently introduced a new normal form for elliptic curves. Every elliptic curve over a non-binary field is birationally equivalent to a curve in Edwards form over an extension of the field, and in many cases over the original field.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This paper presents fast explicit formulas (and register allocations) for group operations on an Edwards curve. The algorithm for doubling uses only <span class="math">3\\mathbf{M} + 4\\mathbf{S}</span>, i.e., 3 field multiplications and 4 field squarings. If curve parameters are chosen to be small then the algorithm for mixed addition uses only <span class="math">9\\mathbf{M} + 1\\mathbf{S}</span> and the algorithm for non-mixed addition uses only <span class="math">10\\mathbf{M} + 1\\mathbf{S}</span>. Arbitrary Edwards curves can be handled at the cost of just one extra multiplication by a curve parameter.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For comparison, the fastest algorithms known for the popular “<span class="math">a_4 = -3</span> Jacobian” form use <span class="math">3\\mathbf{M} + 5\\mathbf{S}</span> for doubling; use <span class="math">7\\mathbf{M} + 4\\mathbf{S}</span> for mixed addition; use <span class="math">11\\mathbf{M} + 5\\mathbf{S}</span> for non-mixed addition; and use <span class="math">10\\mathbf{M} + 4\\mathbf{S}</span> for non-mixed addition when one input has been added before.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The explicit formulas for non-mixed addition on an Edwards curve can be used for doublings at no extra cost, simplifying protection against side-channel attacks. Even better, many elliptic curves (approximately <span class="math">1/4</span> of all isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over a non-binary finite field) are birationally equivalent—over the original field—to Edwards curves where this addition algorithm works for all pairs of curve points, including inverses, the neutral element, etc.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This paper contains an extensive comparison of different forms of elliptic curves and different coordinate systems for the basic group operations (doubling, mixed addition, non-mixed addition, and unified addition) as well as higher-level operations such as multi-scalar multiplication.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">1 Introduction</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The core operations in elliptic-curve cryptography are single-scalar multiplication (<span class="math">m,P\\mapsto mP</span>), double-scalar multiplication (<span class="math">m,n,P,Q\\mapsto mP+nQ</span>), etc. Miller, in his Crypto ’85 paper introducing elliptic-curve cryptography, proposed carrying out these operations on points represented in Jacobian form: “Each point is represented by the triple <span class="math">(x,y,z)</span> which corresponds to the point <span class="math">(x/z^{2},y/z^{3})</span>” on a curve <span class="math">y^{2}=x^{3}+a_{4}x+a_{6}</span>. See <em>[37, page 424]</em>. One can add two points using 16 field multiplications, specifically <span class="math">11\\mathbf{M}+5\\mathbf{S}</span>, with the fastest algorithms known today; here we keep separate tallies of squarings <span class="math">\\mathbf{S}</span> and general multiplications <span class="math">\\mathbf{M}</span>. A mixed addition — this means that one input has <span class="math">z=1</span> — takes only <span class="math">7\\mathbf{M}+4\\mathbf{S}</span>. A doubling takes <span class="math">1\\mathbf{M}+8\\mathbf{S}+1\\mathbf{D}</span>, where <span class="math">\\mathbf{D}</span> denotes the cost of multiplying by <span class="math">a_{4}</span>; a doubling takes <span class="math">3\\mathbf{M}+5\\mathbf{S}</span> in the special case <span class="math">a_{4}=-3</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Several subsequent papers analyzed the performance of other forms of elliptic curves proposed in the mathematical literature. See, e.g., <em>[18]</em> for the speed of several dialects of the Weierstrass form, <em>[34]</em> for the speed of Jacobi intersections, <em>[28]</em> for the speed of Hessians, and <em>[9]</em> for the speed of Jacobi quartics; see also <em>[38]</em> and <em>[23]</em>, which introduced the Montgomery and Doche/Icart/Kohel forms and analyzed their speed. These alternate forms attracted some interest — in particular, many of them simplify protection against side-channel attacks, and the speed records in <em>[7]</em> for single-scalar multiplication were set with the Montgomery form — but the Jacobian form remained the overall speed leader for multi-scalar multiplication.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A new form for elliptic curves was added to the mathematical literature a few months ago: Edwards showed in <em>[25]</em> that all elliptic curves over number fields could be transformed to the shape <span class="math">x^{2}+y^{2}=c^{2}(1+x^{2}y^{2})</span>, with <span class="math">(0,c)</span> as neutral element and with the surprisingly simple and symmetric addition law</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">(x_{1},y_{1}),(x_{2},y_{2})\\mapsto\\left(\\frac{x_{1}y_{2}+y_{1}x_{2}}{c(1+x_{1}x_{2}y_{1}y_{2})},\\frac{y_{1}y_{2}-x_{1}x_{2}}{c(1-x_{1}x_{2}y_{1}y_{2})}\\right).</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Similarly, all elliptic curves over non-binary finite fields can be transformed to Edwards form. Some elliptic curves require a field extension for the transformation, but some elliptic curves have transformations defined over the original number field or finite field.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To capture a larger class of elliptic curves over the original field, we expand the notion of Edwards form to include all curves <span class="math">x^{2}+y^{2}=c^{2}(1+dx^{2}y^{2})</span> where <span class="math">cd(1-dc^{4})\\neq 0</span>. More than <span class="math">1/4</span> of all isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over a finite field — for example, the curve “Curve25519” previously used to set speed records for single-scalar multiplication — can be transformed to Edwards curves over the same field. See §2 and §3 of this paper for further background on Edwards curves.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our main goal in this paper is to analyze the impact of Edwards curves upon cryptographic applications. Our main conclusions are that the Edwards form (1) breaks solidly through the Jacobian speed barrier, (2) is competitive with the Montgomery form for single-scalar multiplication, and (3) is the new speed</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Faster addition and doubling on elliptic curves</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">leader for multi-scalar multiplication. Specifically, we present explicit formulas (i.e., sequences of additions, subtractions, and multiplications) that</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>compute an addition <span class="math">(X_{1}:Y_{1}:Z_{1}),(X_{2}:Y_{2}:Z_{2})\\mapsto(X_{1}:Y_{1}:Z_{1})+(X_{2}:Y_{2}:Z_{2})</span> using <span class="math">10{\\bf M}+1{\\bf S}+1{\\bf D}</span>—here <span class="math">{\\bf D}</span> is the cost of multiplying by a selectable curve parameter;</li>

      <li>compute a mixed addition <span class="math">(X_{1}:Y_{1}:Z_{1}),(X_{2}:Y_{2}:1)\\mapsto(X_{1}:Y_{1}:Z_{1})+(X_{2}:Y_{2}:1)</span> using <span class="math">9{\\bf M}+1{\\bf S}+1{\\bf D}</span>; and</li>

      <li>compute a doubling <span class="math">(X_{1}:Y_{1}:Z_{1})\\mapsto 2(X_{1}:Y_{1}:Z_{1})</span> using <span class="math">3{\\bf M}+4{\\bf S}</span>.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">See §4 for details of these computations; §5 for a comparison of these speeds to the speeds of explicit formulas for Jacobian, Hessian, etc.; §6 and §7 for an analysis of the resulting speeds of single-scalar multiplication and general multi-scalar multiplication; and §8 for a discussion of side-channel attacks.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">An Edwards curve with a unique point of order 2 has the extra feature that the addition formulas are complete. This means that the formulas work for all pairs of input points on the curve, with no exceptions for doubling, no exceptions for the neutral element, no exceptions for negatives, etc. Some previous addition formulas have been advertised as unified formulas that can handle generic doublings, simplifying protection against side-channel attacks; our addition formulas are faster than previous unified formulas and have the stronger property of completeness. See §3, §5, and §8 for further discussion.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-2" class="text-2xl font-bold">2 Transformation to Edwards form</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Fix a field <span class="math">k</span> of characteristic different from 2. Let <span class="math">E</span> be an elliptic curve over <span class="math">k</span> having a point of order 4. This section shows that some quadratic twist of <span class="math">E</span> is birationally equivalent over <span class="math">k</span> to an Edwards curve: specifically, a curve of the form <span class="math">x^{2}+y^{2}=1+dx^{2}y^{2}</span> with <span class="math">d\\notin\\{0,1\\}</span>. (Perhaps this twist is <span class="math">E</span> itself; perhaps not.) §3 shows that the Edwards addition law on the Edwards curve corresponds to the standard elliptic-curve addition law.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If <span class="math">E</span> has a unique point of order 2 then some quadratic twist of <span class="math">E</span> is birationally equivalent over <span class="math">k</span> to an Edwards curve having non-square <span class="math">d</span>. If <span class="math">k</span> is finite and <span class="math">E</span> has a unique point of order 2 then the twist can be removed: <span class="math">E</span> is birationally equivalent over <span class="math">k</span> to an Edwards curve having non-square <span class="math">d</span>. §3 shows that the Edwards addition law is complete in this case.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">All of these equivalences can be computed efficiently. The proof of Theorem 2.1 explicitly constructs <span class="math">d</span> given a Weierstrass-form elliptic curve, and explicitly maps points between the Weierstrass curve and the Edwards curve.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As an example, consider the elliptic curve published in <em>[7]</em> for fast scalar multiplication in Montgomery form, namely the elliptic curve <span class="math">v^{2}=u^{3}+486662u^{2}+u</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Daniel J. Bernstein and Tanja Lange</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">modulo <span class="math">p = 2^{255} - 19</span>. This curve "Curve25519" is birationally equivalent over <span class="math">\\mathbf{Z}/p</span> to the Edwards curve <span class="math">x^{2} + y^{2} = 1 + (121665/121666)x^{2}y^{2}</span>. The transformation is easy: simply define <span class="math">x = \\sqrt{486664}u/v</span> and <span class="math">y = (u - 1)/(u + 1)</span>; note that 486664 is a square modulo <span class="math">p</span>. The inverse transformation is just as easy: simply define <span class="math">u = (1 + y)/(1 - y)</span> and <span class="math">v = \\sqrt{486664}u/x</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Every Edwards curve has a point of order 4; see §3. So it is natural to consider elliptic curves having points of order 4. What about elliptic curves that do not have points of order 4—for example, the NIST curves over prime fields? Construct an extension field <span class="math">k&#x27;</span> of <span class="math">k</span> such that <span class="math">E(k&#x27;)</span>, the group of points of <span class="math">E</span> defined over <span class="math">k&#x27;</span>, has an element of order 4. Then replace <span class="math">k</span> by <span class="math">k&#x27;</span> in Theorem 2.1 to see that some twist of <span class="math">E</span> is birationally equivalent over <span class="math">k&#x27;</span> to an Edwards curve defined over <span class="math">k&#x27;</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Theorem 2.1. Let <span class="math">k</span> be a field in which <span class="math">2 \\neq 0</span>. Let <span class="math">E</span> be an elliptic curve over <span class="math">k</span> such that the group <span class="math">E(k)</span> has an element of order 4. Then</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(1) there exists <span class="math">d \\in k - \\{0,1\\}</span> such that the curve <span class="math">x^{2} + y^{2} = 1 + dx^{2}y^{2}</span> is birationally equivalent over <span class="math">k</span> to a quadratic twist of <span class="math">E</span>; (2) if <span class="math">E(k)</span> has a unique element of order 2 then there is a nonsquare <span class="math">d \\in k</span> such that the curve <span class="math">x^2 + y^2 = 1 + dx^2 y^2</span> is birationally equivalent over <span class="math">k</span> to a quadratic twist of <span class="math">E</span>; and (3) if <span class="math">k</span> is finite and <span class="math">E(k)</span> has a unique element of order 2 then there is a nonsquare <span class="math">d \\in k</span> such that the curve <span class="math">x^2 + y^2 = 1 + dx^2 y^2</span> is birationally equivalent over <span class="math">k</span> to <span class="math">E</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof. Write <span class="math">E</span> in long Weierstrass form <span class="math">s^2 + a_1rs + a_3s = r^3 + a_2r^2 + a_4r + a_6</span>. Assume without loss of generality that <span class="math">a_1 = 0</span> and <span class="math">a_3 = 0</span>; to handle the general case, define <span class="math">\\overline{s} = s + (a_1r + a_3)/2</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Write <span class="math">P</span> for the hypothesized point of order 4 on <span class="math">E</span>. Assume without loss of generality that <span class="math">2P = (0,0)</span> and thus <span class="math">a_6 = 0</span>; to handle the general case, define <span class="math">\\overline{r} = r - r_2</span> where <span class="math">2P = (r_2, s_2)</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The elliptic curve <span class="math">E</span> now has the form <span class="math">s^2 = r^3 + a_2r^2 + a_4r</span>. Write <span class="math">P</span> as <span class="math">(r_1, s_1)</span>. The next step is to express <span class="math">a_2</span> and <span class="math">a_4</span> in terms of <span class="math">r_1</span> and <span class="math">s_1</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that <span class="math">s_1 \\neq 0</span>, as otherwise <span class="math">P</span> has order 2. Consequently <span class="math">r_1 \\neq 0</span>. The equation <span class="math">2P = (0,0)</span> means that the tangent line to <span class="math">E</span> at <span class="math">P</span> passes through <span class="math">(0,0)</span>, i.e., that <span class="math">s_1 - 0 = (r_1 - 0)\\lambda</span> where <span class="math">\\lambda</span> is the tangent slope <span class="math">(3r_1^2 + 2a_2r_1 + a_4)/2s_1</span>. Thus <span class="math">3r_1^3 + 2a_2r_1^2 + a_4r_1 = 2s_1^2</span>. Also <span class="math">2s_1^2 = 2r_1^3 + 2a_2r_1^2 + 2a_4r_1</span> since <span class="math">P</span> is on the curve. Subtract to see that <span class="math">r_1^3 = a_4r_1</span>, i.e., <span class="math">r_1^2 = a_4</span>. Furthermore <span class="math">a_2 = (s_1^2 - r_1^3 - a_4r_1)/r_1^2 = s_1^2/r_1^2 - 2r_1</span>. Putting <span class="math">d = 1 - 4r_1^3/s_1^2</span> we obtain <span class="math">a_2 = 2((1 + d)/(1 - d))r_1</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that <span class="math">d \\neq 1</span> since <span class="math">r_1 \\neq 0</span>. Note also that <span class="math">d \\neq 0</span>: otherwise the right hand side of <span class="math">E</span>'s equation would be <span class="math">r^3 + a_2r^2 + a_4r = r^3 + 2r_1r^2 + r_1^2r = r(r + r_1)^2</span>, contradicting the hypothesis that <span class="math">E</span> is elliptic. Note also that if <span class="math">d</span> is a square then there is another point of order 2 in <span class="math">E(k)</span>, namely <span class="math">\\left(r_{1}(\\sqrt{d} + 1) / (\\sqrt{d} - 1), 0\\right)</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Consider two quadratic twists of <span class="math">E</span>, namely the elliptic curves <span class="math">E&#x27;</span> and <span class="math">E&#x27;&#x27;</span> defined by <span class="math">(r_1 / (1 - d))s^2 = r^3 + a_2r^2 + a_4r</span> and <span class="math">(dr_1 / (1 - d))s^2 = r^3 + a_2r^2 + a_4r</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Faster addition and doubling on elliptic curves</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If <span class="math">k</span> is finite and <span class="math">d</span> is nonsquare then either <span class="math">r_1 / (1 - d)</span> or <span class="math">dr_1 / (1 - d)</span> is a square in <span class="math">k</span> so <span class="math">E</span> is isomorphic to either <span class="math">E&#x27;</span> or <span class="math">E&#x27;&#x27;</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Substitute <span class="math">u = r / r_1</span> and <span class="math">v = s / r_1</span> to see that <span class="math">E&#x27;</span> is isomorphic to the elliptic curve <span class="math">(1 / (1 - d))v^2 = u^3 + 2((1 + d) / (1 - d))u^2 + u</span> and that <span class="math">E&#x27;&#x27;</span> is isomorphic to <span class="math">(d / (1 - d))v^2 = u^3 + 2((1 + d) / (1 - d))u^2 + u</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We now show that the curve <span class="math">x^{2} + y^{2} = 1 + dx^{2}y^{2}</span> is birationally equivalent to <span class="math">(1 / (1 - d))v^{2} = u^{3} + 2((1 + d) / (1 - d))u^{2} + u</span>, and therefore to <span class="math">E&#x27;</span>. The rational map <span class="math">(u,v) \\mapsto (x,y)</span> is defined by <span class="math">x = 2u / v</span> and <span class="math">y = (u - 1) / (u + 1)</span>; there are only finitely many exceptional points with <span class="math">v(u + 1) = 0</span>. The inverse rational map <span class="math">(x,y) \\mapsto (u,v)</span> is defined by <span class="math">u = (1 + y) / (1 - y)</span> and <span class="math">v = 2(1 + y) / (1 - y)x</span>; there are only finitely many exceptional points with <span class="math">(1 - y)x = 0</span>. A straightforward calculation, included in [8], shows that the inverse rational map produces <span class="math">(u,v)</span> satisfying <span class="math">(1 / (1 - d))v^{2} = u^{3} + 2((1 + d) / (1 - d))u^{2} + u</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Substitute <span class="math">1 / d</span> for <span class="math">d</span> and <span class="math">-u</span> for <span class="math">u</span> to see that <span class="math">x^{2} + y^{2} = 1 + (1 / d)x^{2}y^{2}</span> is birationally equivalent to the curve <span class="math">(1 / (1 - 1 / d))v^{2} = (-u)^{3} + 2((1 + 1 / d) / (1 - 1 / d))(-u)^{2} + (-u)</span>, i.e., to <span class="math">(d / (1 - d))v^{2} = u^{3} + 2((1 + d) / (1 - d))u^{2} + u</span>, and therefore to <span class="math">E&#x27;&#x27;</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To summarize: (1) The curve <span class="math">x^{2} + y^{2} = 1 + dx^{2}y^{2}</span> is equivalent to a quadratic twist <span class="math">E&#x27;</span> of <span class="math">E</span>. (2) If <span class="math">E</span> has a unique point of order 2 then <span class="math">d</span> is a nonsquare and <span class="math">x^{2} + y^{2} = 1 + dx^{2}y^{2}</span> is equivalent to a quadratic twist <span class="math">E&#x27;</span> of <span class="math">E</span>. (3) If <span class="math">k</span> is finite and <span class="math">E</span> has a unique point of order 2 then <span class="math">d</span> is a nonsquare so <span class="math">E</span> is isomorphic to <span class="math">E&#x27;</span> or to <span class="math">E&#x27;&#x27;</span>; thus <span class="math">E</span> is birationally equivalent to <span class="math">x^{2} + y^{2} = 1 + dx^{2}y^{2}</span> or to <span class="math">x^{2} + y^{2} = 1 + (1 / d)x^{2}y^{2}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Notes on isomorphisms. If <span class="math">d = \\overline{d}\\overline{c}^4</span> then the curve <span class="math">x^{2} + y^{2} = 1 + dx^{2}y^{2}</span> is isomorphic to the curve <span class="math">\\overline{x}^2 +\\overline{y}^2 = \\overline{c}^2 (1 + \\overline{d}\\overline{x}^2\\overline{y}^2)</span>: simply define <span class="math">\\overline{x} = \\overline{c} x</span> and <span class="math">\\overline{y} = \\overline{c} y</span>. In particular, if <span class="math">k</span> is a finite field, then at least <span class="math">1 / 4</span> of the nonzero elements of <span class="math">k</span> are 4th powers, so <span class="math">d / \\overline{d}</span> is a 4th power for at least <span class="math">1 / 4</span> of the choices of <span class="math">\\overline{d}\\in k - \\{0\\}</span>; the smallest qualifying <span class="math">\\overline{d}</span> is typically extremely small.

    <p class="text-gray-300">The next theorem states that, when <span class="math">d</span> is not a square, there are no exceptional points: the denominators in the Edwards addition law cannot be zero. In other words, when <span class="math">d</span> is not a square, the Edwards addition law is complete: it is defined for all pairs of input points on the Edwards curve over <span class="math">k</span>. The set <span class="math">E(k)</span>, with the standard addition law, is isomorphic as a group to the set of points <span class="math">(x_{1},y_{1})\\in k\\times k</span> on the Edwards curve, with the Edwards addition law.

The point at <span class="math">\\infty</span> on Curve25519 corresponds to the point <span class="math">(0,1)</span> on the Edwards curve; the point <span class="math">(0,0)</span> on Curve25519 corresponds to <span class="math">(0,-1)</span>; any other point <span class="math">(u,v)</span> on Curve25519 corresponds to <span class="math">(\\sqrt{486664}u/v, (u-1)/(u+1))</span>; a sum of points on Curve25519 corresponds to a sum of points on the Edwards curve. One can therefore perform a sequence of group operations on points of the elliptic curve <span class="math">v^{2} = u^{3} + 486662u^{2} + u</span> by performing the same sequence of group operations on the corresponding points of the Edwards curve.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The reader might wonder why [11, Theorem 1] ("The smallest cardinality of a complete system of addition laws on <span class="math">E</span> equals two") does not force exceptional cases in the addition law for the curve <span class="math">x^{2} + y^{2} = c^{2}(1 + dx^{2}y^{2})</span>. The simplest answer is that [11, Theorem 1] is concerned with exceptional cases in the algebraic closure of <span class="math">k</span>, whereas we are concerned with exceptional cases in <span class="math">k</span> itself.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The reader might also wonder why we ignore the two projective points <span class="math">(0:1:0)</span> and <span class="math">(1:0:0)</span> on the Edwards curve. The answer is that, although these points might at first glance appear to be defined over <span class="math">k</span>, they are actually singularities of the curve, and resolving the singularities produces four points that are defined over <span class="math">k(\\sqrt{d})</span>, not over <span class="math">k</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof (of Theorem 3.1). The special case <span class="math">d = 1</span> is equivalent to [25, Theorem 8.1]. We could deduce the general case from the special case, but to keep this paper self-contained we instead give a direct proof.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The first ingredient in the proof is a mechanically verifiable polynomial identity. Define <span class="math">T = (x_{1}y_{2} + y_{1}x_{2})^{2}(1 - dx_{1}x_{2}y_{1}y_{2})^{2} + (y_{1}y_{2} - x_{1}x_{2})^{2}(1 + dx_{1}x_{2}y_{1}y_{2})^{2} - d(x_{1}y_{2} + y_{1}x_{2})^{2}(y_{1}y_{2} - x_{1}x_{2})^{2}</span>. The identity says that <span class="math">T = (x_{1}^{2} + y_{1}^{2} - (x_{2}^{2} + y_{2}^{2})dx_{1}^{2}y_{1}^{2})(x_{2}^{2} + y_{2}^{2} - (x_{1}^{2} + y_{1}^{2})dx_{2}^{2}y_{2}^{2})</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The second ingredient is the curve equation, i.e., the hypotheses on <span class="math">(x_{1},y_{1})</span> and <span class="math">(x_{2},y_{2})</span>. Subtract the equation <span class="math">(x_{2}^{2} + y_{2}^{2})dx_{1}^{2}y_{1}^{2} = c^{2}(1 + dx_{2}^{2}y_{2}^{2})dx_{1}^{2}y_{1}^{2}</span> from the equation <span class="math">x_{1}^{2} + y_{1}^{2} = c^{2}(1 + dx_{1}^{2}y_{1}^{2})</span> to see that <span class="math">x_{1}^{2} + y_{1}^{2} - (x_{2}^{2} + y_{2}^{2})dx_{1}^{2}y_{1}^{2} = c^{2}(1 - d^{2}x_{1}^{2}x_{2}^{2}y_{1}^{2}y_{2}^{2})</span>. Similarly <span class="math">x_{2}^{2} + y_{2}^{2} - (x_{1}^{2} + y_{1}^{2})dx_{2}^{2}y_{2}^{2} = c^{2}(1 - d^{2}x_{1}^{2}x_{2}^{2}y_{1}^{2}y_{2}^{2})</span>. Thus <span class="math">T = c^{4}(1 - d^{2}x_{1}^{2}x_{2}^{2}y_{1}^{2}y_{2}^{2})^{2}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The third ingredient is the Edwards addition law, i.e., the definition of <span class="math">(x_{3},y_{3})</span> in terms of <span class="math">x_{1},x_{2},y_{1},y_{2}</span>. We have <span class="math">x_3^2 +y_3^2 -c^2 dx_3^2 y_3^2 = \\frac{(x_1y_2 + y_1x_2)^2}{c^2(1 + dx_1x_2y_1y_2)^2} +</span> <span class="math">\\frac{(y_1y_2 - x_1x_2)^2}{c^2(1 - dx_1x_2y_1y_2)^2} -\\frac{c^2d(x_1y_2 + y_1x_2)^2(y_1y_2 - x_1x_2)^2}{c^4(1 + dx_1x_2y_1y_2)^2(1 - dx_1x_2y_1y_2)^2} = \\frac{T}{c^2(1 + dx_1x_2y_1y_2)^2(1 - dx_1x_2y_1y_2)^2} =</span> <span class="math">\\frac{T}{c^2(1 - d^2x_1^2x_2^2y_1^2y_2^2)^2} = c^2</span>. Thus <span class="math">x_3^2 +y_3^2 = c^2 (1 + dx_3^2 y_3^2)</span> as claimed.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof (of Theorem 3.2). First we show that each <span class="math">P_{i}</span> is in <span class="math">E(k)</span>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">All that remains is to show that <span class="math">P_{1} + P_{2} = P_{3}</span>. There are several cases in the standard addition law for <span class="math">E(k)</span>; the proof thus splits into several cases.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If <span class="math">(x_{1},y_{1}) = (0,c)</span> then <span class="math">(x_{3},y_{3}) = (x_{2},y_{2})</span>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">This section presents fast explicit formulas and register allocations for doubling, mixed addition, etc. on Edwards curves with arbitrary parameters <span class="math">c,d</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As usual we count the number of operations in the underlying field. We keep separate tallies of the number of general multiplications (each costing <span class="math">\\mathbf{M}</span>), squarings (each costing <span class="math">\\mathbf{S}</span>), multiplications by <span class="math">c</span> (each costing <span class="math">\\mathbf{C}</span>), multiplications by <span class="math">d</span> (each costing <span class="math">\\mathbf{D}</span>), and additions/subtractions (each costing <span class="math">\\mathbf{a}</span>). The costs <span class="math">\\mathbf{M},\\mathbf{S},\\mathbf{C},\\mathbf{D},\\mathbf{a}</span> depend on the choice of platform, on the choice of finite field, and on the choice of <span class="math">c</span> and <span class="math">d</span>.</p>

However, we can imagine applications in which <span class="math">c\\neq 1</span> (for example, a curve with a fairly small <span class="math">c</span> and with <span class="math">d=1</span> could have smaller <span class="math">\\mathbf{C}+\\mathbf{D}</span> than an isomorphic curve with <span class="math">\\overline{c}=1</span> and <span class="math">\\overline{d}=c^{4}</span>), so we allow arbitrary <span class="math">(c,d)</span> in our explicit formulas.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Level of detail of the comparison. We follow most of the literature in ignoring the costs of additions, subtractions, and multiplications by small constants. We recognize that these costs (and the costs of non-arithmetic operations) can be quite noticeable in practice, and we plan a more detailed cost evaluation of the Edwards form along the lines of <em>[7]</em>, but for this paper we ignore the costs.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Consider, for example, the usual doubling algorithm for Jacobian coordinates in the case <span class="math">a_{4}=-3</span>: there are 4 squarings, 4 general multiplications, 5 additions and subtractions, and 5 multiplications by the small constants <span class="math">2,3,4,8,8</span>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Some algorithms involve multiplications by curve parameters, such as the parameter <span class="math">d</span> in Edwards curves. Some applications can take advantage of multiplying by a constant <span class="math">d</span>, and some applications can choose curves where <span class="math">d</span> is small, but other applications cannot.

    <p class="text-gray-300">We copied formulas from several sources in the literature; see <em>[24]</em> for an overview. One particularly noteworthy source is the 1986 paper <em>[16]</em> by Chudnovsky and Chudnovsky, containing formulas and operation counts for several forms of elliptic curves: projective, Jacobian, Jacobi quartic, Jacobi intersection, and Hessian. Liardet and Smart in <em>[34]</em> presented faster algorithms for Jacobi intersections. Billet and Joye in <em>[9]</em> presented faster algorithms for Jacobi quartics. Joye and Quisquater in <em>[28]</em> pointed out that the Hessian addition formulas (dating back to Sylvester) could also be used for doublings after a permutation of input coordinates, providing a weak form of unification: specifically, <span class="math">2(X_{1}:Y_{1}:Z_{1})=(Z_{1}:X_{1}:Y_{1})+(Y_{1}:Z_{1}:X_{1})</span>. Brier and Joye in <em>[13]</em> presented unified addition formulas for projective (and affine) coordinates; see also <em>[12]</em>. Of course, we also include our own algorithms for Edwards curves.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Chudnovsky and Chudnovsky also pointed out, in the case of Jacobian coordinates, that <em>readdition</em> of a point is less expensive than the first addition. The addition formulas for <span class="math">(X_{1}:Y_{1}:Z_{1})+(X_{2}:Y_{2}:Z_{2})</span> use <span class="math">1\\mathbf{M}+1\\mathbf{S}</span> to compute <span class="math">Z_{2}^{2}</span> and <span class="math">Z_{2}^{3}</span>; by caching <span class="math">Z_{2}^{2}</span> and <span class="math">Z_{2}^{3}</span> one can save <span class="math">1\\mathbf{M}+1\\mathbf{S}</span> in computing any <span class="math">(X^{\\prime}:Y^{\\prime}:Z^{\\prime})+(X_{2}:Y_{2}:Z_{2})</span>. We comment that similar savings are possible for Jacobi intersections and Jacobi quartics.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(Rather than distinguishing readditions from initial additions, Chudnovsky and Chudnovsky reported speeds for addition and doubling of points represented as <span class="math">(X:Y:Z:Z^{2}:Z^{3})</span>. But this representation is wasteful, as pointed out by Cohen, Miyaji, and Ono in <em>[18]</em>: if <span class="math">(X_{1}:Y_{1}:Z_{1})</span> is used only for a doubling and not for a general addition then there is no need to compute <span class="math">Z_{1}^{3}</span>. Sometimes coordinates <span class="math">(X:Y:Z:Z^{2}:Z^{3})</span> are called “Chudnovsky coordinates” or “Chudnovsky-Jacobian coordinates,” and computing <span class="math">Z^{2}</span> and <span class="math">Z^{3}</span> only when they are needed is called “mixing Chudnovsky coordinates with Jacobian coordinates.” We prefer to describe the same speedup using the simpler concept of readditions.)</p>

For example, as pointed out in [5, pages 16-17], Jacobian doubling with  <span class="math">a = -3</span>  uses  <span class="math">3\\mathbf{M} + 5\\mathbf{S}</span>  rather than the usual  <span class="math">4\\mathbf{M} + 4\\mathbf{S}</span> . As another example, Doche/Icart/Kohel doubling uses  <span class="math">2\\mathbf{M} + 5\\mathbf{S} + 2\\mathbf{D}</span>  rather than  <span class="math">3\\mathbf{M} + 4\\mathbf{S} + 2\\mathbf{D}</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">Most of the addition formulas in this last table are strongly unified: they work without change for doublings. The Hessian addition algorithm is an exception: it works for doublings only after a permutation of input coordinates. As mentioned earlier, the addition algorithm for Edwards curves with non-square  <span class="math">d</span>  has the stronger feature of being complete: it works without change for all inputs.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Daniel J. Bernstein and Tanja Lange</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This section compares Edwards curves to previous curve forms for single-scalar variable-point multiplication: computing  <span class="math">nP</span>  given an integer  <span class="math">n</span>  and a curve point  <span class="math">P</span> . This is one of the critical computations in elliptic-curve cryptography; for example, if  <span class="math">n</span>  is a secret key and  <span class="math">P</span>  is another user's public key then  <span class="math">nP</span>  is a Diffie-Hellman secret shared between the two users. The next section considers variations of the same problem: fixed points  <span class="math">P</span>  (allowing precomputation of, e.g.,  <span class="math">2^{128}P</span> ), more scalars and points, etc.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">See [2] and [22] for surveys of the classic algorithms for scalar multiplication. We focus on "signed sliding window" algorithms, specifically with "window width 1" (also known as "non-adjacent form" or "NAF") or "window width 4." We also discuss the "Montgomery ladder."</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We make the standard assumption that the input point  <span class="math">P</span>  has  <span class="math">Z = 1</span> . All additions of  <span class="math">P</span>  can thus be computed as mixed additions. By scaling other points to have  <span class="math">Z = 1</span>  one can create more mixed additions at the expense of extra field inversions; for the sake of simplicity we ignore this option in our comparison.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The NAF algorithm, for an average  <span class="math">b</span> -bit scalar  <span class="math">n</span> , uses approximately  <span class="math">b</span>  doublings and approximately  <span class="math">(1/3)b</span>  mixed additions. So we tally the cost of 1 doubling and  <span class="math">1/3</span>  mixed additions:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Another approach to high-speed single-scalar multiplication is Montgomery's algorithm in [38] for  <span class="math">x</span> -coordinate operations on curves in Montgomery form  <span class="math">y^{2} = x^{3} + ax^{2} + x</span> . This algorithm does not support fast addition  <span class="math">P, Q \\mapsto P + Q</span> ,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Faster addition and doubling on elliptic curves</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">does not support arbitrary addition chains, and does not fit into our previous tables; but it does support fast "differential addition"  <span class="math">P - Q, P, Q \\mapsto P + Q</span> , and therefore fast computation of "differential addition-subtraction chains."</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In particular, the "Montgomery ladder" uses  <span class="math">5\\mathbf{M} + 4\\mathbf{S} + 1\\mathbf{D}</span>  per bit of  <span class="math">n</span>  to compute  <span class="math">P \\mapsto nP</span> . For comparison, the NAF algorithm for Edwards curves with our formulas takes  <span class="math">6\\mathbf{M} + 4.33\\mathbf{S} + 0.333\\mathbf{D}</span>  per bit of  <span class="math">n</span> , clearly slower than  <span class="math">5\\mathbf{M} + 4\\mathbf{S} + 1\\mathbf{D}</span>  per bit. But signed width-4 sliding windows take only  <span class="math">4.86\\mathbf{M} + 4.12\\mathbf{S} + 0.194\\mathbf{D}</span>  per bit for  <span class="math">b = 256</span> , saving  <span class="math">0.14\\mathbf{M} - 0.12\\mathbf{S} + 0.806\\mathbf{D}</span>  per bit. Note that Edwards form is less sensitive to a large  <span class="math">\\mathbf{D}</span>  than Montgomery form. Larger  <span class="math">b</span> 's favor larger window widths, reducing the number of additions per bit and making Edwards curves even more attractive.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">General multi-scalar multiplication means computing  <span class="math">\\sum n_i P_i</span>  given integers  <span class="math">n_i</span>  and curve points  <span class="math">P_i</span> . Specific tasks are obtained by specifying the number of points, by specifying which points are known in advance, by specifying which integers are known in advance, etc. See generally [2] and [22].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We focus on four specific algorithms: the popular "joint sparse form" ("JSF") algorithm for computing  <span class="math">n_1P_1 + n_2P_2</span> , given  <span class="math">b</span> -bit integers  <span class="math">n_1, n_2</span>  and curve points  <span class="math">P_1, P_2</span> ; the accelerated ECDSA verification algorithm in [1, page 9]; batch verification of elliptic-curve signatures, using the "Small Exponents Test" from [4, §3.3] and the multi-scalar multiplication algorithm that de Rooij in [20, §4] credits to Bos and Coster; and computation of  <span class="math">nP</span>  for a fixed point  <span class="math">P</span> , using a standard "comb" table containing 90 precomputed multiples of  <span class="math">P</span> , essentially  <span class="math">2^{\\{0,1,2,3,4,5\\}b/6}(\\{0,1\\}P + \\{0,1\\}2^{b/24}P + \\{0,1\\}2^{2b/24}P + \\{0,1\\}2^{3b/24}P)</span> , normalized to have  <span class="math">Z = 1</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The JSF algorithm uses about  <span class="math">b</span>  doublings, about  <span class="math">(1/4)b</span>  mixed additions (for average  <span class="math">n_1, n_2</span> ), and about  <span class="math">(1/4)b</span>  readditions. So we tally the cost of 1 doubling,  <span class="math">1/4</span>  mixed additions, and  <span class="math">1/4</span>  readditions:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Montgomery's  <span class="math">x</span> -coordinate algorithm in [38] can also be used for multiscalar multiplication, but does not seem to provide competitive performance as the number of scalars increases, despite recent differential-addition-chain improvements in [6] and [14].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Faster addition and doubling on elliptic curves</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The scalar-multiplication algorithms discussed in §6 and §7 are often unacceptable for cryptographic hardware and embedded systems. Many secret bits of the integers  <span class="math">n_i</span>  are leaked, through the pattern of doublings and mixed additions and non-mixed additions, to side-channel attacks such as simple power analysis. See generally [27], [33], and [36].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One response is to use a fixed pattern of doublings, mixed additions, etc., independent of the integers  <span class="math">n_i</span> . Another response is to hide the pattern of doublings, mixed additions, etc. Some of these responses still leak the Hamming weight in the single-scalar case, and the total number of operations in the general case, but this information can be shielded at low cost in other ways. Of course, at a lower level, field operations must be individually shielded. In particular, an operation counted as  <span class="math">\\mathbf{M}</span>  must be carried out by a multiplication unit whose time, power consumption, etc. do not depend on the inputs. Even if the inputs happen to be the same, and even if a faster squaring unit is available, the multiplication must not be carried out by the squaring unit. An operation counted as  <span class="math">\\mathbf{S}</span>  can be carried out by a faster squaring unit whose time, power consumption, etc. do not depend on the input.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We focus on four specific side-channel countermeasures: non-sliding windows with digits  <span class="math">\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\\}</span> ; signed width-4 sliding windows with unified addition-or-doubling formulas; width-4 sliding windows with atomic blocks; and the Montgomery ladder. For concreteness we consider two examples of primitives: first single-scalar multiplication and then triple-scalar multiplication. Extra scalars produce extra additions, reducing the importance of doublings, as in §7; in particular, extra scalars make unified formulas more attractive.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We also discuss differential attacks at the end of the section.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Single-scalar multiplication. Non-sliding windows with digits  <span class="math">\\{1,2,3,\\ldots ,8\\}</span>  use, on average, approximately  <span class="math">b - 1.9</span>  doublings and  <span class="math">b / 3 + 6</span>  readditions for single-scalar multiplication: e.g., 254.1 doublings and 91.4 readditions for  <span class="math">b = 256</span> . So we tally the cost of  <span class="math">254.1 / 256\\approx 0.99</span>  doublings and  <span class="math">91.4 / 256\\approx 0.36</span>  readditions:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Next we consider signed width-4 sliding windows with atomic blocks. In [15], Chevallier-Mames, Ciet, and Joye presented Jacobian-coordinate formulas using 10 atomic blocks for doubling and 16 atomic blocks for addition. Each block costs  <span class="math">1\\mathbf{M}</span>  and consists of one field multiplication, one field addition, one field negation, and another field addition; many of the additions and negations are dummy operations. Barbosa and Page in [3] presented automatic tools that turn arbitrary explicit formulas using  <span class="math">m\\mathbf{M} + s\\mathbf{S}</span>  into formulas using  <span class="math">m + s</span>  atomic blocks, each consisting of one field multiplication and some number of field additions and negations, thus costing  <span class="math">1\\mathbf{M}</span> . So we tally the cost of 0.98 doublings, 0.17 readditions, 0.025 mixed additions, and 0.0035 non-mixed additions, as in §6, except that we insist on  <span class="math">\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{M}</span> :</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The Montgomery ladder can be generalized to a multi-scalar multiplication method using a fixed pattern of doublings and additions, as discussed in [6] and [14], but the performance of the generalization degrades rapidly as the number of scalars increases, as mentioned in §7.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Countermeasures against differential and correlation side-channel attacks. Curves in Edwards form are compatible with countermeasures against differential and correlation side-channel attacks:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>Randomized representations of scalars as addition-subtraction chains; see, e.g., [42] and [34, §4]. Our point representation supports arbitrary additions and subtractions.</li>

      <li>Randomized scalars; see, e.g., [19, §5.1].</li>

      <li>Randomized coordinates; see, e.g., [19, §5.3]. Our point representation is redundant and can be scaled freely:  <span class="math">(X_{1}:Y_{1}:Z_{1}) = (\\lambda X_{1}:\\lambda Y_{1}:\\lambda Z_{1})</span>  for any  <span class="math">\\lambda \\neq 0</span> .</li>

      <li>Randomized points, for example computing  <span class="math">nP</span>  as  <span class="math">n(P + Q) - nQ</span> ; see, e.g., [19, §5.2]. Our point representation supports arbitrary additions and subtractions.</li>

      <li>Randomized curves; see, e.g., [33, §29.2]. Using the generalized addition law involving  <span class="math">c</span>  and  <span class="math">d</span>  one can easily transfer the computation to an isomorphic curve with  <span class="math">\\bar{c}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\bar{d}</span>  satisfying  <span class="math">dc^4 = \\bar{d}\\bar{c}^4</span> . As another example, one can perform computations on a 3-isogenous curve.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We suggest using a combination of these countermeasures. In particular, point randomization or scalar randomization appears to be vital to counteract Goubin-type attacks.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Curves in Edwards form are also compatible with countermeasures to other types of attacks discussed in [36].</p>

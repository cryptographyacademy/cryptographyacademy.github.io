    <p class="text-gray-300">Abstract. Gröbner basis cryptanalysis of hash functions and ciphers, and their underlying permutations, has seen renewed interest recently. Anemoi (Crypto'23) is a permutation-based hash function that is efficient for a variety of arithmetizations used in zero-knowledge proofs. In this paper, exploring both theoretical bounds as well as experimental validation, we present new complexity estimates for Gröbner basis attacks on the Anemoi permutation over prime fields.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We cast our findings in what we call the six worlds of Gröbner basis cryptanalysis. As an example, keeping the same security arguments of the design, we conclude that at least 41 instead of 37 rounds would need to be used for 256-bit security, whereby our suggestion does not yet include a security margin.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The idea of solving systems of polynomial equations that stem from problems in block cipher or hash function cryptanalysis by means of symbolic computation has a decades-long tradition. Such means include, among others, Gröbner basis techniques or polynomial factorization.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Symbolic computation approaches for cryptanalysis of block ciphers and hash functions saw a major wave of attention around the time Rijndael was standardized as AES and the years afterwards [CP02, CMR05, AC09, CL05, SKPI07], albeit with an unclear impact on designs at that time. More recently, however, such approaches have been having more impact on new designs, especially in the area of MPC/FHE/ZK-friendly ciphers and hashing. Examples include Gröbner basis attacks on Friday and Jarvis [ACG⁺19, BSGL20], attacks on MiMC combining higher-order differential distinguishers with polynomial factorization [EGL⁺20, BCP23, LP19, RAS20], an attack on Grendel [GKRS22] leveraging polynomial factorization, or attacks on unusual parameterizations of Poseidon [ABM24].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A recurring theme in works that propose designs in symmetric cryptography for encryption or hashing is the choice of a secure number of rounds. Usually, all known attack vectors are considered, and the most performant one determines a secure number of rounds, including a certain security margin. Recent arithmetization-friendly designs often assume Gröbner basis cryptanalysis to be the most crucial attack vector. This assertion seems sound since often better understood statistical and other algebraic attacks cover fewer rounds. However, estimating the complexity of Gröbner basis attacks is, in general, difficult.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We briefly review the state-of-the-art approach for Gröbner basis cryptanalysis in Section 1.1. In Section 1.2, we outline our contributions and discuss a concrete application to Anemoi [BBC⁺23], a permutation-based hash function that is arithmetization-friendly, i.e., efficient for a variety of arithmetizations used in zero-knowledge proofs.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">1.1 The Common Approach of Gröbner Basis Attacks</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Conceptually, using Gröbner bases in cryptanalysis comprises two stages.</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>Modeling a cryptographic primitive as a system of polynomial equations with unknown parameters as variables. A parameter of interest might be the secret key of a block cipher, a solution to the constrained-input constrained output (CICO) problem <em>[x1]</em> of a permutation used in Sponge hashing mode, or the preimage of a given hash value. Often, it is possible to describe the same primitive using different models.</li>

      <li>Solving the system of polynomial equations using Gröbner basis techniques. We note that equation systems stemming from problems in symmetric cryptography often have a finite number of solutions. Hence, we usually deal with equation systems that generate a zero-dimensional ideal. “Solving” commonly means finding exactly one solution, and the solving process encompasses a triad of computations, namely,</li>

    </ol>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>GB: computing a degree reverse lexicographic (DRL) Gröbner basis using an off-the-shelf Gröbner basis algorithm such as, e.g., F4 <em>[x11]</em>,</li>

      <li>FGLM: converting the DRL Gröbner basis (of a zero-dimensional ideal) to the (reduced) lexicographic (LEX) Gröbner basis using a conversion algorithm such as the FGLM algorithm <em>[x10]</em>,</li>

      <li>FAC: factorizing the (unique) univariate polynomial in the (reduced) LEX Gröbner basis using a polynomial factoring algorithm such as a fast version of Cantor-Zassenhaus <em>[x17]</em>. The roots of the univariate polynomial determine partial solutions of the equation system. If needed, back-substitute any partial solution into the other equations from the LEX Gröbner basis to obtain (a candidate for) a full solution.</li>

    </ol>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A Gröbner basis attack reduces the problem of multivariate root finding to the problem of univariate root finding. This can be seen as follows: a (reduced) LEX Gröbner basis is in triangular form <em>[x2]</em>, much like the reduced row echelon form after Gaussian elimination yields a matrix in triangular form. This means that a (reduced) LEX basis always contains a univariate polynomial, which we can factor.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-3" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1.2 Our Contribution and Related Work</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the context of Gröbner basis cryptanalysis, three main approaches are used to estimate attack complexities and derive round numbers:</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>Using theoretical upper bounds on the complexity metrics. This method often overestimates complexity, underestimates necessary rounds, and requires assumptions that may not hold.</li>

      <li>Running small-scale experiments on round-reduced ciphers to extrapolate complexity metrics. Extrapolation techniques have been heavily used in the past: <em>[ACG^{+}19]</em>, <em>[AAB^{+}20]</em>, <em>[x1]</em>, <em>[BBC^{+}23]</em>, <em>[x19]</em>, <em>[x2]</em>. This approach typically provides better estimations but might introduce a heuristic gap.</li>

      <li>Leveraging dedicated (weighted) monomial orderings with respect to which a given polynomial system is already a Gröbner basis. Subsequently, better bounds of the complexity metric can be derived, zero-dimensionality can be proven, and dedicated basis conversion algorithms may be applied: <em>[BBL^{+}24, x22, x23, x3]</em>.</li>

    </ol>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We develop a refined methodology that combines the strengths of (i) and (ii), addressing their respective limitations. Our “Six Worlds” offers cryptographic designers a tool for evaluating and understanding the security implications of each step of a Gröbner basis attack. In particular, we apply our methodology to the permutation Anemoi <em>[BBC+23]</em> and identify specific instances that may be susceptible to Gröbner basis attacks.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-4" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">The six worlds of Gröbner basis cryptanalysis.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the three steps of a Gröbner basis attack, there are (E) experimental and (T) theoretical approaches to determine their complexity in terms of computational effort. In total, these six approaches give rise to what we call the six worlds of Gröbner basis cryptanalysis. Establishing complexity estimates for each of these six worlds contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of Gröbner basis cryptanalysis. See Section 3.1 for an overview of our methodology. Our contributions extend existing and offer new methods to assess the hardness of Step (1) and Step (2).</p>

    <h4 id="sec-5" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Algebraic models.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We provide a more detailed analysis of the two algebraic models of Anemoi, called <span class="math">\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{CICO}}</span> and <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{CICO}}</span>, presented in <em>[BBC+23]</em>. Analyzing the evolution of the polynomial degrees in the second model, <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{CICO}}</span>, lies the foundation for a tighter theoretical bound in Step (2) of a Gröbner basis attack. See Section 4.2.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-6" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Tighter theoretical bounds for Step (2).</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We extend results in <em>[x29, x11]</em> and leverage multihomogeneous Bézout theory to estimate the complexity of converting between Gröbner bases in Step (2). In contrast to the ciphers studied in <em>[x11]</em>, where the multihomogeneous Bézout bound was first applied in the context of algebraic cryptanalysis, the algebraic structure of the model <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{CICO}}</span> is more involved. We thus employ a search approach for variable set partitions that minimizes the multihomogeneous Bézout bound and inductively prove the corresponding bound by following the steps of the Row Expansion Algorithm <em>[x29]</em>. A comprehensive introduction to the multihomogeneous Bézout bound is given in Appendix A.2. Concrete results for Anemoi are stated in Section 4.4, proofs are provided in Appendix B.3.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-7" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Influence of small fields and the variable ordering.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We demonstrate that there are instantiations of Anemoi over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{n}}</span> for which the cost of Step (1) is negligible. Moreover, we argue that over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p}</span>, the field size for concrete experiments on reduced versions in <em>[BBC+23]</em> has unexpected effects. In particular, varying the underlying variable ordering influences the runtime and estimated complexity of Step (2). See Section 4.3. We provide more consistent experimental results, leading to more reliable extrapolations. See Section 4.4. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the influence of the variable ordering on the Gröbner basis attack, given a concrete monomial ordering such as DRL, has been reported.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-8" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">1.2.1 Concrete results for Anemoi over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p}</span></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As a concrete application of our refined methodology, we analyze in detail the Anemoi permutation <em>[BBC+23]</em> instantiated over prime fields in Section 4. Our findings indicate that to uphold the asserted security level, it might be necessary to increase the number of rounds in some full-round instances of Anemoi. Table 1 summarizes some of our findings in the six worlds for the popular choice of using <span class="math">\\alpha=3</span> as the degree of the power map in the S-box function and gives a comparison with the round number suggestions in <em>[BBC+23]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 1 shows that the strategy used in <em>[BBC+23]</em> – assessing Anemoi’s security in world (E1) based on <span class="math">\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{CICO}}</span> and adding a security margin of four rounds to protect, among other things, against potential threats arising from the second model, <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{CICO}}</span> – is generally insufficient. Specifically, our analysis based on <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{CICO}}</span> indicates that in this specific world,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">41 rounds are required, instead of the proposed 37 rounds, to achieve 256-bit security. Finally, depending on the world under investigation, additional rounds may be necessary to reach the desired security level. Notably, our analysis does not include any security margin. Insights into the six worlds of Gröbner basis cryptanalysis applied to Anemoi and their implications for the security assessment are provided in Sections 4.4 and 4.5.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Concurrent to our work, cryptanalytic results on Anemoi:  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q^{2\\ell} \\to \\mathbb{F}_q^{2\\ell}</span>  are obtained in  <span class="math">[\\mathrm{BBL}^{+}24]</span> ,  <span class="math">[\\mathrm{YZY}^{+}24]</span>  and  <span class="math">[\\mathrm{Bri}24]</span>  with methods different from ours. While our work and  <span class="math">[\\mathrm{BBL}^{+}24, \\mathrm{YZY}^{+}24]</span>  tackle the prominent case  <span class="math">(\\ell, q) = (1, p)</span> ,  <span class="math">[\\mathrm{Bri}24]</span>  considers a more general setting with  <span class="math">\\ell \\geq 1</span>  and  <span class="math">q \\in \\{2^n, p\\}</span> . In particular, after applying a linear change of variables to  <span class="math">\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathrm{CICO}}</span> , the work shows how to identify a weighted DRL ordering such that adding a small number of  <span class="math">S</span> -polynomials leads to a Gröbner basis. Consequently, a general formula for the quotient space dimension was proven. Presumably, the application of the FGLM algorithm would yield similar results as the ones we present in the world (E2). In contrast,  <span class="math">[\\mathrm{BBL}^{+}24]</span>  leverage a specially crafted weighted monomial ordering (called FreeLunch order) such that the polynomial system is already a Gröbner basis and a dedicated three-step solving algorithm ( <span class="math">[\\mathrm{BBL}^{+}24, \\mathrm{Alg. 1}]</span> ) can be applied. Notably, the complexity of the dominating step is extrapolated from experiments on round-reduced primitives, and subsequently, the security analysis for Anemoi considers only one step (polyDet), whose time complexity is similar to the FGLM complexity  <span class="math">[\\mathrm{BBL}^{+}24, \\mathrm{Th. 1}]</span> . Using the conjectured quotient space dimension from  <span class="math">[\\mathrm{BBC}^{+}23]</span> , conclusions similar to ours in world (E2) can be drawn. Finally,  <span class="math">[\\mathrm{YZY}^{+}24]</span>  applies a novel attack framework based on resultants, supplemented by dimension-reduction techniques such as meet-in-the-middle modeling.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Table 2, we give a more detailed comparison to related work. In particular, we compare our results to  <span class="math">\\mathrm{[BBL^{+}24]}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathrm{[YZY^{+}24]}</span> . Both of these works present new attack strategies against Anemoi over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  with  <span class="math">\\ell = 1</span> . Table 2 shows the estimated (time)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">complexity of each attack against Anemoi with a targeted security level of 128 and 256 bits, respectively. To achieve a fair comparison, in particular, with <em>[BBL^{+}24]</em>, we consider our world (E2), i.e., FGLM complexity derived from experimental conjectures, and fix the model <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{CICO}}</span>. For a more detailed and informed comparison, we add several data points with <span class="math">\\omega\\in\\{2,2.37,2.81,3\\}</span> corresponding to common (conservative) choices in the literature from a design perspective and a range of (increasingly pessimistic) choices from an attack perspective. We point out that the question of which concrete choice of <span class="math">\\omega</span> is the “right” one is related to an ongoing research effort for a better understanding of Gröbner basis algorithms (and the involved matrices) on structured equation systems. This question is further complicated by the fact that different methods tend to account for different (structural properties of) matrices when choosing the value of <span class="math">\\omega</span> for deriving complexity estimates. Hence, a direct comparison of different methods with the same value of <span class="math">\\omega</span> might not be immediately informative.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In summary, while <em>[x1]</em> is tailored to the application on Anemoi, <em>[BBL^{+}24]</em> and our work present a more general framework. However, compared to <em>[BBL^{+}24]</em>, our approach is less restricted in its application possibilities. <em>[BBL^{+}24]</em> needs a triangular system and a special condition (Prop. 5) to work. Moreover, due to the nature of the solving approach, <em>[BBL^{+}24]</em> can only be applied to CICO problems with a single input and output element set to zero. This also excludes permutations with a capacity and hash value larger than one field element in Sponge mode. Among these excluded permutations are, e.g., Jarvis, various Poseidon instances, and, in particular, Anemoi for <span class="math">\\ell&gt;1</span>. In contrast, our work doesn’t need these conceptual restrictions and is, thus, applicable in a wider range of settings.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">All results in this section hold for any field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span>. We note, however, that the most relevant case for equation systems stemming from problems in symmetric cryptography is the case of finite fields <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span>.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-12" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2.1 Complexity Estimates for Gröbner Basis Algorithms</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the following discussion, it is convenient to emphasize the connection between the number of equations <span class="math">n_{e}</span> and variables <span class="math">n_{v}</span> in an equation system and the polynomial ring over which this system lives. Thus, we presume to write <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n_{e}}]</span>. The ideal <span class="math">\\mathcal{I}\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n_{e}}]</span> is generated by the polynomials <span class="math">\\{f_{1},\\ldots,f_{n_{e}}\\}</span>. We assume <span class="math">\\mathcal{I}</span> to be zero-dimensional. In the following, <span class="math">\\omega</span> denotes the linear algebra constant, with <span class="math">2\\leq\\omega\\leq 3</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As discussed in Section 1.1, Gröbner basis assisted polynomial system solving involves three steps: Step (1), Step (2), and Step (3). We denote the corresponding complexities by <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{GB}}</span>, <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{FGLM}}</span>, and <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{FAC}}</span>, respectively.</p>

    <h5 id="sec-13" class="text-base font-semibold mt-4">Complexity of Computing a Gröbner Basis.</h5>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Runtime complexities for Gröbner basis algorithms are based on the analysis of matrix-based algorithms such as Lazard <em>[x11, x12]</em>, F4 <em>[x5]</em>, or Matrix-F5 <em>[x3]</em>. The runtime complexity is generally bounded by <em>[x3]</em></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">operations in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span> <em>[x18, Th. 1.72]</em>. Here, <span class="math">d_{\\text{reg}}</span> denotes the degree of regularity, as defined in <em>[x2, §A 2.2.1]</em>. Intuitively, <span class="math">d_{\\text{reg}}</span> corresponds to the maximum degree reached during a Gröbner basis computation. Thus, the overall complexity of computing a Gröbner basis can be understood as being bounded by row-reducing (full-rank) matrices of size <span class="math">\\binom{n_{v}+i-1}{i}\\times\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{e}}\\binom{n_{v}+i-\\text{deg}(f_{j})-1}{i-\\text{deg}(f_{j})}</span>, for <span class="math">i=0,1,\\ldots,d_{\\text{reg}}</span>, eventually leading to the bound in Equation 2. In practice, the Macaulay matrices built during a Gröbner basis computation might be sparse and have a substantial rank defect. Note that the bound in Equation 2 does not account for this particular structure in the Macaulay matrices. Knowledge about this structure potentially allows further improvement of this bound. In practice, it is customary to drop any factors from the asymptotic <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\cdot\\right)</span> notation, which is why we directly use</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathtt{GB}}(n_{e},n_{v},d_{\\text{reg}})=\\sum_{i=0}^{d_{\\text{reg}}}\\binom{n_{v}+i-1}{i}^{\\omega-1}\\cdot\\sum_{j=1}^{n_{v}}\\binom{n_{v}+i-\\text{deg}\\left(f_{j}\\right)-1}{i-\\text{deg}\\left(f_{j}\\right)}</span> (3)</p>

    <h5 id="sec-15" class="text-base font-semibold mt-4">Complexity of Factoring Polynomials.</h5>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Polynomial factorization is a classic problem, and for this purpose, we may choose one of many factoring algorithms <em>[x4, x7, x10, x11, x2, x1]</em>. See also <em>[x15, Section 6.7]</em> for a summary of classical factorization algorithms. For example, a fast version of the (probabilistic) Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm <em>[x7]</em> for factoring a univariate polynomial of degree <span class="math">d_{\\text{uni}}</span> over a finite field with constant cardinality uses an expected number of</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\mathcal{O}\\left(d_{\\text{uni}}{}^{1.815}\\right)</span> (7)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">field operations <em>[x10]</em>. In Step 3, we factor the (unique) univariate polynomial <span class="math">f</span> in the (minimal) LEX Gröbner basis. The polynomial <span class="math">f</span> has the <em>last</em> LEX variable as indeterminate.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This means that factoring <span class="math">f</span> only recovers partial solutions for the last variable. If needed, partial solutions for this variable are back-substituted into the other equations until a full solution is obtained, which might incur some additional costs. In general, we have <span class="math">\\deg\\left(f\\right)\\leq d_{\\mathcal{I}}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Ideals in <em>shape position</em> are an important subclass of zero-dimensional ideals as they have a particularly well-structured LEX Gröbner basis <em>[x1, x11, x2]</em>.</p>

    <h6 id="sec-16" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Remark 1.</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">\\mathcal{I}\\subseteq\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n_{v}}]</span> be an ideal. We say <span class="math">\\mathcal{I}</span> is in <em>shape position</em> if the reduced LEX Gröbner basis of <span class="math">\\mathcal{I}</span> has the form</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\left\\{x_{1}-g_{1}(x_{n_{v}}),\\ldots,x_{n_{v}-1}-g_{n_{v}-1}(x_{n_{v}}),g_{n_{v}}(x_{n_{v}})\\right\\},</span> (8)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">\\deg(g_{i})&lt;\\deg(g_{n_{v}})</span> for <span class="math">1\\leq i&lt;n_{v}</span>. An immediate consequence of an ideal <span class="math">\\mathcal{I}</span> in <span class="math">R=\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n_{v}}]</span> being in shape position is the fact that <em>[x1]</em></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">d_{\\mathcal{I}}=\\dim_{\\mathbb{F}}(R/\\mathcal{I})=\\deg(g_{n_{v}}).</span> (9)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Thus, for ideals in <em>shape position</em>, factoring <span class="math">f</span> recovers the values for the other variables at once. In this case, we know that <span class="math">\\deg\\left(f\\right)=d_{\\mathcal{I}}</span>. We note that our algebraic models for Anemoi lead to ideals in shape position. Hence, in this case, the key parameter for estimating the runtime complexity of Step (3) is <span class="math">d_{\\mathcal{I}}</span>. As above, we directly use the bound</p>

    <h4 id="sec-17" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">The Value of the Linear Algebra Constant <span class="math">\\omega</span>.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the context of algebraic cryptanalysis, the linear algebra constant <span class="math">\\omega</span> often (tacitly) carries a double meaning. On the one hand, it serves as the ordinary linear algebra exponent for dense matrix multiplication with <span class="math">\\omega\\approx 2.37</span>. On the other hand, it is also used to account for the special structure in the (Macaulay) matrices built during Step (1) and Step (2) <em>[x3, x11]</em>. This double meaning complicates the matter of choosing a concrete value for <span class="math">\\omega</span>, especially when arguing about a secure number of rounds and/or the purported complexity of an attack.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In general, choosing a lower value for <span class="math">\\omega</span> can be seen as a conservative choice for a designer and an aggressive one for an attacker – and vice-versa. A common choice in the literature, for both viewpoints, is <span class="math">\\omega=2</span> <em>[ACG^{+}19, x2, AAB^{+}20, BBC^{+}23, x17, x14, GKRS22, GKR^{+}21, ARS^{+}15, GKL^{+}22, GHR^{+}23, GLR^{+}20]</em>. There also exists a claim for <span class="math">\\omega=1</span> <em>[x3, Appendix, Section 2.2.2.]</em>. In the literal meaning of <span class="math">\\omega</span>, i.e., as the linear algebra exponent, such choices might appear unrealistic. Implicitly, however, these choices aim to account for better-performing algorithms when dealing with structured matrices (such as sparse matrices) and use <span class="math">\\omega</span> as a shortcut for this aim.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In our analysis of Anemoi, we orientate ourselves by the choice <span class="math">\\omega=2</span>. Considering that our algebraic model of Anemoi yields an ideal in shape position, this choice seems to be justified. Indeed, in the literature, it is the shape position assumption that underlies fast algorithms for, e.g., Step (2) <em>[x12, x11]</em>. Nonetheless, we see the topic of a more detailed analysis of solving algorithms for Step (1) and Step (2) as an interesting and important open problem. Possibly, this helps to make more informed choices about the value of <span class="math">\\omega</span>.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-18" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2.2 Multihomogeneous Bézout Bound</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As seen in Section 2.1, a tight bound on the quotient space dimension <span class="math">d_{\\mathcal{I}}</span> of a zero-dimensional ideal <span class="math">\\mathcal{I}</span> is an important determinant for the complexity of Step (2) and Step (3) in Gröbner basis cryptanalysis.

    <h3 id="sec-22" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.1 Refined Methodology for Gröbner Basis Attacks</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Highly algebraic, round-based primitives such as Anemoi are prone to Gröbner basis attacks. The main goal of a Gröbner basis attack is to compute the reduced LEX Gröbner basis for a zero-dimensional ideal generated by a polynomial equation system modeling a given cryptographic primitive and, subsequently, factor the unique univariate polynomial in the reduced LEX Gröbner basis. We have outlined the individual steps of a Gröbner basis attack in Section 1.1 and discussed the respective complexities in Section 2.1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We present a refined version of the Gröbner basis attack methodology. In particular, we discuss and elaborate on the details of the individual steps of a Gröbner basis attack. Our methodology suggests two perspectives for each of the steps: a theoretical and an experimental perspective. In total, this leads to six perspectives (or ’worlds’) that a designer, as well as an attacker, may consider.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-23" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Modeling the Primitive.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Represent the round-based primitive as a system of <span class="math">n_{e}</span> polynomial equations over the underlying finite field in <span class="math">n_{v}</span> variables. For permutations, typically the so-called constrained-input constrained-output (CICO) problem is considered <em>[x1]</em>. To allow certain analysis strategies later on, it is advantageous to have an algebraic model where the number of equations <span class="math">n_{e}</span> equals the number of variables <span class="math">n_{v}</span> for every fixed round number <span class="math">N</span>.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-24" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Gröbner Basis Attack on Small-Scale Variants of the Primitive.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To gain insight into the hardness of the Gröbner basis attack, experiments are performed on weakened variants of the primitives. See also <em>[x10]</em> for a further discussion. This includes the reduction of the round number <span class="math">N</span> and the reduction of the state size by considering smaller finite fields. However, in some cases, it might be nontrivial to properly scale down a full-scale primitive to some small-scale variant that is tractable by practical experiments.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">When conducting experiments, several factors influence the performance of solving algorithms for Step (1), Step (2), and Step (3), besides the global choice of a particular algebraic model. In the case of Step (1), the monomial order as well as the variable order within this monomial order highly affect the runtime of a Gröbner basis computation. It is known that in extreme cases, a well-chosen monomial order directly yields a Gröbner basis (without any computation) <em>[x5, AAB^{+}20]</em>. In essence, this means that Step (1) can be skipped, leaving only Step (2) and Step (3) to deal with. For Step (2), a similar perspective arises: although the quotient space dimension <span class="math">d_{\\mathcal{I}}</span> is an invariant of the ideal, concrete experiments may help to understand the structure in the multiplication matrices, which also depends on the monomial order from which we convert to the LEX order. Therefore, as a step towards a more thorough analysis, we suggest exploring the influence of the monomial/variable order on the runtime of Step (1) and Step (2). For example, in our analysis on Anemoi in Section 4, we tested different variable orders and chose the most performant one for our security analysis.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Following our discussion of complexity estimates in Section 2.1, important metrics of interest during the experiments are the degree of regularity <span class="math">d_{\\text{reg}}</span>, the quotient space dimension <span class="math">d_{\\mathcal{I}}</span>, and the degree of the univariate polynomial in the reduced LEX Gröbner basis. We record the values of these metrics for different round numbers and establish a growth trend depending on the number of rounds. This approach provides empirical evidence for subsequent security arguments based on extrapolation. A comparison of concrete runtime results, moreover, allows for a first assessment of which step is the hardest one. We also suggest performing experiments over different field sizes to ensure that the derived results are robust and not only an artifact of a particular field choice.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-25" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Security Analysis.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For a targeted security level of <span class="math">s</span> bits, the number of rounds <span class="math">N</span> has to be chosen such that <span class="math">N\\geq N^{*}</span>, where</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">N^{*}=\\min\\left\\{N\\in\\mathbb{N}\\,:\\,\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{alg}}(N)\\geq 2^{s}\\right\\}.</span> (15)</p>

Section 2.1) of the corresponding step in the Gröbner basis attack. The (E) <em>experimental estimation</em> and (T) <em>theoretical approximation</em> of these determinants give rise to what we call the <em>six worlds of Gröbner basis cryptanalysis</em>. Our security analysis discusses different suggestions for <span class="math">N^{*}</span> when based on the hardness of solving Step (1), Step (2), and Step (3), respectively.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-26" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.2 Exploring the Six Worlds of Gröbner Basis Cryptanalysis</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the concrete instantiation of the complexities, different approaches can be taken:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li><em>Experimental approach</em>: Computing <span class="math">d_{\\text{reg}}</span> and <span class="math">d_{\\mathcal{I}}</span> is, in general, as difficult as computing the Gröbner basis. By performing Gröbner basis attacks on small-scale variants, <span class="math">d_{\\text{reg}}</span>, and <span class="math">d_{\\mathcal{I}}</span> are retrieved for round-reduced systems. Estimates can be made from these values for <span class="math">d_{\\text{reg}}</span> and <span class="math">d_{\\mathcal{I}}</span>. While in some cases, a clear structure evolves (see, for example, Conjecture 3 for <span class="math">d_{\\mathcal{I}}</span> in Anemoi), often only bounds or approximations based on very few data points can be given. From a designer’s perspective, it is common practice to use lower bounds, thus potentially underestimating the respective complexities and, in turn, overestimating <span class="math">N^{*}</span> as stated in Equation (15). On the other hand, an attacker might instead work with upper bounds or tight estimates using regression. Note that the experimental approach is highly limited by the number of available data points, and there is no certainty in whether the retrieved formulas hold for larger round numbers as well.</li>

      <li><em>Theoretical approach</em>: To overcome the limitations of the experimental approach, theoretical bounds for <span class="math">d_{\\text{reg}}</span> and <span class="math">d_{\\mathcal{I}}</span> can be used. Using theoretical upper bounds increases confidence in the results, at the cost of potentially overestimating the true complexity, and thus underestimating <span class="math">N^{<em>}</span>. In particular, any round number <span class="math">N</span> below <span class="math">N^{</em>}</span> is <em>proven to be insufficient</em> to reach the targeted security level in the corresponding step of the Gröbner basis attack, under the assumption that asymptotic constants can be ignored.</li>

    </ul>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li><em>GB</em>: For regular sequences, the degree of regularity <span class="math">d_{\\text{reg}}</span> is bounded by the so-called Macaulay bound <em>[x1]</em>, which can be easily computed from the degrees of the polynomials <span class="math">f_{i}</span> in the system:</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">d_{\\text{MAC}}=1+\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{c}}(\\deg\\left(f_{i}\\right)-1).</span> (16)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In practice, however, the assumption of regular sequences often does not hold, and the Macaulay bound might only serve as a rough indicator for <span class="math">d_{\\text{reg}}</span>. However, since it is one of the few available explicit bounds, recent design and attack papers tend to use the Macaulay bound in their security arguments <em>[ACG^{+}19, x11, AAB^{+}20, GKR^{+}21]</em>.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li><em>FGLM</em>: For a zero-dimensional ideal <span class="math">\\mathcal{I}</span>, the quotient space dimension <span class="math">d_{\\mathcal{I}}</span> is tightly connected to the variety <span class="math">V_{\\mathbb{F}}\\left(\\mathcal{I}\\right)</span> and thus to the number of solutions to the polynomial equation system (cf. Theorem 10). By inserting into the formula for <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{\\texttt{FGLM}}</span>, given in Equation (6), <span class="math">N^{*}</span> with respect to an a priori fixed security level of <span class="math">s</span> bits can be derived using</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">N^{*}=\\min\\left\\{N\\in\\mathbb{N}\\,:\\,n_{v}(N)\\cdot D(N)^{\\omega}\\geq 2^{s}\\right\\},</span> (17)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">n_{v}(N)</span> denotes the number of variables and <span class="math">D(N)</span> denotes the number of solutions to the system (over the algebraic closure, counted with multiplicities). If the considered system is square, <span class="math">D(N)</span> can be approximated using the theoretical Bézout bound. However, this bound is often loose because of many solutions at infinity, which leads to heavily underestimating the necessary number of rounds. Alternatively, the minimal multihomogeneous Bézout bound can be used instead, as it “takes advantage of the structure and leads to tighter complexity results” <em>[x1, Appendix]</em>. Below, we outline our heuristic approach to identify a variable set partition minimizing the multihomogeneous Bézout bound.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>FAC: The degree of the univariate polynomial in the reduced LEX Gröbner basis is bounded from above by the quotient space dimension <span class="math">d_{\\mathcal{I}}</span>. Notably, this bound is tight if the ideal is in shape position. Thus, theoretical bounds for <span class="math">d_{\\mathcal{I}}</span>, such as the Bézout bounds, can be used in the security analysis.</li>

    </ul>

    <h4 id="sec-27" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Heuristic Approach for Multihomogeneous Bézout.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To determine an “optimal” variable set partition, we use a heuristic approach in four steps.</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>Compute the multihomogeneous Bézout bound for all different variable set partitions for the round reduced instances and identify the optimal partition(s).</li>

      <li>Find a pattern in this partition(s), that is, variable groupings that consistently reappear when increasing the number of rounds <span class="math">N</span>.</li>

      <li>Extrapolate (one of) the “optimal” partition pattern(s) to the general case for arbitrary <span class="math">N\\geq 1</span>.</li>

      <li>Given an “optimal” partition pattern, derive an explicit formula for the multihomogeneous Bézout bound dependent on the number of rounds <span class="math">N</span>.</li>

    </ol>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This strategy seems appropriate, as variables and equations modeling round-based primitives are typically generated in a very structured way, thus likely maintaining the properties of a particular variable set partition. While there is no proof that the selected “optimal” partition pattern consistently yields the minimal multihomogenous Bézout bound, it still yields a bound at least as good as the classical Bézout bound.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-28" class="text-2xl font-bold">4 Algebraic Cryptanalysis of Anemoi</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This section presents our security analysis of Anemoi <em>[BBC+23]</em>, with a particular focus on prime fields. Section 4.1 recaps the essentials of the Anemoi design, Sections 4.2 to 4.5 follow the attack and analysis methodology outlined in Section 3.1.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-29" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.1 Design Description</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Anemoi <em>[BBC+23]</em> is a family of permutations that can be used as a building block for arithmetization-friendly hash functions. In particular, the designers suggest two modes of operation: the sponge mode, to turn the permutation into a hash function, and a mode of operation called Jive to turn the permutation into a compression function.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">By design, Anemoi operates over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2\\ell}</span>, for <span class="math">\\ell\\in\\mathbb{N}</span>, and either <span class="math">q=p</span> is an odd prime or <span class="math">q=2^{n}</span>, for <span class="math">n\\geq 10</span> odd. When used in a sponge construction, the designers argue that for sufficiently large fields, choosing <span class="math">\\ell=1</span> is enough <em>[BBC+23, Section 5.3]</em> to reach the security goals. We thus restrict the discussion to this special case. In each round <span class="math">r</span> of Anemoi <span class="math">:\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}\\to\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}</span>, the following steps are performed:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, we found that this is an artifact of the size of the chosen prime field. For larger primes, we observe a consistent degree of regularity. In particular, we tested  <span class="math">p \\in \\{2^{32} - 209, 2^{64} - 353, \\mathrm{BN}-254, \\mathrm{BLS12}-381\\}</span> , where the last two denote the scalar field of the respective elliptic curves. For the rest of this paper, we fix the variable ordering  <span class="math">o_1</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The presented results were achieved for Anemoi:  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p^2\\to \\mathbb{F}_p^2</span>  with  <span class="math">p\\in \\{2^{32} - 209,2^{64} - 353\\}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\alpha \\in \\{3,5\\}</span> . A more complete overview is given in Appendix C. In the following, we denote by  <span class="math">T_{\\mathrm{alg}}(\\cdot ,\\alpha)</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{alg}}(\\cdot ,\\alpha)</span>  the concrete execution time and bit complexity of a specific step in the Gröbner basis attack for a given model, respectively.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">During the experiments, we found that both ideals  <span class="math">\\langle \\mathcal{F}_{\\mathrm{CICO}}\\rangle</span>  and  <span class="math">\\langle \\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{CICO}}\\rangle</span>  were always in shape position (cf. Remark 1), having the same reduced LEX Gröbner basis. This means that both algebraic models of Anemoi exhibit a strong algebraic structure which might be further exploited with dedicated algorithms [BND22]. We also observed that the cost for the final factoring Step (3) in a Gröbner basis attack was negligible, which might be due to the very small number of solutions over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> , see Appendices C.1 and C.2. Hence, our comparison focuses on Step (1) and Step (2).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Regarding execution time, the FGLM step is the most involved part of the Gröbner basis attack. Interestingly, in the case  <span class="math">\\alpha = 5</span>  (cf. Figure 5a),  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{CICO}}</span>  performs better than  <span class="math">\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathrm{CICO}}</span> . Conversely, the experimental complexity  <span class="math">^6</span> <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{GB}}</span>  grows in general faster than  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{FGLM}}</span> . Interestingly,  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{GB}}(\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathrm{CICO}},\\alpha)</span>  grows much faster than  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{GB}}(\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{CICO}},\\alpha)</span> . Moreover,  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{GB}}(\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{CICO}},\\alpha)</span>  exhibits similar growth than  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{FGLM}}(\\cdot ,\\alpha)</span> , at least for small round numbers.

    <p class="text-gray-300">In summary, the runtime results indicate that Step (2) FGLM is more challenging compared to Step (1) GB, contrary to the estimated complexities which suggest the opposite. There are several possible explanations for this phenomenon:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>To the best of our knowledge, MAGMA implements the original FGLM basis conversion with a runtime of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}\\left(n_v\\cdot d_{\\mathcal{I}}^3\\right)</span> , whereas complexities were derived using  <span class="math">\\omega = 2</span> . Additionally, these complexities are measured in terms of finite field operations, whose actual execution time can vary depending on the specific operation.</li>

      <li>Relying on asymptotic complexity bounds for derivation may overlook factors that vary based on the specific problem, introducing potential limitations to the analysis.</li>

      <li>Memory management might highly influence the concrete timing results.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since the overall complexity of a Gröbner basis attack is determined by the dominant step (cf. Section 2.1), we extrapolate the observed metrics to gain insight for larger round numbers, which is of common practice in the field of Gröbner basis cryptanalysis. Note that using conjectured metrics for the complexity estimates introduces an unclear heuristic gap, potentially leading to over- or underestimation. Thus, we additionally investigate theoretical (upper) bounds.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This section establishes conjectures and theoretical bounds on the metrics that govern the three steps of a Gröber basis attack. The results will be used in Section 4.5 to derive round numbers in all six worlds. Proofs for almost all theoretical bounds are given in Appendix B.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the following, we argue that the margins in Equation (46) and, for certain instances, the suggested round numbers (cf.  <span class="math">\\mathrm{[BBC^{+}23}</span> , Table 1]) might not be sufficient. In particular, we derive round numbers using the formula in Equation (15), restated here for simplicity:</p>

Subsequently, we interpret our findings in the context of the Six Worlds of Gröbner Basis Cryptanalysis and compare them with the suggested round numbers.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Interpretation. Under the assumption that none of the steps in the Gröbner basis attack are trivial, the six worlds are interpreted as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(T) In the theoretical world, round numbers below the given values are proven to be insecure since they evidently do not reach the asserted security level against a particular step in the Gröbner basis attack. Implicitly, this also yields a lower bound on the number of rounds. (E) In the experimental world, results are to be understood as a lower bound on the number of rounds to reach the targeted security level against a particular step in the Gröbner basis attack.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the particular case of Anemoi, only Step (1)  <span class="math">GB</span>  computation and Step (2)  <span class="math">FGLM</span>  basis conversion seem to be of practical importance in the security assessment. For example, in the concrete case of Anemoi:  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p^2 \\to \\mathbb{F}_p^2</span>  with  <span class="math">\\alpha = 3</span>  and a target security level of  <span class="math">s = 128</span>  bits using the model  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{CICO}}</span> , the different worlds can be interpreted as follows (see Figure 8) for  <span class="math">\\omega = 2</span>  (2.37):</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Step (1) GB: A round number below 22 (19) is insufficient to reach the targeted security level.

    <p class="text-gray-300">First, note that a security margin of 2 rounds, as described in Equation (46), is clearly not enough to account for the more complex model  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{CICO}}</span> . For some instances, there is a difference of up to 14 rounds for the round numbers derived from  <span class="math">\\mathcal{F}_{\\mathrm{CICO}}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{CICO}}</span> . Second, the dominance of Step (1) over Step (2), as claimed in  <span class="math">[\\mathrm{BBC}^{+}23]</span> , remains unclear. As experimental runtime results indicate the opposite, considering higher round numbers derived from  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{FGLM}}</span>  might be prudent. For many instances, the results in (T2) show that the suggested round numbers cannot provide the targeted security level.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As expected, the highest round numbers are derived from the (E) experimental world. Notably, there is one instance for which the round numbers in both (E1) and (E2) lie clearly above the suggestion:  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{CICO}}</span>  for  <span class="math">\\alpha = 3</span>  and  <span class="math">s = 256</span> . Table 8 shows the estimated attack complexity for this instance, that is, the complexities that result when inserting the suggested 37 rounds into the different complexity formulas. Indeed, for  <span class="math">\\omega = 2</span> , the estimated attack complexity is below the targeted 256 bits in the experimental world. In this context, the theoretical results indicate that for the given round number, the complexity will not be above the derived value.

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the previous discussions, we concentrated on the case  <span class="math">\\omega = 2</span>  for the linear algebra constant. While this choice is generally considered conservative from a designer's perspective, it might seem rather aggressive for an attacker. Nevertheless, we think this choice is still suitable due to the internal structures of the polynomial systems. As discussed in Section 2.1, a very aggressive choice would be  <span class="math">\\omega = 1</span> , accounting for algorithms exploiting structure in the polynomial equation system. In this case, the number of rounds would need to be increased significantly. See Section 3.2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Besides simply increasing the number of rounds, another strategy to address the newly identified vulnerabilities is to select a larger exponent for  <span class="math">Q_{\\delta}</span>  and  <span class="math">Q_{\\gamma}</span> . Specifically, if  <span class="math">\\deg(Q_{\\delta}) = \\deg(Q_{\\gamma}) &amp;gt; 2</span> , the polynomial degrees in  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{CICO}}</span>  will demonstrate exponential growth instead of solely linear growth. The practical performance influence of the two approaches might depend on the concrete use case.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">5 Conclusion</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We presented a refined methodology aimed at providing a broader understanding of Gröbner basis cryptanalysis. Central to our approach is the introduction of the Six Worlds of Gröbner Basis Cryptanalysis, which integrates both theoretical and experimental dimensions applied to the classical three steps of a Gröbner basis attack.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A concrete application of our methodology is demonstrated through the analysis of Anemoi. Detailed analyses of the <span class="math">\\mathcal{F}_{\\text{CICO}}</span> and <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{CICO}}</span> models, as described in <em>[BBC+23]</em>, allowed us to derive precise bounds and formulate conjectures concerning the metrics that govern the attack complexity. In particular, by leveraging the multihomogeneous Bézout bound for <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_{\\text{CICO}}</span> to obtain a tighter upper bound on the quotient space dimension, we identified specific instances of Anemoi that may be susceptible to Gröbner basis attacks.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our “Six Worlds” framework facilitates a granular assessment of the security of individual attack steps. Specifically, it enables the identification of round number thresholds below which a particular step may be considered insecure for a given security level (the theoretical dimension) and provides round number recommendations (the experimental dimension). Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of employing more precise upper bounds, like those provided by the multihomogeneous Bézout bound, to enhance the quality of theoretical results.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In summary, the presented approach provides designers with a robust tool for evaluating and understanding the security implications of each step of a Gröbner basis attack.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-48" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Open Problems.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A natural question to ask is the following: Given that the new methods lead to new results on Anemoi, could other designs that exhibit similar properties, such as Griffin <em>[GHR+23]</em> or Arion <em>[x20]</em>, and perhaps to a lesser extent also Poseidon <em>[GKR+21]</em> or Rescue <em>[AAB+20]</em> be affected? Also beyond the area of arithmetization-friendly hashing, there are potential targets, e.g., big-field FHE-friendly permutation-based symmetric encryption <em>[DGH+23, HKC+20, HKL+22]</em>, and MPC-friendly big field designs <em>[GLR+20, AGR+16, x1, x12]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Furthermore, studying more dedicated Gröbner basis algorithms that exploit structures within algebraic systems may prove valuable. This approach could yield tighter upper bounds, potentially meaningful lower bounds, and provide a clearer understanding of the actual solving complexity.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-53" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">A.1 Gröbner Basis Preliminaries</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We present an outline of essential results in the context of solving equation systems with Gröbner basis techniques. Equation systems stemming from problems in symmetric cryptography most often have a finite number of solutions (over the algebraic closure). Expressed in commutative algebra lingo, this means the equation system generates a zero-dimensional ideal. While some of the more general results in this section are valid for any ideal, we are primarily interested in the zero-dimensional case. One major focus point of our outline deals with bounds on the number of solutions of (zero-dimensional) equation systems and, in that capacity, discusses the classical Bézout bound. This discussion prepares the ground for our motivation of the multihomogeneous Bézout bound.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For a more comprehensive introduction to background results, we recommend the excellent textbooks <em>[x10, x22, x23]</em>.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-54" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">A.1.1 Notation</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the following, <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span> denotes a field, and <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span> is a finite field. In general, we use <span class="math">R=\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}]</span> to denote the polynomial ring over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span> in the <span class="math">n</span> indeterminates <span class="math">x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}</span>. Sometimes, it is convenient to emphasize the connection between the number of variables <span class="math">n_{v}</span> in an equation system and the polynomial ring over which this system lives. In this case, we presume to write <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}[x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n_{v}}]</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">From a geometric perspective, the set of solutions to an equation system defined by <span class="math">m</span> polynomials over a field in <span class="math">n</span> variables</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">f_{1}(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n})=\\cdots=f_{m}(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n})=0,</span> (47)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">is given by the <em>variety</em> of the ideal generated by <span class="math">f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m}</span>.</p>

    <h6 id="sec-55" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Definition 2 (Affine variety).</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">m,n\\in\\mathbb{N}</span>, and let <span class="math">\\mathcal{I}=\\langle f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m}\\rangle</span> be an ideal in <span class="math">R</span>. The set</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">V(\\mathcal{I})=V(f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m})\\coloneqq\\left\\{z\\in A^{n}\\left(\\mathbb{F}\\right)\\,:\\,f_{i}\\left(z\\right)=0\\,\\,\\,\\forall\\,1\\leq i\\leq m\\right\\}</span> (48)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">is called the <em>affine variety</em> of the ideal <span class="math">\\mathcal{I}</span>, where <span class="math">A^{n}\\left(\\mathbb{F}\\right)=\\mathbb{F}^{n}</span> denotes the <span class="math">n</span>-dimensional affine space over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span>. For any field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}^{\\prime}</span> with <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}\\subset\\mathbb{F}^{\\prime}</span> we denote by <span class="math">V_{\\mathbb{F}^{\\prime}}\\left(\\mathcal{I}\\right)</span> the set of solutions over <span class="math">A^{n}\\left(\\mathbb{F}^{\\prime}\\right)</span>. In particular, <span class="math">V_{\\widehat{\\mathbb{F}}}\\left(\\mathcal{I}\\right)</span> denotes the variety of <span class="math">\\mathcal{I}</span> over the algebraic closure <span class="math">\\widehat{\\mathbb{F}}</span> of <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The variety of an ideal is independent of the actual choice of the generating set, i.e., if <span class="math">\\mathcal{I}=\\langle f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m}\\rangle=\\langle g_{1},\\ldots,g_{k}\\rangle</span>, then <span class="math">V(f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m})=V(g_{1},\\ldots,g_{k})</span>. To reason about <span class="math">V(\\mathcal{I})</span>, switching to a different generating set of the ideal is often advantageous. One important subclass of generating sets is the class of <em>Gröbner bases</em>.</p>

    <h6 id="sec-56" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Definition 3 (Gröbner basis).</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">\\mathcal{I}=\\langle f_{1},\\ldots,f_{m}\\rangle\\subset R</span> be an ideal. A <em>Gröbner basis</em> for <span class="math">\\mathcal{I}</span> with respect to a fixed monomial ordering <span class="math">\\succ</span> is a subset <span class="math">\\mathrm{G}=\\{g_{1},\\ldots,g_{t}\\}\\subseteq\\mathcal{I}</span> with the property</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\left\\langle\\mathrm{L}\\mathrm{m}\\left(g_{1}\\right),\\ldots,\\mathrm{L}\\mathrm{m}\\left(g_{t}\\right)\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle\\mathrm{L}\\mathrm{m}\\left(\\mathcal{I}\\right)\\right\\rangle,</span> (49)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">\\mathrm{L}\\mathrm{m}\\left(\\cdot\\right)</span> denotes the largest monomial (also called leading monomial) of a polynomial with respect to <span class="math">\\succ</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">8In particular, this is also the case for our algebraic model of Anemoi.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">9If an equation system generates a zero-dimensional ideal, we also informally say the equation system itself is zero-dimensional.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Katharina Koschatko, Reinhard Lüftenegger and Christian Rechberger</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Two of the most prominent monomial orderings in practice are the lexicographic (LEX) and the degree reverse lexicographic (DRL) ordering, see [CLO15]. For every nonzero ideal <span class="math">\\mathcal{I} \\subset R</span> and every fixed monomial ordering <span class="math">\\succ</span> there exists a unique reduced Gröbner basis <span class="math">G</span>. Here, reduced means that every <span class="math">g \\in G</span> is monic and no monomial of <span class="math">g</span> is divisible by any of <span class="math">\\mathrm{LM}(G \\setminus \\{g\\})</span>. An important property of Gröbner bases is that polynomial division modulo a Gröbner basis yields unique division remainders, see [CLO15, §6, Prop. 1]. This, in turn, allows us to uniquely represent residue classes in the quotient ring <span class="math">R / \\mathcal{I}</span> by division remainders modulo <span class="math">G</span>, where <span class="math">G</span> is a Gröbner basis of <span class="math">\\mathcal{I}</span>. Moreover, a Gröbner basis <span class="math">G</span> allows us to compute residue classes in the quotient ring by computing division remainders modulo <span class="math">G</span>. In a more technical speech, a Gröbner basis <span class="math">G</span> of the ideal <span class="math">\\mathcal{I}</span> defines an isomorphism of rings</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">R \\bmod G</span> denotes the ring of all division remainders modulo <span class="math">G</span> of elements in <span class="math">R</span>. The quotient ring <span class="math">R / \\mathcal{I}</span> is an <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span>-vector space, called the quotient space.

    <p class="text-gray-300">We present an outline of the proof of Theorem 1 since we deem it insightful for our later motivation of the multihomogeneous Bézout bound.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Proof Sketch.</strong> Denote by <span class="math">f_i^{\\mathrm{H}}</span> the homogenization of <span class="math">f_i</span> for every <span class="math">1 \\leq i \\leq n</span>, i.e.,</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">f_i^{\\mathrm{H}}(x_0, \\dots, x_n) := x_0^{d_i} \\cdot f_i\\left( \\frac{x_1}{x_0}, \\dots, \\frac{x_n}{x_0} \\right) \\in \\mathbb{F}^{\\mathrm{H}}[x_0, \\dots, x_n].</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Given <span class="math">f_i^{\\mathrm{H}}</span>, the original polynomial <span class="math">f_i</span> can be recovered by setting <span class="math">x_0 = 1</span>:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">f_i^{\\mathrm{H}}(1, x_1, \\dots, x_n) = f_i(x_1, \\dots, x_n).</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Thus, every affine solution <span class="math">a = (a_1, \\ldots, a_n) \\in V_{\\mathbb{F}}(\\mathcal{I})</span> corresponds to a projective solution <span class="math">[1: a_1: \\dots: a_n] \\in \\mathbb{P}^n(\\bar{\\mathbb{F}})</span> to the system defined by the homogeneous polynomials <span class="math">f_1^{\\mathrm{H}}, \\ldots, f_n^{\\mathrm{H}} \\in \\mathbb{F}^{\\mathrm{H}}[x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_n]</span>. Conversely, every projective solution in <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}^n(\\bar{\\mathbb{F}})</span> to the homogeneous polynomial equation system <span class="math">f_1^{\\mathrm{H}} = \\dots = f_n^{\\mathrm{H}} = 0</span> with <span class="math">x_0 = 1</span> recovers an affine solution of the original system. Naturally, projective solutions with <span class="math">x_0 \\neq 0</span> are called affine or finite, while those with <span class="math">x_0 = 0</span> are called solutions at infinity.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof Sketch. The multihomogeneous Bézout bound is given by the coefficient of  <span class="math">t_1^{n_1} \\cdots t_m^{n_m}</span>  in the product of linear forms, that is,</p>

Since we already picked column  <span class="math">j_{1}</span>  in the first step, the remaining number of selections for the  <span class="math">j_{1}</span> -th column is  <span class="math">n_j - 1</span> . This is equivalent to solving the original problem on the minor corresponding to  <span class="math">d_{1,j_1}</span> .

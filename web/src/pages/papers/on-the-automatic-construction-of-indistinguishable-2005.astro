    <p class="text-gray-300">Abstract. An increasingly important design constraint for software running on ubiquitous computing devices is security, particularly against physical methods such as side-channel attack. One well studied methodology for defending against such attacks is the concept of indistinguishable functions which leak no information about program control flow since all execution paths are computationally identical. However, the constructing such functions by hand is laborious and error prone as their complexity increases. We investigate techniques for automating this process and find that effective solutions can be constructed with only minor amounts of computational effort.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">1 Introduction</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As computing devices become increasingly ubiquitous, the task of writing software for them has presented programmers with a number of problems. Firstly, devices like smart-cards are highly constrained in both their computational and storage capacity; due to their low unit cost and small size, such devices are significantly less powerful than PDA or desktop class computers. This demands selection and implementation of algorithms which are sensitive to the demands of the platform. Coupled with these issues of efficiency, which are also prevalent in normal software development, constrained devices present new problems for the programmer. For example, one typically needs to consider the power characteristics and communication frequency of any operation since both eat into the valuable battery life of the device.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Perhaps the most challenging aspect of writing software for ubiquitous computers is the issue of security. Performing computation in a hostile, adversarial</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">environment demands that software is robust enough to repel attackers who hope to retrieve data stored on the device. Although cryptography provides a number of tools to aid in protecting the data, the advent of physical attacks such as side-channel analysis and fault injection mean one needs to consider security of the software implementation as well as the mathematics it implements. By passive monitoring of execution features such as timing variations <em>[14]</em>, power consumption <em>[15]</em> or electromagnetic emission <em>[1, 2]</em> attackers can remotely recover secret information from a device with little fear of detection. Typically attacks consist of a collection phase which provides the attacker with profiles of execution, and an analysis phase which recovers the secret information from the profiles. Considering power consumption as the collection medium from here on, attack methods can be split into two main classes. Simple power analysis (SPA) is where the attacker is given only one profile and is required to recover the secret information by focusing mainly on the operation being executed. In contrast, differential power analysis (DPA) uses statistical methods to form a corelation between a number of profiles and the secret information by focusing mainly on the data items being processed.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As attack methods have become better understood, so have the related defense methods. Although new vulnerabilities are regularly uncovered, one can now deploy techniques in hardware and software which will vastly reduce the effectiveness of most side-channel attacks and do so with fairly minor overhead. Very roughly, defense methods fall into one of two main categories:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One method of reducing the chance of leaking secret information is to introduce a confusion or randomisation element into the algorithm being executed. This is particularly effective in defending against DPA-style attacks but may also be useful in the SPA-style case. Essentially, randomisation ensures the execution sequence and intermediate results are different for every invocation and hence reduces the correlation of a given profile with the secret information. This method exists in many different forms, for example the addition of blinding factors to exponents; dynamically randomising the parameters or control flow in exponentiation algorithms; and using redundant representations. To prevent leakage of secret information to an SPA-style attack by revealing the algorithm control flow, this approach aims to modify operations sequences so that every execution path is uniform. Again, there are several ways in which this can be achieved. One way is to work directly on the mathematical formulae that define the operations and modify them so that the resulting implementations have identical structure. Another method is to work directly on the code, rearranging it and inserting dummy operations, to obtain the same effect.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A key difference between issues of efficiency and security is that the programmer is assisted by a compiler in the former case but not in the later. That is, the programmer is entirely responsible for constructing defense methods against side-channel analysis. Although the general technique of creating indistinguishable</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">functions to foil SPA style attack is well understood; the general barrier to implementation is how labour intensive and error prone the process is. This is especially true when operation sequences in the functions are more complex than in the stock example of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), for example systems like XTR or hyperelliptic curve cryptography (HECC). However, the task is ideally suited to automation; to this end our focus in this paper is the realisation of such automation to assist the development of secure software. In the rest of this Section we introduce the concept and use of indistinguishable functions in more detail and present an overview of related work. Then, in Section 2 we describe the construction of such functions as an optimisation problem and offer an algorithm to produce solutions in Section 3. Finally, we present some example results in Section 4 and concluding remarks in Section 5.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1.1 Using Indistinguishable Functions</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One of the most basic forms of side-channel attack is that of simple power analysis (SPA): the attacker is presented with a single profile from the collection phase and tasked with recovering the secret information. Such an attack can succeed if one can reconstruct the program control flow by observing the operations performed in an algorithm. If decisions in the control flow are based on secret information, it is leaked to the attacker. Because it represents an ideal partner for constrained devices, we focus here on point multiplication as used in ECC <em>[3]</em> and described by Algorithm 1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Restricting ourselves to working over the field <span class="math">K=\\mathbb{F}_{p}</span>, where <span class="math">p</span> is a large prime, our elliptic curve is defined by:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">E(K):y^{2}=x^{3}+Ax+B</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">for some parameters <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span>. The set of rational points <span class="math">P=(x,y)</span> on this curve, together with the identity element <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}</span>, form an additive group. ECC based public key cryptography typically derives security by presenting an intractable discrete logarithm problem over this curve group. That is, one constructs a secret integer <span class="math">d</span> and performs the operation <span class="math">Q=d\\cdot P</span> for some public point <span class="math">P</span>. Since reversing</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">this operation is hard, one can then transmit <span class="math">Q</span> without revealing the value of <span class="math">d</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since one is composed from a different sequence of field operations than the other, point addition and doubling operations will be distinguishable from each other in a profile of power consumption. Denoting addition by <span class="math">A</span> and doubling by <span class="math">D</span>, the collection phase presents the attacker with a profile detailing the operations performed during execution of the algorithm. For example, by monitoring execution of using the multiplier <span class="math">d=1001_{2}=9_{10}</span>, one obtains the profile:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">DADDDA</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Given this single profile, the analysis phase can recover the secret value of <span class="math">d</span> simply by spotting where the point additions occur: if an addition occurs then <span class="math">d_{i}=1</span>, otherwise <span class="math">d_{i}=0</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One way to avoid this problem is to employ a double-and-add-always method, due to Coron <em>[7]</em>, whereby a dummy addition is executed if the real one is not. Although the cases where <span class="math">d_{i}=0</span> and <span class="math">d_{i}=1</span> are now indistinguishable, this method significantly reduces the performance of the algorithm since many more additions are performed.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, the ECC group law is very flexible in terms of how the point addition and doubling operations can be implemented through different curve parameterisations, point representations and so on. We can utilise this flexibility to consider forcing indistinguishability by manipulating the functions for point addition and doubling so that they are no longer different. This is generally achieved by splitting the more expensive point addition into two parts, each of which is identical in terms of the operations it performs to a point doubling. Put more simply, instead of recovering the profile above from the SPA collection phase, an attacker gets:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">DDDDDDDD</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">from which they can get no useful information. Note that although we present the use of indistinguishable functions solely for point multiplication or exponentiation, the technique is more generally useful and can be applied in many other contexts.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1.2 Related Work</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Gebotys and Gebotys <em>[11]</em> analyse the SPA resistance of a DSP-based implementation of ECC point multiplication using projective coordinates on curves over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p}</span>. They show that by hand-modifying the doubling and adding implementation code, simply by inserting dummy operations, it is possible to obtain significant improvements. Likewise, Trichina and Bellezza <em>[20]</em> analyse the overhead associated with the same approach using mixed coordinates on curves over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{n}}</span>, and again find an efficient hand-constructed solution. Brier and Joye <em>[5]</em> present unified addition and doubling functions by observing that operations for calculating slope can be shared between the two cases. Joye and Quisquater <em>[13]</em> and Liard</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and Smart <em>[17]</em> take a different approach by finding different curve parameterisations that offer naturally indistinguishable formula; they utilise Hessian and Jacobi form elliptic curves respectively.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In other contexts than ECC, Page and Stam <em>[19]</em> present hand-constructed indistinguishable operations for XTR.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Chevallier-Mames et al. <em>[6]</em> propose a generalised formulation for constructing indistinguishable functions and apply it to processor-level sequences of instructions. SPA attacks typically exploit conditional instructions that depend on secret information: the solution is to make the sequences of instructions (processes) associated with both branches indistinguishable. The authors introduce the concept of side channel atomicity: all processes are transformed, simply by padding them with dummy operations, so that they execute as a repetition of a small instruction sequence (a pattern) called a side-channel atomic block.</p>

      <li>Throughout the algorithm, the pattern  <span class="math">\\varPi</span>  is adjusted to each solution by taking  <span class="math">\\varPi[k]</span>  as the most common basic instruction in column  <span class="math">k</span>  of the matrix.</li>

      <li>A dummy instruction is always taken to be of the same type as the pattern instruction for its particular column, so dummy instructions are ignored when adjusting  <span class="math">\\varPi</span>  to a particular solution.</li>

      <li>The overall cost of a solution has two components:  <span class="math">c</span>  and  <span class="math">d</span> . The former is the cost associated with deviations from the pattern and it is evaluated as the sum, taken over all non-matching instructions in the matrix, of the weight difference relative to the corresponding pattern instruction. The latter is the cost associated with dummy operations and it is evaluated as the accumulated weight of all the dummy instructions in the matrix.</li>

      <li>The relative importance of these components can be tuned to put more or less emphasis on indistinguishability. This affects the trade-off between indistinguishability and processing overhead.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Throughout its execution, the algorithm keeps track of the best solution it has been able to reach (lines 19 to 22); this is returned when the algorithm terminates (line 24).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A neighbour solution is derived from the current solution by randomly selecting one of the following heuristics:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A function <span class="math">F_{i}^{\\prime}</span> is selected randomly, and its instructions are all moved as far to the left as possible, filling spaces previously occupied by dummy instructions or just freed by moving other instructions. The order of the instructions is preserved, and an instruction is only moved if it matches the pattern instruction for the target column. Same as previous, only that instructions are shifted to the right. A function <span class="math">F_{i}^{\\prime}</span> is selected randomly, and an instruction <span class="math">F_{i}^{\\prime}[j]</span> is randomly picked within it. This instruction is then moved as far to the left as possible. An instruction is only moved if this does not violate inter-instruction dependencies, and it matches the pattern instruction for the target column. Same as previous, only that the instruction is shifted to the right.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">After application of the selection heuristic, the neighbour solution is optimised by removing rows or columns containing only dummy instructions. If the final solution produced by Algorithm 4 includes deviations from the chosen pattern, these can be eliminated by extending the pattern to get a totally indistinguishable result. If the number of mismatches is large, this produces a degenerate solution. We have implemented this as an optional post-processing functionality.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our experimental results indicate the following rules of thumb that should be considered when parameterising Algorithm 4:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li><span class="math">S</span> should be at least half of the length of the longest function.</li>

      <li><span class="math">T</span> should be a small multiple of the total number of instructions.</li>

      <li>An overall cost function calculated as <span class="math">c^{2}+d</span> leads to a good compromise between indistinguishability and processing overhead.</li>

      <li>The threshold should decrease quadratically, starting at 70% for <span class="math">t=0</span> and reaching 10% when <span class="math">t=T-1</span>.</li>

      <li>The neighbour generation heuristics should be selected with equal probability, or with a small bias favoring moving over tilting mutations.</li>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Appendix 3 includes indistinguishable versions of hyper-elliptic curve point adding and doubling functions. These implementations correspond to the general case of the explicit formulae for genus 2 hyperelliptic curves over finite fields using affine coordinates. provided by Lange in [16]. A pseudo-code implementation of these formulae is also included in Appendix 3. In our analysis, we made no assumptions as to the values of curve parameters because our objective was to work over a relatively large problem instance. Operations involving curve parameters were treated as generic operations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this example, the group operations themselves contain branching instructions. To accommodate this, we had to first create indistinguishable versions of the smaller branches inside the addition and doubling functions, separately. The process was then applied globally to the two main branches of the addition function and to the doubling function as a whole, which meant processing three functions of considerable size, simultaneously.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Defense against side-channel attacks is a vital part of engineering software that is to be executed on constrained devices. Since such devices are used within an adversarial environment, sound and efficient techniques are of value even if they are hard to implement. To this end we have investigated an automated approach to constructing indistinguishable functions, a general method of defense against certain classes of side-channel attack which are notoriously difficult to implement as the functions grow more complex. Our results show that efficient versions of such functions, which are competitive with hand-constructed versions, can be generated with only minor computational effort.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This work is pitched in the context of cryptography-aware compilation: the idea that programmers should be assisted in describing secure software just like they are offered support to optimise software. We have embedded our algorithm in such a compiler which can now automatically manipulate a source program so the result is more secure.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figures 8 and 9 show indistinguishable versions of hyper-elliptic curve point adding and doubling functions. These implementations correspond to the explicit formulae for genus 2 hyperelliptic curves over finite fields provided by Lange in [16]. Figure 7 contains a pseudo-code implementation of these formulae.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 6 clarifies the relationship between Figures 7, 8 and 9. Note that variable s11 in the pseudo-code implementation becomes variable s116 in Figures 8 and 9. Note also that, whatever the execution path that occurs, indistinguishability is maintained across all possible variants.</p>

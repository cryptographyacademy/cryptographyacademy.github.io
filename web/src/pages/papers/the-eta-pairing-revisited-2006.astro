    <p class="text-gray-300">Abstract. In this paper we simplify and extend the Eta pairing, originally discovered in the setting of supersingular curves by Barreto et al., to ordinary curves. Furthermore, we show that by swapping the arguments of the Eta pairing, one obtains a very efficient algorithm resulting in a speed-up of a factor of around six over the usual Tate pairing, in the case of curves which have large security parameters, complex multiplication by an order of Q( √ −3), and when the trace of Frobenius is chosen to be suitably small. Other, more minor savings are obtained for more general curves. 1 2</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A bilinear pairing (or simply pairing) is a map of the form</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\hat{t}: \\mathbb{G}_1 \\times \\mathbb{G}_2 \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{G}_T</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where G1, G&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are additive groups and G&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is a multiplicative group. By bilinear we mean that the map is linear in each component, i.e.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We only consider pairings, between groups of large prime order r, which are non-degenerate, i.e. for which there exists  <span class="math">P \\in \\mathbb{G}_1</span>  and  <span class="math">Q \\in \\mathbb{G}_2</span>  such that  <span class="math">\\hat{t}(P,Q) \\neq 1</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Pairings on elliptic curves have, in recent years, become of great research interest in the cryptographic community. This is due to their application in a number of protocols with cryptographic functionality that cannot be achieved using other mathematical primitives, e.g. [6, 7, 16].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Traditionally two types of pairings have been considered, the Weil pairing and the Tate pairing. It is now accepted that for general curves providing common levels of security, the Tate pairing is more efficient, [14, 19]. However, other related pairings are available which in certain situations are more efficient, for example the Eta-pairing [1] on certain supersingular elliptic curves, which in itself extended and optimized the Duursma-Lee techniques introduced in [9].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper we present a new pairing, which is closely related to the Etapairing but which can be used efficiently with ordinary elliptic curves. In addition we show that for the types of curves for which our new pairing applies, one achieves further performance improvements due to the fact that one can represent the group  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span>  more efficiently than one can normally.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We call our new pairing the Ate pairing, pronounced <em>eight</em>. This is for two reasons, firstly it is like the Tate pairing, but faster (hence the missing 'T'), it is also like the Eta pairing but it reverses the order of the arguments (and Ate is Eta spelled backwards).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Much of the results in this paper are based on the use of properties of twists of elliptic curves. Many of the results we use are well known to the experts, but we have been unable to locate them in the literature. Hence, we will also present these results related to twists.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-2" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">2 Background on Tate Pairing</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This section briefly recalls the definition of the Tate pairing and sets notation used in the remainder of the paper. An excellent survey of pairings can be found in [11].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  be a finite field with  <span class="math">q=p^n</span>  elements where p is prime and let E be an elliptic curve defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> . Consider a large prime r such that  <span class="math">r\\mid \\#E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span>  and denote the embedding degree by k, i.e. the smallest positive integer such that r divides  <span class="math">q^k-1</span> . For technical reasons we assume that  <span class="math">r^2</span>  does not divide  <span class="math">q^k-1</span> , which is not a problem in practice. The embedding degree k is chosen in this way so as to ensure that the full r-torsion E[r] of the elliptic curve is defined over the field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}</span> , i.e.  <span class="math">E[r] \\subset E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^k})</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">P \\in E[r]</span>  and  <span class="math">Q \\in E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^k})</span> , and consider the divisor D = (Q + R) - (R) with R a random point in  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^k})</span> . For every integer s, let  <span class="math">f_{s,P}</span>  be a function with divisor</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(f_{s,P}) = s(P) - ([s]P) - (s-1)\\mathcal{O},</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">then the Tate pairing is a well-defined, non-degenerate, bilinear pairing</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle_r : \\left\\{ \\begin{aligned} E[r] \\times E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}) / r E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}) &amp;\\to &amp; \\mathbb{F}_{q^k}^* / (\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}^*)^r \\\\ (P, Q) &amp;\\mapsto \\langle P, Q \\rangle_r = f_{r,P}(D). \\end{aligned} \\right.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The output of this pairing is only defined up to a coset of  <span class="math">(\\mathbb{F}_{a^k}^*)^r</span> , however for protocols we will require a unique element of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}^*</span> . Hence to obtain a unique representative, one defines the reduced Tate pairing as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$e(P,Q) = \\langle P, Q \\rangle_r^{(q^k - 1)/r} = f_{r,P}(D)^{(q^k - 1)/r} \\in \\mathbb{G}_T.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is not difficult to show [2] that if k &gt; 1 one can in fact ignore working with the divisor D and simply work with the point Q, i.e. one can define the reduced Tate pairing as  <span class="math">e(P,Q) = f_{r,P}(Q)^{(q^k-1)/r}</span> . A second useful property [12] is that r can be replaced by any integer N such that  <span class="math">r \\mid N \\mid q^k - 1</span> , i.e.  <span class="math">e(P,Q) = f_{N,P}(Q)^{(q^k-1)/N}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To compute the function  <span class="math">f_{s,P}</span>  for s&gt;0, one can simply use Miller's algorithm [17]. For s &lt; 0 it suffices to remark that  <span class="math">(f_{s,P}) = -(f_{-s,P}) - (v_{sP})</span>  with  <span class="math">v_{sP}</span>  the vertical line through sP, so we can take  <span class="math">f_{s,P} = 1/(f_{-s,P}v_{sP})</span> . If k is even, then  <span class="math">v_{sP}</span>  can be ignored due to the final powering operation.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-3" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">The Ate Pairing 3</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we introduce the Ate pairing and show that it extends and simplifies the Eta pairing introduced in [1]. Indeed, the conditions stated in [1, Theorem 1] are in fact automatically satisfied.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Although the Tate pairing as defined in the previous section allows arguments  <span class="math">P \\in E[r]</span>  and  <span class="math">Q \\in E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^k})</span> , in practice one often works with specific subgroups to speed-up the pairing computation. Let  <span class="math">\\pi_q</span>  be the Frobenius endomorphism, i.e.  <span class="math">\\pi_q: E \\to E: (x,y) \\mapsto (x^q,y^q)</span> , then the following choice seems to be optimal:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>the group  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1 = E[r] \\cap \\operatorname{Ker}(\\pi_q - [1]),</span> - the group  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2 = E[r] \\cap \\operatorname{Ker}(\\pi_q - [q]).</span></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Although in practice one has always used the Tate pairing on  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1 \\times \\mathbb{G}_2</span> , from a theoretical point of view, the Tate pairing on  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2 \\times \\mathbb{G}_1</span>  has a much nicer structure.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-4" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">The Ate Pairing on <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2 \\times \\mathbb{G}_1</span></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The main result of this section is summarised in the following theorem.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 1.</strong> Let E be an elliptic curve over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> , r a large prime with  <span class="math">r \\mid \\#E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span> and denote the trace of Frobenius with t, i.e.  <span class="math">\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_q) = q+1-t</span> . For T=t-1,  <span class="math">Q \\in \\mathbb{G}_2 = E[r] \\cap \\operatorname{Ker}(\\pi_q - [q])</span>  and  <span class="math">P \\in \\mathbb{G}_1 = E[r] \\cap \\operatorname{Ker}(\\pi_q - [1])</span> , we have the following:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li><span class="math">-f_{T,Q}(P)</span>  defines a bilinear pairing, which we call the Ate pairing  <span class="math">let \\ N = \\gcd(T^k 1, q^k 1)</span>  and  <span class="math">T^k 1 = LN</span> , with k the embedding degree,</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$e(Q, P)^{L} = f_{T,Q}(P)^{c(q^{k}-1)/N}</span>$
(1)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\begin{array}{c} \\textit{where } c = \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} T^{k-1-i} q^i \\equiv kq^{k-1} \\bmod r \\\\ - \\textit{ for } r \\nmid L, \\textit{ the Ate pairing is non-degenerate} \\end{array}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The proof of Theorem 1 follows immediately from the following three short lemma's.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lemma 1.</strong> Using the notation of Theorem 1, we have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$e(Q, P)^L = f_{T^k, Q}^{(q^k - 1)/N}</span>$
.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">PROOF: By definition of the reduced Tate pairing, we have to compute</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$e(Q, P) = f_{r,Q}(P)^{(q^k - 1)/r} = f_{N,Q}(P)^{(q^k - 1)/N}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">for any N with  <span class="math">r \\mid N \\mid q^k - 1</span> . Note that indeed  <span class="math">r \\mid N</span> : by definition of t we have  <span class="math">\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_q) = q + 1 - t</span> , therefore  <span class="math">q \\equiv t - 1 \\mod r</span>  and thus  <span class="math">(t - 1)^k \\equiv 1 \\mod r</span> . Consider the equalities</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$e(Q, P)^{L} = f_{N,Q}(P)^{L(q^{k}-1)/N} = f_{LN,Q}(P)^{(q^{k}-1)/N}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">=  <span class="math">f_{T^{k}-1,Q}(P)^{(q^{k}-1)/N}</span> ,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where the first follows from the definition of the reduced Tate pairing, the second holds since we can take  <span class="math">f_{LN,Q} = f_{N,Q}^L</span>  and the third equality follows from the definition of L and N. Furthermore, note that  <span class="math">(f_{T^k-1,Q}) = (f_{T^k,Q})</span>  since  <span class="math">Q \\in E[r]</span> , so without loss of generality we can take  <span class="math">f_{T^k-1,Q} = f_{T^k,Q}</span> , which ends the proof.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">An easy calculation [1, Lemma 2] proves the following lemma.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lemma 2.</strong> Using the notation of Theorem 1 we can choose  <span class="math">f_{T^k,Q}</span>  such that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$f_{T^k,Q} = f_{T,Q}^{T^{k-1}} f_{T,TQ}^{T^{k-2}} \\cdots f_{T,T^{k-1}Q}.</span>$
(2)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The crucial point is now that each of the factors in the right hand side of (2) can be expressed in terms of  <span class="math">f_{T,Q}</span> . To see this, note that since  <span class="math">Q \\in \\mathbb{G}_2</span> , we have  <span class="math">\\pi_q(Q) = [q]Q = [t-1]Q = [T]Q</span>  and similarly  <span class="math">\\pi_q^i(Q) = [T^i]Q</span> , so it suffices to relate  <span class="math">f_{T,\\pi_q^i(Q)}</span>  with  <span class="math">f_{T,Q}</span>  as in the following lemma.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lemma 3.</strong> For all  <span class="math">Q \\in \\mathbb{G}_2</span> , we can take  <span class="math">f_{T,\\pi_q^i(Q)} = f_{T,Q}^{\\sigma^i}</span> , with  <span class="math">\\sigma</span>  the q-th power Frobenius automorphism of  <span class="math">\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_q</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">PROOF: By definition we have  <span class="math">(f_{T,\\pi_q^i(Q)}) = T(\\pi_q^i(Q)) - (\\pi_q^{i+1}(Q)) - (T-1)(\\mathcal{O})</span>  and since  <span class="math">\\pi_q</span>  is purely inseparable of degree q we have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(\\pi_q^i)^*(f_{T,\\pi_q^i(Q)}) = q^i T(Q) - q^i (\\pi_q(Q)) - q^i (T-1)(\\mathcal{O})</span>$
<span class="math">$= (f_{T,Q}^{q^i}).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Furthermore,  <span class="math">(\\pi_q^i)^*(f_{T,\\pi_q^i(Q)}) = (f_{T,\\pi_q^i(Q)} \\circ \\pi_q^i)</span> , so we can take</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$f_{T,\\pi_q^i(Q)} \\circ \\pi_q^i = f_{T,Q}^{q^i}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Rewriting  <span class="math">f_{T,Q}^{q^i} = f_{T,Q}^{\\sigma^i} \\circ \\pi_q^i</span>  then shows that we can take  <span class="math">f_{T,\\pi_q^i(Q)} = f_{T,Q}^{\\sigma^i}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that there is also a much easier proof of the above lemma; however the technique in the above proof will be used later, which is why we have given the more complicated version above. For completeness, the easier proof goes as follows: the coefficients of  <span class="math">f_{T,Q}</span>  are polynomial functions of the coefficients of the curve and the coordinates of Q. Since the curve is defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> , the q-th power Frobenius  <span class="math">\\sigma</span>  only acts on the coordinates of Q, so we can indeed take  <span class="math">f_{T,\\pi_q^i(Q)} = f_{T,Q}^{\\sigma^i}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">PROOF OF THEOREM 1: since  <span class="math">P \\in \\mathbb{G}_1</span>  and in particular,  <span class="math">P \\in \\text{Ker}(\\pi_q - 1)</span> , Lemma 3 implies</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$f_{T,\\pi_{\\alpha}^{i}(Q)}(P) = f_{T,Q}^{\\sigma^{i}}(P) = (f_{T,Q}(P))^{q^{i}},</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and using Lemma 2, we obtain</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$f_{T^k,Q}(P) = f_{T,Q}(P)^{\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} T^{k-1-i} q^i}</span>$
.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Substituting the above in Lemma 1, we recover Equation (1)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$e(Q, P)^{L} = f_{T,Q}(P)^{c(q^{k}-1)/N}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">with  <span class="math">c = \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} T^{k-1-i} q^i \\equiv kq^{k-1} \\mod r</span> . This equation shows that  <span class="math">f_{T,Q}(P)</span>  defines a bilinear pairing (since e(Q,P) is bilinear), which is non-degenerate if  <span class="math">r \\nmid L</span> , since e(Q,P) itself is non-degenerate.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For  <span class="math">T^k-1\\neq 0</span> , the Ate pairing will be non-degenerate since then  <span class="math">r\\nmid L</span> . Indeed, since  <span class="math">q\\equiv T \\mod r</span>  and since we assumed that  <span class="math">r^2\\nmid q^k-1</span> , we also have  <span class="math">r^2\\nmid T^k-1</span>  and thus  <span class="math">r\\nmid L</span> , since  <span class="math">r\\mid N</span> . The condition  <span class="math">T^k-1\\neq 0</span>  is easily seen to be equivalent with  <span class="math">t\\neq 2</span>  or  <span class="math">t\\neq 0</span>  for k even. In this case, the Ate pairing  <span class="math">f_{T,Q}(P)</span>  defines a non-degenerate, bilinear pairing on  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2\\times\\mathbb{G}_1\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{G}_T</span> . Similarly, we have the reduced Ate pairing  <span class="math">f_{T,Q}(P)^{(q^k-1)/r}</span> , which by (1) equals a fixed power of the reduced Tate pairing. Indeed, let N=rs then  <span class="math">r\\nmid s</span>  since this would again imply  <span class="math">r^2\\mid T^k-1</span> . Note that  <span class="math">r\\nmid c</span>  since r&gt;k and  <span class="math">r\\nmid q</span> , so we conclude that the reduced Ate pairing equals  <span class="math">e(Q,P)^M</span>  with  <span class="math">M\\equiv Lsc^{-1}</span>  mod r. Also note that the Ate pairing requires a Full-Miller operation, but with a shorter loop than the Miller-lite operation in the Tate pairing.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-5" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.2 The Ate Pairing on <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1 \\times \\mathbb{G}_2</span></h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we study whether the same technique applies to  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1 \\times \\mathbb{G}_2</span> . Denote with  <span class="math">\\hat{\\pi}_q</span>  the dual of the Frobenius endomorphism  <span class="math">\\pi_q</span>  (also called Verschiebung), then since  <span class="math">\\hat{\\pi}_q \\circ \\pi_q = [q]</span> , we conclude that  <span class="math">\\hat{\\pi}_q</span>  acts as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\begin{array}{l} -\\ \\hat{\\pi}_q(P) = [q]P = [t-1]P = [T]P \\text{ for } P \\in \\mathbb{G}_1, \\text{ so } \\mathbb{G}_1 = E[r] \\cap \\operatorname{Ker}(\\hat{\\pi}_q - [q]), \\\\ -\\ \\hat{\\pi}_q(Q) = Q \\text{ for } Q \\in \\mathbb{G}_2, \\text{ so } \\mathbb{G}_2 = E[r] \\cap \\operatorname{Ker}(\\hat{\\pi}_q - [1]). \\end{array}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is clear that Lemma 1 and 2 remain valid when P and Q are swapped. The main problem arises in Lemma 3 when we try to work with Verschiebung instead of Frobenius. We now have to make an explicit distinction between supersingular and ordinary curves, since  <span class="math">\\hat{\\pi}_q</span>  has fundamentally different properties in these cases.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Supersingular Case</strong> In the supersingular case, we have  <span class="math">E[q^i] = \\{\\mathcal{O}\\}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\hat{\\pi}_q^i</span>  is purely inseparable of degree  <span class="math">q^i</span> . The same proof as in Lemma 3 shows that we can take</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$f_{T,\\hat{\\pi}_q^i(P)} \\circ \\hat{\\pi}_q^i = f_{T,P}^{q^i}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since  <span class="math">\\hat{\\pi}_q</span>  acts trivially on  <span class="math">Q \\in \\mathbb{G}_2</span> , we conclude that in fact</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since this is exactly the same as in the previous section, we conclude that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$e(P,Q)^L = f_{T,P}(Q)^{c(q^k-1)/N}</span>$
,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">with  <span class="math">c = \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} T^{k-1-i} q^i \\equiv kq^{k-1} \\mod r</span> . Note that this result corresponds to [1, Theorem 1], but without the need for an automorphism.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Ordinary Case In the ordinary case, we have  <span class="math">E[q^i] \\simeq \\mathbb{Z}/q^i\\mathbb{Z}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\hat{\\pi}_q^i</span>  separable with kernel  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Ker}(\\hat{\\pi}_q^i) = E[q^i]</span> . If we now try to mimic the proof of Lemma 3, we run into the following problem. By definition of the pull back on a divisor and since  <span class="math">\\hat{\\pi}_q</span>  is unramified, we have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(\\hat{\\pi}_q^i)^*(\\hat{\\pi}_q^i P) = \\sum_{R \\in E[q^i]} (P + R),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and thus</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(\\hat{\\pi}_q^i)^*(f_{T,\\hat{\\pi}_q^i(P)}) = T \\sum_{R \\in E[q^i]} (P+R) - \\sum_{R \\in E[q^i]} (TP+R) - (T-1) \\sum_{R \\in E[q^i]} (R).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">By properties of the pull back we also have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">So we have explicitly computed the divisor of  <span class="math">f_{T,\\hat{\\pi}_q(P)} \\circ \\hat{\\pi}_q^i</span>  and as before, would like to relate this to the divisor of  <span class="math">f_{T,P}</span> , but this seems difficult since  <span class="math">\\hat{\\pi}_q</span>  has non-trivial kernel. Furthermore, it is not very surprising that no easy relation exists, since any explicit example shows that in the ordinary case  <span class="math">f_{T,P}(Q)^{(q^k-1)/r}</span>  does not define a bilinear pairing.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The failure of the above technique also suggest a partial solution: as we will show in Section 6, for some elliptic curves, there exists an integer e such that  <span class="math">\\hat{\\pi}_q^e</span>  acts as an automorphism on  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we study the twists of an ordinary elliptic curve E over a finite field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  with  <span class="math">q=p^n</span>  and  <span class="math">p\\geq 5</span> . We will derive their group orders and show how the structure of  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^d})</span>  relates to the various twists of degree d. Much of what follows is well known to the experts but we have been unable to find a location where all these relevant facts and proofs are located. Hence, we present the facts we need and some extensions here.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-7" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">4.1 Existence of Twists</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We begin with the following definition.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 1.</strong> Let E and E' be two elliptic curves over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> , then E' is called a twist of degree d of E if there exists an isomorphism  <span class="math">\\phi_d: E&#x27; \\to E</span>  defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^d}</span>  and d is minimal.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Although not immediate from the above definition, there are only a very limited number of possible degrees d. To see why, let  <span class="math">\\sigma</span>  be the q-th power Frobenius automorphism of  <span class="math">\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_q</span> , then  <span class="math">\\phi_d^{\\sigma} \\circ \\phi_d^{-1} \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(E)</span> , with  <span class="math">\\phi_d^{\\sigma}</span>  the isomorphism obtained by applying  <span class="math">\\sigma</span>  to the coefficients of  <span class="math">\\phi_d</span> . Furthermore, since d was chosen minimal, the order of this automorphism is d. So, if E' is a degree d twist of E, then  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Aut}(E)</span>  must contain an element of order d. However,  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Aut}(E)</span>  always is a finite group of order dividing 24 [20, Theorem III.10.1] and if  <span class="math">p \\geq 5</span> , we have  <span class="math">\\#\\operatorname{Aut}(E) \\mid 6</span> . So for  <span class="math">p \\geq 5</span> , only d = 2, 3, 4, 6 are possible. Furthermore, all twists can be described explicitly as in [20, Proposition X.5.4]</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Proposition 1.</strong> Assume that  <span class="math">p \\geq 5</span> , then the set of twists of E is canonically isomorphic with  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q^*/(\\mathbb{F}_q^*)^d</span>  with d=2 if  <span class="math">j(E)\\neq 0,1728</span> , d=4 if j(E)=1728 and d=6 if j(E)=0.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that in the above cases we have that  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Aut}(E) \\cong \\mu_d</span> , with  <span class="math">\\mu_d</span>  the <em>d</em>-th roots of unity. If we assume that <em>E</em> is given by a short Weierstrass equation  <span class="math">E: y^2 = x^3 + ax + b</span>  with  <span class="math">a, b \\in \\mathbb{F}_q</span> , then an isomorphism is given by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$[\\cdot]: \\mu_d \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(E): \\xi \\mapsto [\\xi] \\quad \\text{with} \\quad [\\xi](x,y) = (\\xi^2 x, \\xi^3 y).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Also it is rather easy to find an equation for the twists given an equation for E. Let  <span class="math">D \\in \\mathbb{F}_q^*</span> , then the twists corresponding to  <span class="math">D \\mod (\\mathbb{F}_q^*)^d</span>  are given by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\begin{array}{ll} d=2 &amp; :y^2=x^3+a/D^2x+b/D^3,\\, \\phi_d:E&#x27;\\to E:(x,y)\\mapsto (Dx,D^{3/2}y)\\\\ d=4 &amp; :y^2=x^3+a/Dx, &amp; \\phi_d:E&#x27;\\to E:(x,y)\\mapsto (D^{1/2}x,D^{3/4}y)\\\\ d=3,\\, 6:y^2=x^3+b/D, &amp; \\phi_d:E&#x27;\\to E:(x,y)\\mapsto (D^{1/3}x,D^{1/2}y) \\end{array}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">An alternative representation of the quadratic twists, which may be more convenient from an implementation perspective, is given by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$d=2: Dy^2=x^3+ax+b, \\phi_d: E&#x27;\\to E: (x,y)\\mapsto (x,D^{1/2}y)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that if we want to construct a twist of degree d, then  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q^*/(\\mathbb{F}_q^*)^d</span>  has to have d elements or equivalently,  <span class="math">q \\equiv 1 \\mod d</span> .</p>

    <h4 id="sec-8" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">4.2 Group Orders of Twists</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Recall that the number of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> -rational points on an elliptic curve E over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  is related to the Frobenius endomorphism  <span class="math">\\pi_q: E \\to E: (x,y) \\mapsto (x^q,y^q)</span> , since  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_q) = \\text{Ker}(\\pi_q - 1)</span> . The following theorem summarises the result.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 2.</strong> Let E be an elliptic curve over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> , then there exists  <span class="math">t \\in \\mathbb{Z}</span> , called the trace of Frobenius, with  <span class="math">|t| \\leq 2\\sqrt{q}</span>  such that  <span class="math">\\pi_q^2 - [t] \\circ \\pi_q + [q] = [0]</span>  in  <span class="math">\\operatorname{End}(E)</span>  and  <span class="math">\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_q) = q+1-t</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let E be an elliptic curve over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  admitting a twist E' of degree d. Then by definition E and E' become isomorphic over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^d}</span> , and in particular  <span class="math">\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^d}) = \\#E&#x27;(\\mathbb{F}_{q^d})</span> . The above theorem shows that  <span class="math">\\alpha = \\xi \\alpha&#x27;</span>  for some  <span class="math">\\xi \\in \\mu_d</span> , so there are only d possibilities for  <span class="math">\\#E&#x27;(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span> .

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>-d=2: since -1 is the only 2-nd primitive root, we get  <span class="math">\\alpha&#x27;=-\\alpha</span>  or t'=-t and the result follows.</li>
      <li>-d=3: note that  <span class="math">\\mu_3 \\subset \\operatorname{End}(E)</span>  and since E is assumed ordinary,  <span class="math">\\operatorname{End}(E)</span>  is an order in the imaginary quadratic field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})</span>  with  <span class="math">\\Delta=t^2-4q</span> . However, the only imaginary quadratic field containing  <span class="math">\\mu_3</span>  is  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})</span>  and thus  <span class="math">t^2-4q=-3\\cdot f^2</span>  for some  <span class="math">f\\in\\mathbb{N}_0</span> . It follows that we can take  <span class="math">\\alpha=(t+f\\sqrt{-3})/2</span> . The two possibilities for  <span class="math">\\alpha&#x27;</span>  then are  <span class="math">\\alpha&#x27;=\\xi_3\\alpha</span>  and  <span class="math">\\alpha&#x27;=\\xi_3^2\\alpha</span>  with  <span class="math">\\xi_3=(-1+\\sqrt{-3})/2</span> . The result follows since  <span class="math">t&#x27;=\\alpha&#x27;+\\bar{\\alpha&#x27;}</span> .</li>
      <li>-d=4: here we have  <span class="math">\\mu_4 \\subset \\operatorname{End}(E)</span>  and since the only imaginary quadratic field containing  <span class="math">\\mu_4</span>  is  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(i)</span> , we can write  <span class="math">t^2-4q=-f^2</span>  with  <span class="math">f\\in\\mathbb{N}_0</span> . Also, we can take  <span class="math">\\alpha=(t+fi)/2</span>  and the only possibilities for  <span class="math">\\alpha&#x27;</span>  are  <span class="math">\\alpha&#x27;=i\\alpha</span>  and  <span class="math">\\alpha&#x27;=-i\\alpha</span> . Again the result follows.</li>
      <li>-d=6: the reasoning is entirely the same as for d=3, but now  <span class="math">\\alpha&#x27;=\\xi_6\\alpha</span>  or  <span class="math">\\alpha&#x27;=\\xi_6^5\\alpha</span>  with  <span class="math">\\xi_6=(1+\\sqrt{-3})/2</span> .</li>

    <h4 id="sec-10" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">4.3 A Structure Theorem</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let E be an elliptic curve over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  admitting a twist E' of degree d. In this section we prove a &quot;folklore&quot; result about  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^d})</span>  being essentially a direct sum of the  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> -rational points on its d twists over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> . Whilst we shall only require a much weaker result, we feel it may be of some independent interest to those working in elliptic curve cryptography.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">\\pi_q</span>  (resp.  <span class="math">\\pi&#x27;_q</span> ) be the Frobenius endomorphism on E (resp. E'). Note that the isomorphism  <span class="math">\\phi_d: E&#x27; \\to E</span>  gives rise to a ring isomorphism</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\Phi_d : \\operatorname{End}(E&#x27;) \\to \\operatorname{End}(E) : f \\mapsto \\Phi_d(f) = \\phi_d \\circ f \\circ \\phi_d^{-1}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since for any rational map  <span class="math">h: E \\to E&#x27;</span>  we clearly have  <span class="math">\\pi&#x27;_q \\circ h = h^{\\sigma} \\circ \\pi_q</span> , we conclude that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\Phi_d(\\pi_q&#x27;) = \\phi_d \\circ \\pi_q&#x27; \\circ \\phi_d^{-1} = \\phi_d \\circ (\\phi_d^{-1})^\\sigma \\circ \\pi_q.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Again since the degree is d, we conclude that  <span class="math">\\phi_d \\circ (\\phi_d^{-1})^{\\sigma} \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(E)</span>  of order precisely d, i.e. is a primitive d-th root of unity. Since we have an isomorphism  <span class="math">[\\cdot]: \\mu_d \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(E)</span> , we can label the twists  <span class="math">E_i</span>  (degree dividing d) of E for  <span class="math">i = 0, \\ldots, d-1</span>  by  <span class="math">\\Phi_i(\\pi_{q,i}) = [\\xi_d^i]\\pi_q</span>  with  <span class="math">\\xi_d</span>  a fixed primitive d-th root of unity,  <span class="math">\\pi_{q,i}</span>  the Frobenius endomorphism on  <span class="math">E_i</span>  and  <span class="math">\\Phi_i</span>  the ring isomorphism induced by the isomorphism  <span class="math">\\phi_i: E_i \\to E</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To see why this is a sensible question, note that the  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^d}</span> -rational points on E are precisely the fixed points of  <span class="math">\\pi_q^d</span> , i.e.  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^d}) = \\operatorname{Ker}(\\pi_q^d - 1)</span> . Similarly, we have  <span class="math">E_i(\\mathbb{F}_q) = \\operatorname{Ker}(\\pi_{q,i} - 1)</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$E_i(\\mathbb{F}_q) \\simeq \\operatorname{Ker}([\\xi_d^i]\\pi_q - 1)</span>$

    <p class="text-gray-300">Furthermore, we can factor  <span class="math">\\pi_q^d - 1 = (-1)^{d-1} \\prod_{i=0}^{d-1} ([\\xi_d^i] \\pi_q - 1)</span> .

By taking degrees, it is easy to see that  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Ker}([\\xi_d^k] - 1) \\subset E[d]</span> , with E[d] the d-torsion points on E.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Furthermore, translating these conditions back to  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span> , we get the following very natural condition: (3) holds if and only if</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^d}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{i=0}^{d-1} E_i(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span>$

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lemma 4.</strong> Let G be a finite abelian group and let  <span class="math">f_i</span>  for i = 0, ..., d-1 be d endomorphisms such that  <span class="math">f_i \\circ f_j = f_j \\circ f_i</span> ,  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Ker}(f_i) \\cap \\operatorname{Ker}(f_j) = 0_G</span>  with  <span class="math">0_G</span>  the neutral element of G and  <span class="math">\\#G = \\prod_{i=0}^{d-1} \\#\\operatorname{Ker}(f_i)</span> , then  <span class="math">G = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^{d-1} \\operatorname{Ker}(f_i)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To see this, first note that  <span class="math">f_j</span>  restricted to  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Ker}(f_i)</span>  is an isomorphism for all  <span class="math">i \\neq j</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">g_i = \\circ_{j\\neq i} f_j</span> , i.e. the composition of all  <span class="math">f_j</span>  without  <span class="math">f_i</span> , then  <span class="math">g_i(e_j) = 0_G</span>  for  <span class="math">i \\neq j</span>  and thus also  <span class="math">g_i(e_i) = 0_G</span> . However, by the above  <span class="math">g_i</span>  is an isomorphism on  <span class="math">\\text{Ker}(f_i)</span>  and thus  <span class="math">e_i = 0_G</span>  which finishes the proof.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In practice however, we only need the following result: since the intersection  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Ker}([\\xi_d^i]\\pi_q - 1) \\cap \\operatorname{Ker}([\\xi_d^j]\\pi_q - 1)</span>  for  <span class="math">i \\neq j</span>  is contained in E[d], we conclude immediately that if l &gt; d is a prime with  <span class="math">l \\mid |\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span>  and  <span class="math">l^2 \\mid |\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^d})</span>  with d minimal, then there exists a <em>unique</em> twist  <span class="math">E_i</span>  of degree d such that  <span class="math">l \\mid |\\#E_i(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span> .</p>

    <h3 id="sec-11" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5 Representing the Group <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span></h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Recall that the group  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span>  was defined as  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2 = E[r] \\cap \\text{Ker}(\\pi_q - q)</span> , i.e. the q-eigenspace of Frobenius on E[r]. Assume that E admits a twist of degree d and</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">let  <span class="math">m = \\gcd(k, d)</span>  and e = k/m. Since k is the minimal value such that r divides  <span class="math">q^k - 1</span> , we know that the group  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^e})</span>  has order divisible by r, but not  <span class="math">r^2</span> . Furthermore, since  <span class="math">r \\geq 7</span> , we know that there is a unique degree m twist E' of E over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^e}</span>  such that  <span class="math">r \\mid \\#E&#x27;(\\mathbb{F}_{q^e})</span> . This unique degree m twist can be easily found using Proposition 2, since there will only be one possible group order divisible by r.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">By the analysis in the previous section, there exists a unique primitive m-th root of unity  <span class="math">\\xi_m</span>  such that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$E&#x27;(\\mathbb{F}_{q^e}) \\simeq \\operatorname{Ker}([\\xi_m]\\pi_q^e - 1).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Ker}([\\xi_m]\\pi_q^e-1)</span>  is stable under  <span class="math">\\pi_q</span> , we conclude  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2=E[r]\\cap\\operatorname{Ker}([\\xi_m]\\pi_q^e-1)</span> . As such, we obtain a much more efficient representation of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span>  as the unique subgroup  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2&#x27;</span>  of  <span class="math">E&#x27;(\\mathbb{F}_{q^e})</span>  of order r. Furthermore, as shown above, there is a monomorphism</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\phi_m: E&#x27;(\\mathbb{F}_{q^e}) \\to E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">so we in fact obtain a modified pairing  <span class="math">\\hat{e}</span>  of an element  <span class="math">P \\in \\mathbb{G}_1</span>  and an element in  <span class="math">Q&#x27; \\in \\mathbb{G}_2&#x27;</span>  via</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\hat{e}(P,Q&#x27;) = e(P,\\phi_m(Q&#x27;)).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">When k is even and d=2 we recover the standard trick of representing  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span>  as the quadratic twist of E over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k/2}}</span> . For k=12, d=6 and  <span class="math">q\\equiv 1\\pmod 6</span>  we recover the representation of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span>  as an elliptic curve of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}</span>  as presented by Barreto and Naehrig [4].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, we achieve similar savings for other values of k which are of practical interest. For example, all curves given by Brezing and Weng [8] have either d=4 or d=6 and so one can use the above technique to significantly improve the performance of arithmetic in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span>  over the standard quadratic twist technique.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is common to implement the finite fields in pairing based systems via socalled pairing friendly fields [19]. These are finite fields defined by a polynomial</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$f(X) = X^k + f_0</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">f_0 \\in \\mathbb{F}_q</span> . These fields offer good arithmetic, in particular they enable fast reduction and also enable faster squaring in the cyclotomic subgroup in which  <span class="math">\\mu_r</span>  is embedded [14]. They also enable the subfields to be implemented relatively efficiently via the polynomial</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$X^{k/i} + f_0</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">for a subfield of index i.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Calculation on the d-th twist can be made simpler by choosing the polynomial f(X) such that in the subfield defined by the polynomial</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$g(X) = X^{k/d} + f_0</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">the value of D which defines the twist is given by the formal root of g(X), i.e. we take the twist defined by  <span class="math">D = (-f_0)^{d/k}</span> . This enables multiplication by D to be performed by a simple coefficient shift in the polynomial basis.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using pairing friendly fields we can naively quantify the improvement. If we write  <span class="math">k=2^i3^j</span>  and use Karatsuba and/or Toom-Cook multiplication/squaring in the extension field, then point addition in  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^k})</span>  requires time proportional to  <span class="math">3^i5^j</span>  multiplications in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If one used the standard quadratic twist representation of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span> , then point addition in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}&#x27;_2</span>  would require time proportional to  <span class="math">3^{i-1}5^j</span> . However, if we use the representation using sextic twists then arithmetic in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span>  would require time proportional to  <span class="math">3^{i-1}5^{j-1}</span> . Hence, a five fold performance improvement in the basic group operations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If one selects q to maximise d then one achieves the performance improvement indicated in Table 1 for various practical values of k, when comparing the degree m twist representation with the standard quadratic twist representation. Note, in this table we assume that optimal curves can be produced, i.e. curves whose parameters balance the security of the DLP in the elliptic curve and the finite field. In practice such curves may not be able to be generated, so the improvement may not be so pronounced in selecting m=4 or 6 over m=2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Further performance improvements can be made in the case of point multiplication in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2&#x27;</span>  via the use of the endomorphism coming from the small CM discriminant, using the techniques of [13]. When performing cofactor multiplication to generate random elements in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span>  the performance improvement is even greater since the cofactor we need to multiply by also shrinks by a factor of around (k-1)/(e-1).</p>

    <h3 id="sec-12" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">6 Twisted Ate Pairing</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Section 3, we studied the relation between e(P,Q) and  <span class="math">f_{T,P}(Q)</span> , by exploiting the definitions of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1 = E[r] \\cap \\operatorname{Ker}(\\pi_q - 1)</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2 = E[r] \\cap \\operatorname{Ker}(\\pi_q - q)</span> . For ordinary curves, we concluded that there was no such relation, basically due to the non-trivial kernel of the dual of Frobenius  <span class="math">\\hat{\\pi}_q</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we will assume that E admits a twist of degree d and again we set  <span class="math">m = \\gcd(k, d)</span>  and e = k/m. In this case, we have the alternative representation of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span>  as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathbb{G}_2 = E[r] \\cap \\operatorname{Ker}([\\xi_m] \\pi_q^e - 1),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">for a unique primitive m-th root of unity  <span class="math">\\xi_m</span> . Since  <span class="math">\\pi_q</span>  acts as multiplication by q on  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span> , we conclude that  <span class="math">[\\xi_m]</span>  acts as multiplication by  <span class="math">q^{-e}</span>  on  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span> . Since  <span class="math">E[r] = \\mathbb{G}_1 \\times \\mathbb{G}_2</span>  and  <span class="math">[\\xi_m]</span>  has degree 1, we conclude that  <span class="math">[\\xi_m]</span>  acts as multiplication by  <span class="math">q^e</span>  on  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As in Section 3, let T=t-1 and recall that  <span class="math">T\\equiv q \\bmod r</span> . Note that for  <span class="math">P\\in\\mathbb{G}_1</span>  we have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$[q^e]P = [T^e]P = [\\xi_m]P</span>$
.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since  <span class="math">[\\xi_m]</span>  is an automorphism of the curve and thus has trivial kernel, we are able to prove the following lemma.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lemma 5.</strong> For all  <span class="math">P \\in \\mathbb{G}_1</span> , we can take  <span class="math">f_{T^e, [\\xi_m]P} \\circ [\\xi_m] = f_{T^e, P}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">PROOF: Since  <span class="math">[\\xi_m]</span>  is an automorphism of the curve and thus separable of degree 1, we have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(f_{T^e,[\\xi_m]P} \\circ [\\xi_m]) = [\\xi_m]^* (f_{T^e,[\\xi_m]P})</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$= [\\xi_m]^* (T^e([\\xi_m]P) - (T^e[\\xi_m]P) - (T-1)(\\mathcal{O}))</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$= T^e(P) - (T^eP) - (T-1)(\\mathcal{O})</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$= (f_{T^eP}).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Which ends the proof.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since  <span class="math">f_{T^e,P}</span>  is defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> , we have  <span class="math">f_{T^e,[\\xi_m]P} \\circ [\\xi_m] \\circ \\pi_q^e = f_{T^e,P}^{q^e}</span>  and thus for  <span class="math">Q \\in \\mathbb{G}_2</span> ,  <span class="math">f_{T^e,T^eP}(Q) = f_{T^e,[\\xi_m]P}(Q) = f_{T^e,P}(Q)^{q^e}</span> . A similar reasoning as in Section 3, then finally shows that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$e(P,Q)^{L} = f_{T^{e},P}(Q)^{c(q^{k}-1)/N},</span>$
(5)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">with  <span class="math">N = \\gcd(T^k - 1, q^k - 1)</span> ,  <span class="math">T^k - 1 = LN</span> ,  <span class="math">c = \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} T^{e(m-1-i)} q^{ei} \\equiv mq^{e(m-1)} \\mod r</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For  <span class="math">T^k-1 \\neq 0</span> , we have  <span class="math">r \\nmid L</span>  and Equation (5) shows that  <span class="math">f_{T^e,P}(Q)</span>  defines a non-degenerate bilinear pairing on  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1 \\times \\mathbb{G}_2</span> , which we call the twisted Ate pairing. Similarly, the reduced twisted Ate pairing is defined by  <span class="math">f_{T^e,P}(Q)^{(q^k-1)/r}</span> . Note that this pairing can only be faster than the Tate pairing when  <span class="math">|T^e| \\leq r</span> , so especially when the trace is small compared to r.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-13" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">7 Efficiency Comparison</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We now turn to quantifying the performance of our different pairing algorithms, for different types of curves and extension degrees. As before we assume E is an ordinary elliptic curve over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  with group order divisible by a large prime r, and we let k denote the embedding degree such that r divides  <span class="math">q^k - 1</span> . We let d denote the size of the set of possible twists of the curve over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> , i.e. d = 6 if E has complex multiplication by an order of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})</span> , d = 4 if it has complex multiplication by an order of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})</span>  and d = 2 otherwise. We set  <span class="math">m = \\gcd(k, d)</span> ,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">which denotes the size of the twist available to us in our system and we let e = k/m which denotes the degree of the field over which the twisted curve will be defined so as to produce the group  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}&#x27;_2</span> . To save space however, we only focus on the cases which produce m = 2 (as in standard implementations) and m = 6 which produces the greatest performance improvement.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We follow the analysis of [19], which was extended in [14]. We have three different pairings we need to compare, and since all involve the same final powering step, we need only focus on the Miller-like part of the algorithm. The final powering step can be computed efficiently using multi-exponentiation techniques and the Frobenius map, a technique introduced for pairings in [15] for k = 6 and applied in [14] to arbitrary k. Our three pairings are given by:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>The standard Tate pairing,  <span class="math">f_{r,P}(Q)</span> .</li>
    </ol></li>
      <li><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>The standard Ate pairing  <span class="math">f_{T,Q}(P)</span> , with T = t 1.</li>

      <li>The twisted Ate pairing  <span class="math">f_{T^e,P}(Q)</span> , with T=t-1.</li>
    </ol></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, we also need to consider the size of t, for most curves this is of size  <span class="math">\\sqrt{q}</span> , however it could possibly be as small as  <span class="math">r^{1/\\varphi(k)}</span> . See [3, 10] for methods to construct curves for pairing based systems with  <span class="math">k \\geq 12</span>  and such a small value of t. Hence, we also quantify the size in this case as well.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We let  <span class="math">M_s, S_s, I_s</span>  denote the cost of multiplication, squaring and inversion in the finite field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^s}</span> . As alluded to earlier, if we are using pairing friendly fields and  <span class="math">s = 2^i 3^j</span>  then we have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$M_s = 3^i 5^j M_1</span>$
and  <span class="math">S_s = 3^i 5^j S_1</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Inversion costs can also be computed via a combination of the rules</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$I_{2s} = 2S_s + 2M_s + I_s</span>$
and  <span class="math">I_{3s} = 3S_s + 11M_s + I_s</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We now turn to estimating the cost of evaluating the functions</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$f_{N,P}(Q)</span>$
and  <span class="math">f_{N,Q}(P)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Following [19] we refer to the former as a Miller-Lite operation and the latter as the Full-Miller operation. We denote the cost of the Miller-Lite algorithm by  <span class="math">C_{\\text{Lite}}</span> . Note, a Full-Miller operation can be performed either using projective coordinates or using affine coordinates, the exact choice as to which is more efficient depending on the ratio  <span class="math">M_1/I_1</span> . We denote the two different costs of the Full-Miller algorithm, by  <span class="math">C_{\\text{Full}}^P</span>  for the projective version and  <span class="math">C_{\\text{Full}}^A</span>  for the affine version. In computing the cost we only count, again following [19] and [14], the cost of the doubling part of Miller's algorithm. This part always needs to be computed irrespective of the signed Hamming weight of the multiplier N, and so can be used as a way of comparing algorithms independent of optimisations on N.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We assume that the elliptic curves are of the form</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$Y^2 = X^3 + AX + B</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where A = −3 if d = 2 and A = 0 when d = 6. A careful analysis of the Miller-operations then reveals the following costs for each operation</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\begin{split} C_{\\text{Lite}} &amp;= \\begin{cases} (4S_1 + (2e+7)M_1 + S_k + M_k) \\log_2 N &amp; \\text{when } A = -3, \\\\ (5S_1 + (2e+6)M_1 + S_k + M_k) \\log_2 N &amp; \\text{when } A = 0. \\end{cases} \\\\ C_{\\text{Full}}^P &amp;= \\begin{cases} (4S_e + 6M_e + 2eM_1 + S_k + M_k) \\log_2 N &amp; \\text{when } A = -3, \\\\ (5S_e + 6M_e + 2eM_1 + S_k + M_k) \\log_2 N &amp; \\text{when } A = 0. \\end{cases} \\\\ C_{\\text{Full}}^A &amp;= (2S_e + 3M_e + I_e + eM_1 + S_k + M_k) \\log_2 N &amp; \\text{any } A. \\end{split}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 2 represents the costs, in terms of multiplications/squarings in Fq, of the different algorithms for various security levels. An average trace t is defined to be t ∼ &lt;sup&gt;√&lt;/sup&gt;q, whereas a small &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt; is defined as &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;∼&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt; 1/ϕ(k) . Ate(P) refers to the Ate pairing implemented with projective coordinates, Ate(A) refers to the Ate pairing implemented with affine coordinates and Ate(T) refers to the twisted Ate pairing implemented with projective coordinates. The security levels are the same as those considered in [19]. In the table we made the assumption that I1/M&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 10. We see that when d = 2 and for general t, the fastest method is almost always the traditional Tate pairing. For other values of d and t we see that the best choice of algorithm depends on the exact choice of k, p and n. However, at the high security levels we find that if one can select a trace which is relatively small one can achieve significant advantages.</p>

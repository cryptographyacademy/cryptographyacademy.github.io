    <p class="text-gray-300">Abstract. In this paper we simplify and extend the Eta pairing, originally discovered in the setting of supersingular curves by Barreto et al., to ordinary curves. Furthermore, we show that by swapping the arguments of the Eta pairing, one obtains a very efficient algorithm resulting in a speed-up of a factor of around six over the usual Tate pairing, in the case of curves which have large security parameters, complex multiplication by an order of <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})</span>, and when the trace of Frobenius is chosen to be suitably small. Other, more minor savings are obtained for more general curves. <span class="math">^{1}</span> <span class="math">^{2}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">1 Introduction</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A bilinear pairing (or simply pairing) is a map of the form</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\hat{t} : \\mathbb{G}_1 \\times \\mathbb{G}_2 \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{G}_T</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1, \\mathbb{G}_2</span> are additive groups and <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_T</span> is a multiplicative group. By bilinear we mean that the map is linear in each component, i.e.</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\begin{array}{l} \\hat{t}(P_1 + P_2, Q) = \\hat{t}(P_1, Q) \\cdot \\hat{t}(P_2, Q), \\\\ \\hat{t}(P, Q_1 + Q_2) = \\hat{t}(P, Q_1) \\cdot \\hat{t}(P, Q_2). \\end{array}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We only consider pairings, between groups of large prime order <span class="math">r</span>, which are non-degenerate, i.e. for which there exists <span class="math">P\\in\\mathbb{G}_{1}</span> and <span class="math">Q\\in\\mathbb{G}_{2}</span> such that <span class="math">\\hat{t}(P,Q)\\neq 1</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Pairings on elliptic curves have, in recent years, become of great research interest in the cryptographic community. This is due to their application in a number of protocols with cryptographic functionality that cannot be achieved using other mathematical primitives, e.g. <em>[6, 7, 16]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Traditionally two types of pairings have been considered, the Weil pairing and the Tate pairing. It is now accepted that for general curves providing common levels of security, the Tate pairing is more efficient, <em>[14, 19]</em>. However, other related pairings are available which in certain situations are more efficient, for example the Eta-pairing <em>[1]</em> on certain supersingular elliptic curves, which in itself extended and optimized the Duursma-Lee techniques introduced in <em>[9]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper we present a new pairing, which is closely related to the Eta-pairing but which can be used efficiently with ordinary elliptic curves. In addition we show that for the types of curves for which our new pairing applies, one achieves further performance improvements due to the fact that one can represent the group <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_{2}</span> more efficiently than one can normally.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We call our new pairing the Ate pairing, pronounced eight. This is for two reasons, firstly it is like the Tate pairing, but faster (hence the missing ‘T’), it is also like the Eta pairing but it reverses the order of the arguments (and Ate is Eta spelled backwards).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Much of the results in this paper are based on the use of properties of twists of elliptic curves. Many of the results we use are well known to the experts, but we have been unable to locate them in the literature. Hence, we will also present these results related to twists.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-1" class="text-2xl font-bold">2 Background on Tate Pairing</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This section briefly recalls the definition of the Tate pairing and sets notation used in the remainder of the paper. An excellent survey of pairings can be found in <em>[11]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span> be a finite field with <span class="math">q=p^{n}</span> elements where <span class="math">p</span> is prime and let <span class="math">E</span> be an elliptic curve defined over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span>. Consider a large prime <span class="math">r</span> such that <span class="math">r\\mid\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{q})</span> and denote the embedding degree by <span class="math">k</span>, i.e. the smallest positive integer such that <span class="math">r</span> divides <span class="math">q^{k}-1</span>. For technical reasons we assume that <span class="math">r^{2}</span> does not divide <span class="math">q^{k}-1</span>, which is not a problem in practice. The embedding degree <span class="math">k</span> is chosen in this way so as to ensure that the full <span class="math">r</span>-torsion <span class="math">E[r]</span> of the elliptic curve is defined over the field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}</span>, i.e. <span class="math">E[r]\\subset E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}})</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">P\\in E[r]</span> and <span class="math">Q\\in E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}})</span>, and consider the divisor <span class="math">D=(Q+R)-(R)</span> with <span class="math">R</span> a random point in <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}})</span>. For every integer <span class="math">s</span>, let <span class="math">f_{s,P}</span> be a function with divisor</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">(f_{s,P})=s(P)-([s]P)-(s-1)\\mathcal{O}\\,,</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">then the Tate pairing is a well-defined, non-degenerate, bilinear pairing</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">\\[ \\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle_{r}:\\left\\{\\begin{array}[]{ccl}E[r]\\times E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}})/rE(\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}})\\rightarrow&\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}^{<em>}/(\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}^{</em>})^{r}\\\\ (P,Q)&\\mapsto\\langle P,Q\\rangle_{r}=f_{r,P}(D).\\end{array}\\right. \\]</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The output of this pairing is only defined up to a coset of <span class="math">(\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}^<em>)^r</span>, however for protocols we will require a unique element of <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}^</em></span>. Hence to obtain a unique representative, one defines the reduced Tate pairing as</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">e(P, Q) = \\langle P, Q \\rangle_{r}^{(q^k - 1)/r} = f_{r, P}(D)^{(q^k - 1)/r} \\in \\mathbb{G}_T.</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is not difficult to show [2] that if <span class="math">k &amp;gt; 1</span> one can in fact ignore working with the divisor <span class="math">D</span> and simply work with the point <span class="math">Q</span>, i.e. one can define the reduced Tate pairing as <span class="math">e(P, Q) = f_{r, P}(Q)^{(q^k - 1)/r}</span>. A second useful property [12] is that <span class="math">r</span> can be replaced by any integer <span class="math">N</span> such that <span class="math">r \\mid N \\mid q^k - 1</span>, i.e. <span class="math">e(P, Q) = f_{N, P}(Q)^{(q^k - 1)/N}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To compute the function <span class="math">f_{s,P}</span> for <span class="math">s &amp;gt; 0</span>, one can simply use Miller's algorithm [17]. For <span class="math">s &amp;lt; 0</span> it suffices to remark that <span class="math">(f_{s,P}) = -(f_{-s,P}) - (v_{sP})</span> with <span class="math">v_{sP}</span> the vertical line through <span class="math">sP</span>, so we can take <span class="math">f_{s,P} = 1 / (f_{-s,P}v_{sP})</span>. If <span class="math">k</span> is even, then <span class="math">v_{sP}</span> can be ignored due to the final powering operation.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-2" class="text-2xl font-bold">3 The Ate Pairing</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we introduce the Ate pairing and show that it extends and simplifies the Eta pairing introduced in [1]. Indeed, the conditions stated in [1, Theorem 1] are in fact automatically satisfied.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Although the Tate pairing as defined in the previous section allows arguments <span class="math">P \\in E[r]</span> and <span class="math">Q \\in E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^k})</span>, in practice one often works with specific subgroups to speed-up the pairing computation. Let <span class="math">\\pi_q</span> be the Frobenius endomorphism, i.e. <span class="math">\\pi_q: E \\to E: (x, y) \\mapsto (x^q, y^q)</span>, then the following choice seems to be optimal:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>the group <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1 = E[r] \\cap \\mathrm{Ker}(\\pi_q - [1])</span>,</li>

      <li>the group <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2 = E[r] \\cap \\mathrm{Ker}(\\pi_q - [q])</span>.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Although in practice one has always used the Tate pairing on <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1 \\times \\mathbb{G}_2</span>, from a theoretical point of view, the Tate pairing on <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2 \\times \\mathbb{G}_1</span> has a much nicer structure.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-3" class="text-2xl font-bold">3.1 The Ate Pairing on <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2 \\times \\mathbb{G}_1</span></h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The main result of this section is summarised in the following theorem.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 1.</strong> Let <span class="math">E</span> be an elliptic curve over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>, <span class="math">r</span> a large prime with <span class="math">r \\mid \\#E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span> and denote the trace of Frobenius with <span class="math">t</span>, i.e. <span class="math">\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_q) = q + 1 - t</span>. For <span class="math">T = t - 1</span>, <span class="math">Q \\in \\mathbb{G}_2 = E[r] \\cap \\mathrm{Ker}(\\pi_q - [q])</span> and <span class="math">P \\in \\mathbb{G}_1 = E[r] \\cap \\mathrm{Ker}(\\pi_q - [1])</span>, we have the following:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li><span class="math">f_{T,Q}(P)</span> defines a bilinear pairing, which we call the Ate pairing</li>

    </ul>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">e(Q, P)^L = f_{T, Q}(P)^{c(q^k - 1)/N} \\tag{1}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">c = \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} T^{k-1-i} q^i \\equiv k q^{k-1} \\bmod r</span></p>

      <li>for <span class="math">r \\nmid L</span>, the Ate pairing is non-degenerate</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The proof of Theorem 1 follows immediately from the following three short lemma’s.</p>

    <h6 id="sec-4" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Lemma 1.</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using the notation of Theorem 1, we have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">e(Q,P)^{L}=f_{T^{k},Q}^{(q^{k}-1)/N}\\,.</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof: By definition of the reduced Tate pairing, we have to compute</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">e(Q,P)=f_{r,Q}(P)^{(q^{k}-1)/r}=f_{N,Q}(P)^{(q^{k}-1)/N}\\,,</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">for any <span class="math">N</span> with <span class="math">r\\mid N\\mid q^{k}-1</span>. Note that indeed <span class="math">r\\mid N</span>: by definition of <span class="math">t</span> we have <span class="math">\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{q})=q+1-t</span>, therefore <span class="math">q\\equiv t-1\\bmod r</span> and thus <span class="math">(t-1)^{k}\\equiv 1\\bmod r</span>. Consider the equalities</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">e(Q,P)^{L}</span> <span class="math">=f_{N,Q}(P)^{L(q^{k}-1)/N}=f_{LN,Q}(P)^{(q^{k}-1)/N}</span> <span class="math">=f_{T^{k}-1,Q}(P)^{(q^{k}-1)/N}\\,,</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where the first follows from the definition of the reduced Tate pairing, the second holds since we can take <span class="math">f_{LN,Q}=f_{N,Q}^{L}</span> and the third equality follows from the definition of <span class="math">L</span> and <span class="math">N</span>. Furthermore, note that <span class="math">(f_{T^{k}-1,Q})=(f_{T^{k},Q})</span> since <span class="math">Q\\in E[r]</span>, so without loss of generality we can take <span class="math">f_{T^{k}-1,Q}=f_{T^{k},Q}</span>, which ends the proof. <span class="math">\\square</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">An easy calculation <em>[1, Lemma 2]</em> proves the following lemma.</p>

    <h6 id="sec-5" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Lemma 2.</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using the notation of Theorem 1 we can choose <span class="math">f_{T^{k},Q}</span> such that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">f_{T^{k},Q}=f_{T,Q}^{T^{k-1}}f_{T,TQ}^{T^{k-2}}\\cdots f_{T,T^{k-1}Q}\\,.</span> (2)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The crucial point is now that each of the factors in the right hand side of (2) can be expressed in terms of <span class="math">f_{T,Q}</span>. To see this, note that since <span class="math">Q\\in\\mathbb{G}_{2}</span>, we have <span class="math">\\pi_{q}(Q)=[q]Q=[t-1]Q=[T]Q</span> and similarly <span class="math">\\pi_{q}^{i}(Q)=[T^{i}]Q</span>, so it suffices to relate <span class="math">f_{T,\\pi_{q}^{i}(Q)}</span> with <span class="math">f_{T,Q}</span> as in the following lemma.</p>

    <h6 id="sec-6" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Lemma 3.</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For all <span class="math">Q\\in\\mathbb{G}_{2}</span>, we can take <span class="math">f_{T,\\pi_{q}^{i}(Q)}=f_{T,Q}^{\\sigma^{i}}</span>, with <span class="math">\\sigma</span> the <span class="math">q</span>-th power Frobenius automorphism of <span class="math">\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_{q}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof: By definition we have <span class="math">(f_{T,\\pi_{q}^{i}(Q)})=T(\\pi_{q}^{i}(Q))-(\\pi_{q}^{i+1}(Q))-(T-1)(\\mathcal{O})</span> and since <span class="math">\\pi_{q}</span> is purely inseparable of degree <span class="math">q</span> we have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">(\\pi_{q}^{i})^{*}(f_{T,\\pi_{q}^{i}(Q)})</span> <span class="math">=q^{i}T(Q)-q^{i}(\\pi_{q}(Q))-q^{i}(T-1)(\\mathcal{O})</span> <span class="math">=(f_{T,Q}^{q^{i}})\\,.</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Furthermore, <span class="math">(\\pi_{q}^{i})^{*}(f_{T,\\pi_{q}^{i}(Q)})=(f_{T,\\pi_{q}^{i}(Q)}\\circ\\pi_{q}^{i})</span>, so we can take</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">f_{T,\\pi_{q}^{i}(Q)}\\circ\\pi_{q}^{i}=f_{T,Q}^{q^{i}}\\,.</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Rewriting <span class="math">f_{T,Q}^{q^{i}}=f_{T,Q}^{\\sigma^{i}}\\circ\\pi_{q}^{i}</span> then shows that we can take <span class="math">f_{T,\\pi_{q}^{i}(Q)}=f_{T,Q}^{\\sigma^{i}}</span>. <span class="math">\\square</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">##</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that there is also a much easier proof of the above lemma; however the technique in the above proof will be used later, which is why we have given the more complicated version above. For completeness, the easier proof goes as follows: the coefficients of <span class="math">f_{T,Q}</span> are polynomial functions of the coefficients of the curve and the coordinates of <span class="math">Q</span>. Since the curve is defined over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span>, the <span class="math">q</span>-th power Frobenius <span class="math">\\sigma</span> only acts on the coordinates of <span class="math">Q</span>, so we can indeed take <span class="math">f_{T,\\pi_{q}^{i}(Q)}=f_{T,Q}^{\\sigma^{i}}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof of Theorem 1: since <span class="math">P\\in\\mathbb{G}_{1}</span> and in particular, <span class="math">P\\in\\mathrm{Ker}(\\pi_{q}-1)</span>, Lemma 3 implies</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">f_{T,\\pi_{q}^{i}(Q)}(P)=f_{T,Q}^{\\sigma^{i}}(P)=(f_{T,Q}(P))^{q^{i}}\\,,</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and using Lemma 2, we obtain</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">f_{T^{k},Q}(P)=f_{T,Q}(P)^{\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}T^{k-1-i}q^{i}}\\,.</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Substituting the above in Lemma 1, we recover Equation (1)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">e(Q,P)^{L}=f_{T,Q}(P)^{c(q^{k}-1)/N}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">with <span class="math">c=\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}T^{k-1-i}q^{i}\\equiv kq^{k-1}\\bmod r</span>. This equation shows that <span class="math">f_{T,Q}(P)</span> defines a bilinear pairing (since <span class="math">e(Q,P)</span> is bilinear), which is non-degenerate if <span class="math">r\\nmid L</span>, since <span class="math">e(Q,P)</span> itself is non-degenerate. <span class="math">\\square</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For <span class="math">T^{k}-1\\neq 0</span>, the Ate pairing will be non-degenerate since then <span class="math">r\\nmid L</span>. Indeed, since <span class="math">q\\equiv T\\bmod r</span> and since we assumed that <span class="math">r^{2}\\nmid q^{k}-1</span>, we also have <span class="math">r^{2}\\nmid T^{k}-1</span> and thus <span class="math">r\\nmid L</span>, since <span class="math">r\\mid N</span>. The condition <span class="math">T^{k}-1\\neq 0</span> is easily seen to be equivalent with <span class="math">t\\neq 2</span> or <span class="math">t\\neq 0</span> for <span class="math">k</span> even. In this case, the Ate pairing <span class="math">f_{T,Q}(P)</span> defines a non-degenerate, bilinear pairing on <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_{2}\\times\\mathbb{G}_{1}\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{G}_{T}</span>. Similarly, we have the reduced Ate pairing <span class="math">f_{T,Q}(P)^{(q^{k}-1)/r}</span>, which by (1) equals a fixed power of the reduced Tate pairing. Indeed, let <span class="math">N=rs</span> then <span class="math">r\\nmid s</span> since this would again imply <span class="math">r^{2}\\mid T^{k}-1</span>. Note that <span class="math">r\\nmid c</span> since <span class="math">r&gt;k</span> and <span class="math">r\\nmid q</span>, so we conclude that the reduced Ate pairing equals <span class="math">e(Q,P)^{M}</span> with <span class="math">M\\equiv Lsc^{-1}\\bmod r</span>. Also note that the Ate pairing requires a Full-Miller operation, but with a shorter loop than the Miller-lite operation in the Tate pairing.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since this is exactly the same as in the previous section, we conclude that</p>

    <h4 id="sec-9" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Ordinary Case</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the ordinary case, we have <span class="math">E[q^{i}]\\simeq\\mathbb{Z}/q^{i}\\mathbb{Z}</span> and <span class="math">\\hat{\\pi}^{i}_{q}</span> separable with kernel <span class="math">\\mathrm{Ker}(\\hat{\\pi}^{i}_{q})=E[q^{i}]</span>. If we now try to mimic the proof of Lemma 3, we run into the following problem. By definition of the pull back on a divisor and since <span class="math">\\hat{\\pi}_{q}</span> is unramified, we have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">(\\hat{\\pi}^{i}_{q})^{*}(\\hat{\\pi}^{i}_{q}P)=\\sum_{R\\in E[q^{i}]}(P+R)\\,,</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and thus</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">(\\hat{\\pi}^{i}_{q})^{*}(f_{T,\\hat{\\pi}^{i}_{q}(P)})=T\\sum_{R\\in E[q^{i}]}(P+R)-\\sum_{R\\in E[q^{i}]}(TP+R)</span> <span class="math">-(T-1)\\sum_{R\\in E[q^{i}]}(R)\\,.</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">By properties of the pull back we also have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">(\\hat{\\pi}^{i}_{q})^{*}(f_{T,\\hat{\\pi}_{q}(P)})=(f_{T,\\hat{\\pi}_{q}(P)}\\circ\\hat{\\pi}^{i}_{q})\\,.</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">So we have explicitly computed the divisor of <span class="math">f_{T,\\hat{\\pi}_{q}(P)}\\circ\\hat{\\pi}^{i}_{q}</span> and as before, would like to relate this to the divisor of <span class="math">f_{T,P}</span>, but this seems difficult since <span class="math">\\hat{\\pi}_{q}</span> has non-trivial kernel. Furthermore, it is not very surprising that no easy relation exists, since any explicit example shows that in the ordinary case <span class="math">f_{T,P}(Q)^{(q^{k}-1)/r}</span> does not define a bilinear pairing.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The failure of the above technique also suggest a partial solution: as we will show in Section 6, for some elliptic curves, there exists an integer <span class="math">e</span> such that <span class="math">\\hat{\\pi}^{e}_{q}</span> acts as an automorphism on <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_{1}</span>. In this case, we will be able to relate <span class="math">e(P,Q)</span> to <span class="math">f_{T^{e},P}(Q)</span> using the theory of twists.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we study the twists of an ordinary elliptic curve <span class="math">E</span> over a finite field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span> with <span class="math">q=p^{n}</span> and <span class="math">p\\geq 5</span>.

Much of what follows is well known to the experts but we have been unable to find a location where all these relevant facts and proofs are located. Hence, we present the facts we need and some extensions here.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-11" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.1 Existence of Twists</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We begin with the following definition.</p>

    <h6 id="sec-12" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Definition 1.</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">E</span> and <span class="math">E^{\\prime}</span> be two elliptic curves over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span>, then <span class="math">E^{\\prime}</span> is called a twist of degree <span class="math">d</span> of <span class="math">E</span> if there exists an isomorphism <span class="math">\\phi_{d}:E^{\\prime}\\to E</span> defined over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{d}}</span> and <span class="math">d</span> is minimal.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Although not immediate from the above definition, there are only a very limited number of possible degrees <span class="math">d</span>. To see why, let <span class="math">\\sigma</span> be the <span class="math">q</span>-th power Frobenius automorphism of <span class="math">\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_{q}</span>, then <span class="math">\\phi_{d}^{\\sigma}\\circ\\phi_{d}^{-1}\\in\\mathrm{Aut}(E)</span>, with <span class="math">\\phi_{d}^{\\sigma}</span> the isomorphism obtained by applying <span class="math">\\sigma</span> to the coefficients of <span class="math">\\phi_{d}</span>. Furthermore, since <span class="math">d</span> was chosen minimal, the order of this automorphism is <span class="math">d</span>. So, if <span class="math">E^{\\prime}</span> is a degree <span class="math">d</span> twist of <span class="math">E</span>, then <span class="math">\\mathrm{Aut}(E)</span> must contain an element of order <span class="math">d</span>. However, <span class="math">\\mathrm{Aut}(E)</span> always is a finite group of order dividing <span class="math">24</span> <em>[20, Theorem III.10.1]</em> and if <span class="math">p\\geq 5</span>, we have <span class="math">\\#\\mathrm{Aut}(E)\\mid 6</span>. So for <span class="math">p\\geq 5</span>, only <span class="math">d=2,3,4,6</span> are possible. Furthermore, all twists can be described explicitly as in <em>[20, Proposition X.5.4]</em></p>

    <h6 id="sec-13" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Proposition 1.</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Assume that <span class="math">p\\geq 5</span>, then the set of twists of <span class="math">E</span> is canonically isomorphic with <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{<em>}/(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{</em>})^{d}</span> with <span class="math">d=2</span> if <span class="math">j(E)\\neq 0,1728</span>, <span class="math">d=4</span> if <span class="math">j(E)=1728</span> and <span class="math">d=6</span> if <span class="math">j(E)=0</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that in the above cases we have that <span class="math">\\mathrm{Aut}(E)\\cong\\mu_{d}</span>, with <span class="math">\\mu_{d}</span> the <span class="math">d</span>-th roots of unity. If we assume that <span class="math">E</span> is given by a short Weierstrass equation <span class="math">E:y^{2}=x^{3}+ax+b</span> with <span class="math">a,b\\in\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span>, then an isomorphism is given by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Also it is rather easy to find an equation for the twists given an equation for <span class="math">E</span>. Let <span class="math">D\\in\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{<em>}</span>, then the twists corresponding to <span class="math">D\\bmod{(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{</em>})^{d}}</span> are given by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">d=2\\quad</span> <span class="math">:y^{2}=x^{3}+a/D^{2}x+b/D^{3},\\,\\phi_{d}:E^{\\prime}\\to E:(x,y)\\mapsto(Dx,D^{3/2}y)</span> <span class="math">d=4\\quad</span> <span class="math">:y^{2}=x^{3}+a/Dx,\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\phi_{d}:E^{\\prime}\\to E:(x,y)\\mapsto(D^{1/2}x,D^{3/4}y)</span> <span class="math">d=3,\\,6:y^{2}=x^{3}+b/D,\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\phi_{d}:E^{\\prime}\\to E:(x,y)\\mapsto(D^{1/3}x,D^{1/2}y)</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">An alternative representation of the quadratic twists, which may be more convenient from an implementation perspective, is given by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">d=2:Dy^{2}=x^{3}+ax+b,\\,\\phi_{d}:E^{\\prime}\\to E:(x,y)\\mapsto(x,D^{1/2}y)</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that if we want to construct a twist of degree <span class="math">d</span>, then <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{<em>}/(\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{</em>})^{d}</span> has to have <span class="math">d</span> elements or equivalently, <span class="math">q\\equiv 1\\bmod d</span>.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li><span class="math">d = 2</span>: since <span class="math">-1</span> is the only 2-nd primitive root, we get <span class="math">\\alpha&#x27; = -\\alpha</span> or <span class="math">t&#x27; = -t</span> and the result follows.</li>

      <li><span class="math">d = 3</span>: note that <span class="math">\\mu_3 \\subset \\operatorname{End}(E)</span> and since <span class="math">E</span> is assumed ordinary, <span class="math">\\operatorname{End}(E)</span> is an order in the imaginary quadratic field <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})</span> with <span class="math">\\Delta = t^2 - 4q</span>. However, the only imaginary quadratic field containing <span class="math">\\mu_3</span> is <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})</span> and thus <span class="math">t^2 - 4q = -3 \\cdot f^2</span> for some <span class="math">f \\in \\mathbb{N}_0</span>. It follows that we can take <span class="math">\\alpha = (t + f\\sqrt{-3})/2</span>. The two possibilities for <span class="math">\\alpha&#x27;</span> then are <span class="math">\\alpha&#x27; = \\xi_3\\alpha</span> and <span class="math">\\alpha&#x27; = \\xi_3^2\\alpha</span> with <span class="math">\\xi_3 = (-1 + \\sqrt{-3})/2</span>.

      <li><span class="math">d = 4</span>: here we have <span class="math">\\mu_4 \\subset \\operatorname{End}(E)</span> and since the only imaginary quadratic field containing <span class="math">\\mu_4</span> is <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(i)</span>, we can write <span class="math">t^2 - 4q = -f^2</span> with <span class="math">f \\in \\mathbb{N}_0</span>.

Whilst we shall only require a much weaker result, we feel it may be of some independent interest to those working in elliptic curve cryptography.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">\\pi_{q}</span> (resp. <span class="math">\\pi^{\\prime}_{q}</span>) be the Frobenius endomorphism on <span class="math">E</span> (resp. <span class="math">E^{\\prime}</span>). Note that the isomorphism <span class="math">\\phi_{d}:E^{\\prime}\\to E</span> gives rise to a ring isomorphism</p>

Similarly, we have <span class="math">E_{i}(\\mathbb{F}_{q})=\\mathrm{Ker}(\\pi_{q,i}-1)</span>.

Let  <span class="math">E</span>  be an ordinary elliptic curve over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  admitting a twist of degree  <span class="math">d</span>  and let  <span class="math">E_i</span>  for  <span class="math">i = 0, \\ldots, d - 1</span>  be the twists of  <span class="math">E</span>  of degree dividing  <span class="math">d</span> . Assume that  <span class="math">\\# E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span>  satisfies condition (4), then</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">E \\left(\\mathbb {F} _ {q ^ {d}}\\right) \\cong \\bigoplus_ {i = 0} ^ {d - 1} E _ {i} \\left(\\mathbb {F} _ {q}\\right).</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof: Let  <span class="math">f_{i} = [\\xi_{d}^{i}]\\pi_{q} - 1</span>  for  <span class="math">i = 0,\\dots ,d - 1</span> , then as shown above we have  <span class="math">\\mathrm{Ker}(f_i)\\cap \\mathrm{Ker}(f_j) = \\mathcal{O}</span>  for  <span class="math">i\\neq j</span>  and  <span class="math">\\# E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^d}) = \\prod_{i = 0}^{d - 1}\\# \\mathrm{Ker}(f_i)</span> . Furthermore, since the curve is ordinary, we have  <span class="math">f_{i}\\circ f_{j} = f_{j}\\circ f_{i}</span>  for all  <span class="math">i,j</span> . Now apply Lemma 4, which finalises the proof.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Lemma 4. Let  <span class="math">G</span>  be a finite abelian group and let  <span class="math">f_{i}</span>  for  <span class="math">i = 0, \\ldots, d - 1</span>  be  <span class="math">d</span>  endomorphisms such that  <span class="math">f_{i} \\circ f_{j} = f_{j} \\circ f_{i}</span> ,  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Ker}(f_{i}) \\cap \\operatorname{Ker}(f_{j}) = 0_{G}</span>  with  <span class="math">0_{G}</span>  the neutral element of  <span class="math">G</span>  and  <span class="math">\\# G = \\prod_{i=0}^{d-1} \\# \\operatorname{Ker}(f_{i})</span> , then  <span class="math">G = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^{d-1} \\operatorname{Ker}(f_{i})</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof: Since by assumption the kernels have intersection  <span class="math">\\{0_G\\}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\# G = \\prod_{i=0}^{d-1} \\# \\operatorname{Ker}(f_i)</span> , it suffices to prove that each element  <span class="math">g \\in G</span>  can be written uniquely as  <span class="math">g = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} e_i</span>  with  <span class="math">e_i \\in \\operatorname{Ker}(f_i)</span> . Equivalently, if  <span class="math">0_G = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} e_i</span>  with  <span class="math">e_i \\in \\operatorname{Ker}(f_i)</span> , then  <span class="math">e_i = 0_G</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To see this, first note that  <span class="math">f_{j}</span>  restricted to  <span class="math">\\mathrm{Ker}(f_i)</span>  is an isomorphism for all  <span class="math">i \\neq j</span> . Indeed,  <span class="math">f_{j} \\circ f_{i} = f_{i} \\circ f_{j}</span>  implies that  <span class="math">f_{j}(\\mathrm{Ker}(f_{i})) \\subset \\mathrm{Ker}(f_{i})</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathrm{Ker}(f_{i}) \\cap \\mathrm{Ker}(f_{j}) = 0_{G}</span>  implies that  <span class="math">f_{j}</span>  is injective on  <span class="math">\\mathrm{Ker}(f_{i})</span>  and thus also surjective.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">g_{i} = \\circ_{j \\neq i} f_{j}</span> , i.e. the composition of all  <span class="math">f_{j}</span>  without  <span class="math">f_{i}</span> , then  <span class="math">g_{i}(e_{j}) = 0_{G}</span>  for  <span class="math">i \\neq j</span>  and thus also  <span class="math">g_{i}(e_{i}) = 0_{G}</span> . However, by the above  <span class="math">g_{i}</span>  is an isomorphism on  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Ker}(f_{i})</span>  and thus  <span class="math">e_{i} = 0_{G}</span>  which finishes the proof.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In practice however, we only need the following result: since the intersection  <span class="math">\\mathrm{Ker}([\\xi_d^i ]\\pi_q - 1)\\cap \\mathrm{Ker}([\\xi_d^j ]\\pi_q - 1)</span>  for  <span class="math">i\\neq j</span>  is contained in  <span class="math">E[d]</span> , we conclude immediately that if  <span class="math">l &amp;gt; d</span>  is a prime with  <span class="math">l\\parallel \\# E(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span>  and  <span class="math">l^2\\parallel \\# E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^d})</span>  with  <span class="math">d</span>  minimal, then there exists a unique twist  <span class="math">E_{i}</span>  of degree  <span class="math">d</span>  such that  <span class="math">l\\parallel \\# E_i(\\mathbb{F}_q)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Recall that the group  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span>  was defined as  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2 = E[r] \\cap \\mathrm{Ker}(\\pi_q - q)</span> , i.e. the  <span class="math">q</span> -eigenspace of Frobenius on  <span class="math">E[r]</span> . Assume that  <span class="math">E</span>  admits a twist of degree  <span class="math">d</span>  and</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">let <span class="math">m=\\gcd(k,d)</span> and <span class="math">e=k/m</span>. Since <span class="math">k</span> is the minimal value such that <span class="math">r</span> divides <span class="math">q^{k}-1</span>, we know that the group <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^{e}})</span> has order divisible by <span class="math">r</span>, but not <span class="math">r^{2}</span>. Furthermore, since <span class="math">r\\geq 7</span>, we know that there is a unique degree <span class="math">m</span> twist <span class="math">E^{\\prime}</span> of <span class="math">E</span> over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{e}}</span> such that <span class="math">r\\mid\\#E^{\\prime}(\\mathbb{F}_{q^{e}})</span>. This unique degree <span class="math">m</span> twist can be easily found using Proposition 2, since there will only be one possible group order divisible by <span class="math">r</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">By the analysis in the previous section, there exists a unique primitive <span class="math">m</span>-th root of unity <span class="math">\\xi_{m}</span> such that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">E^{\\prime}(\\mathbb{F}_{q^{e}})\\simeq\\text{Ker}([\\xi_{m}]\\pi_{q}^{e}-1)\\,.</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since <span class="math">\\text{Ker}([\\xi_{m}]\\pi_{q}^{e}-1)</span> is stable under <span class="math">\\pi_{q}</span>, we conclude <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_{2}=E[r]\\cap\\text{Ker}([\\xi_{m}]\\pi_{q}^{e}-1)</span>. As such, we obtain a much more efficient representation of <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_{2}</span> as the unique subgroup <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_{2}^{\\prime}</span> of <span class="math">E^{\\prime}(\\mathbb{F}_{q^{e}})</span> of order <span class="math">r</span>. Furthermore, as shown above, there is a monomorphism</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\phi_{m}:E^{\\prime}(\\mathbb{F}_{q^{e}})\\to E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}})\\,,</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">so we in fact obtain a modified pairing <span class="math">\\hat{e}</span> of an element <span class="math">P\\in\\mathbb{G}_{1}</span> and an element in <span class="math">Q^{\\prime}\\in\\mathbb{G}_{2}^{\\prime}</span> via</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\hat{e}(P,Q^{\\prime})=e(P,\\phi_{m}(Q^{\\prime}))\\,.</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">When <span class="math">k</span> is even and <span class="math">d=2</span> we recover the standard trick of representing <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_{2}</span> as the quadratic twist of <span class="math">E</span> over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k/2}}</span>. For <span class="math">k=12,d=6</span> and <span class="math">q\\equiv 1\\pmod{6}</span> we recover the representation of <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_{2}</span> as an elliptic curve of <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2}}</span> as presented by Barreto and Naehrig <em>[4]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, we achieve similar savings for other values of <span class="math">k</span> which are of practical interest. For example, all curves given by Brezing and Weng <em>[8]</em> have either <span class="math">d=4</span> or <span class="math">d=6</span> and so one can use the above technique to significantly improve the performance of arithmetic in <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_{2}</span> over the standard quadratic twist technique.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is common to implement the finite fields in pairing based systems via so-called pairing friendly fields <em>[19]</em>. These are finite fields defined by a polynomial</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">f(X)=X^{k}+f_{0}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">f_{0}\\in\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span>. These fields offer good arithmetic, in particular they enable fast reduction and also enable faster squaring in the cyclotomic subgroup in which <span class="math">\\mu_{r}</span> is embedded <em>[14]</em>. They also enable the subfields to be implemented relatively efficiently via the polynomial</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">X^{k/i}+f_{0}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">for a subfield of index <span class="math">i</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Calculation on the <span class="math">d</span>-th twist can be made simpler by choosing the polynomial <span class="math">f(X)</span> such that in the subfield defined by the polynomial</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">g(X)=X^{k/d}+f_{0}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">the value of <span class="math">D</span> which defines the twist is given by the formal root of <span class="math">g(X)</span>, i.e. we take the twist defined by <span class="math">D=(-f_{0})^{d/k}</span>. This enables multiplication by <span class="math">D</span> to be performed by a simple coefficient shift in the polynomial basis.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using pairing friendly fields we can naively quantify the improvement. If we write  <span class="math">k = 2^{i}3^{j}</span>  and use Karatsuba and/or Toom-Cook multiplication/squaring in the extension field, then point addition in  <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_{q^k})</span>  requires time proportional to  <span class="math">3^{i}5^{j}</span>  multiplications in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If one used the standard quadratic twist representation of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span> , then point addition in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2&#x27;</span>  would require time proportional to  <span class="math">3^{i-1}5^j</span> . However, if we use the representation using sextic twists then arithmetic in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span>  would require time proportional to  <span class="math">3^{i-1}5^{j-1}</span> . Hence, a five fold performance improvement in the basic group operations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If one selects  <span class="math">q</span>  to maximise  <span class="math">d</span>  then one achieves the performance improvement indicated in Table 1 for various practical values of  <span class="math">k</span> , when comparing the degree  <span class="math">m</span>  twist representation with the standard quadratic twist representation. Note, in this table we assume that optimal curves can be produced, i.e. curves whose parameters balance the security of the DLP in the elliptic curve and the finite field. In practice such curves may not be able to be generated, so the improvement may not be so pronounced in selecting  <span class="math">m = 4</span>  or 6 over  <span class="math">m = 2</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Further performance improvements can be made in the case of point multiplication in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2^{\\prime}</span>  via the use of the endomorphism coming from the small CM discriminant, using the techniques of [13]. When performing cofactor multiplication to generate random elements in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span>  the performance improvement is even greater since the cofactor we need to multiply by also shrinks by a factor of around  <span class="math">(k - 1) / (e - 1)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We now turn to quantifying the performance of our different pairing algorithms, for different types of curves and extension degrees. As before we assume <span class="math">E</span> is an ordinary elliptic curve over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span> with group order divisible by a large prime <span class="math">r</span>, and we let <span class="math">k</span> denote the embedding degree such that <span class="math">r</span> divides <span class="math">q^{k}-1</span>. We let <span class="math">d</span> denote the size of the set of possible twists of the curve over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span>, i.e. <span class="math">d=6</span> if <span class="math">E</span> has complex multiplication by an order of <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})</span>, <span class="math">d=4</span> if it has complex multiplication by an order of <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})</span> and <span class="math">d=2</span> otherwise.

    <p class="text-gray-300">which denotes the size of the twist available to us in our system and we let <span class="math">e=k/m</span> which denotes the degree of the field over which the twisted curve will be defined so as to produce the group <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_{2}^{\\prime}</span>. To save space however, we only focus on the cases which produce <span class="math">m=2</span> (as in standard implementations) and <span class="math">m=6</span> which produces the greatest performance improvement.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We follow the analysis of <em>[19]</em>, which was extended in <em>[14]</em>. We have three different pairings we need to compare, and since all involve the same final powering step, we need only focus on the Miller-like part of the algorithm. The final powering step can be computed efficiently using multi-exponentiation techniques and the Frobenius map, a technique introduced for pairings in <em>[15]</em> for <span class="math">k=6</span> and applied in <em>[14]</em> to arbitrary <span class="math">k</span>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, we also need to consider the size of <span class="math">t</span>, for most curves this is of size <span class="math">\\sqrt{q}</span>, however it could possibly be as small as <span class="math">r^{1/\\varphi(k)}</span>. See <em>[3, 10]</em> for methods to construct curves for pairing based systems with <span class="math">k\\geq 12</span> and such a small value of <span class="math">t</span>. Hence, we also quantify the size in this case as well.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We let <span class="math">M_{s},S_{s},I_{s}</span> denote the cost of multiplication, squaring and inversion in the finite field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{s}}</span>. As alluded to earlier, if we are using pairing friendly fields and <span class="math">s=2^{i}3^{j}</span> then we have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">M_{s}=3^{i}5^{j}M_{1}\\text{ and }S_{s}=3^{i}5^{j}S_{1}.</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Inversion costs can also be computed via a combination of the rules</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">I_{2s}=2S_{s}+2M_{s}+I_{s}\\text{ and }I_{3s}=3S_{s}+11M_{s}+I_{s}.</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We now turn to estimating the cost of evaluating the functions</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">f_{N,P}(Q)\\text{ and }f_{N,Q}(P).</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Following <em>[19]</em> we refer to the former as a Miller-Lite operation and the latter as the Full-Miller operation. We denote the cost of the Miller-Lite algorithm by <span class="math">C_{\\text{Lite}}</span>. Note, a Full-Miller operation can be performed either using projective coordinates or using affine coordinates, the exact choice as to which is more efficient depending on the ratio <span class="math">M_{1}/I_{1}</span>. We denote the two different costs of the Full-Miller algorithm, by <span class="math">C_{\\text{Full}}^{P}</span> for the projective version and <span class="math">C_{\\text{Full}}^{A}</span> for the affine version. In computing the cost we only count, again following <em>[19]</em> and <em>[14]</em>, the cost of the doubling part of Miller’s algorithm. This part always needs to be computed irrespective of the signed Hamming weight of the multiplier <span class="math">N</span>, and so can be used as a way of comparing algorithms independent of optimisations on <span class="math">N</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We assume that the elliptic curves are of the form</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">Y^{2}=X^{3}+AX+B</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">A=-3</span> if <span class="math">d=2</span> and <span class="math">A=0</span> when <span class="math">d=6</span>. A careful analysis of the Miller-operations then reveals the following costs for each operation</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">C_{\\text{Lite}}</span> \\[ =\\left\\{\\begin{array}[]{l}(4S_{1}+(2e+7)M_{1}+S_{k}+M_{k})\\log_{2}N\\ \\ \\ \\text{when}\\ A=-3,\\\\ (5S_{1}+(2e+6)M_{1}+S_{k}+M_{k})\\log_{2}N\\ \\ \\ \\text{when}\\ A=0.\\end{array}\\right. \\] <span class="math">C_{\\text{Full}}^{P}</span> \\[ =\\left\\{\\begin{array}[]{l}(4S_{e}+6M_{e}+2eM_{1}+S_{k}+M_{k})\\log_{2}N\\ \\text{when}\\ A=-3,\\\\ (5S_{e}+6M_{e}+2eM_{1}+S_{k}+M_{k})\\log_{2}N\\ \\text{when}\\ A=0.\\end{array}\\right. \\] <span class="math">C_{\\text{Full}}^{A}</span> <span class="math">=(2S_{e}+3M_{e}+I_{e}+eM_{1}+S_{k}+M_{k})\\log_{2}N\\ \\ \\text{any}\\ A.</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 2 represents the costs, in terms of multiplications/squarings in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span>, of the different algorithms for various security levels. An average trace <span class="math">t</span> is defined to be <span class="math">t\\sim\\sqrt{q}</span>, whereas a small <span class="math">t</span> is defined as <span class="math">t\\sim r^{1/\\varphi(k)}</span>. Ate(P) refers to the Ate pairing implemented with projective coordinates, Ate(A) refers to the Ate pairing implemented with affine coordinates and Ate(T) refers to the twisted Ate pairing implemented with projective coordinates. The security levels are the same as those considered in <em>[19]</em>. In the table we made the assumption that <span class="math">I_{1}/M_{1}\\approx 10</span>. We see that when <span class="math">d=2</span> and for general <span class="math">t</span>, the fastest method is almost always the traditional Tate pairing. For other values of <span class="math">d</span> and <span class="math">t</span> we see that the best choice of algorithm depends on the exact choice of <span class="math">k</span>, <span class="math">p</span> and <span class="math">n</span>. However, at the high security levels we find that if one can select a trace which is relatively small one can achieve significant advantages.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">Linear cryptanalysis, along with differential cryptanalysis, is an important tool to evaluate the security of block ciphers. This work introduces a novel extension of linear cryptanalysis: zero-correlation linear cryptanalysis, a technique applicable to many block cipher constructions. It is based on linear approximations with a correlation value of exactly zero. For a permutation on $n$ bits, an algorithm of complexity $2^{n-1}$ is proposed for the exact evaluation of correlation. Non-trivial zero-correlation linear approximations  are demonstrated for various block cipher structures including AES, balanced Feistel networks, Skipjack, CLEFIA, and CAST256. As an example, using the zero-correlation linear cryptanalysis, a key-recovery attack is shown on 6 rounds of AES-192 and AES-256 as well as 13 rounds of CLEFIA-256.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">1 Introduction and background</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this article, we propose a novel extension of linear cryptanalysis: key recovery attacks based on linear approximations that hold true for exactly 50% of the input values. It can be considered as the counterpart of impossible differential cryptanalysis [2,6], though having many significant distinctions of both theoretical and technical nature. We apply it to balanced Feistel and generalized Feistel ciphers as well as to round-reduced AES.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Similarly to differential cryptanalysis [4], the original linear cryptanalysis is based on linear approximations with correlations significantly deviating from zero [16]. Unlike differential cryptanalysis though, for linear cryptanalysis there is only very limited work using linear approximations with correlation values of exactly zero [8, 12, 24]. These papers do not propose ways to find classes of zero correlation linear approximations valid for any key value.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Block ciphers have evolved to be the basic primitives of symmetric-key cryptography. Many sound and efficient cryptographic constructions can be built upon them, such as stream ciphers, message authentication codes, hash functions or entropy extractors for random number generators. Block ciphers are believed to be the best understood primitives of symmetric cryptography. Nevertheless, their security currently cannot be formally proven. Instead, we rely on cryptanalysis: careful evaluation against all the known weaknesses. Any significant advance in cryptanalytic techniques for block ciphers is of high relevance and might result in the re-evaluation of many designs.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Design strategies such as the wide trail design strategy [10] and the decorrelation theory [28] allow to construct block ciphers for which we can state with high confidence that they will resist crucial analysis methods such as standard differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis. However, these strategies provide only limited evidence of resistance against extensions of differential or linear cryptanalysis. Hence, it remains of interest to study extensions of these basic attacks as well as strategies to counter them.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we briefly recall some important concepts of linear cryptanalysis and introduce our notation. In Section 3 we present our main findings: linear approximations (hulls) with correlation zero for various cipher constructions. We explain how we can construct distinguishers and key-recovery attacks in Section 4 and illustrate this with two examples in Section 5. We conclude in Section 6.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">2 Correlation and linear cryptanalysis</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We briefly recall the concepts of correlation and linear cryptanalysis, based on [9,19].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2^n</span>  denote the finite field with  <span class="math">2^n</span>  elements, and let '+' denote the addition in this field. The cross-correlation between two functions  <span class="math">f,g:\\mathbb{F}_2^n\\to\\mathbb{F}_2</span>  is defined by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$C_{f,g}(u) = \\sum_{x \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^n} (-1)^{f(x) + g(x+u)}.</span>$
(1)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We call the <em>correlation</em> between two Boolean functions the quantity</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$C(f(x), g(x)) = 2^{-n}C_{f,g}(0).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It can be seen that with this definition, we have:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$C(f(x), g(x)) = 2 \\Pr_{x} (f(x) = g(x)) - 1.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We denote the scalar product of binary vectors by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$a^t x = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i x_i.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A function  <span class="math">h: \\mathbb{F}_2^m \\to \\mathbb{F}_2^n</span>  can be decomposed into n component functions. Linear cryptanalysis [16] is based on linear approximations. A linear approximation (v, u) of a function h has a correlation  <span class="math">C(u^th(x), v^tx)</span> , where u and v are called output and input selection patterns, respectively. The correlation values for all possible approximations can be grouped in the correlation matrix  <span class="math">\\mathbf{C}^h</span> , with entries given by:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathbf{C}_{uv} = \\mathbf{C}(u^t h(x), v^t x).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It can be seen that C(0,0) = 1 and  <span class="math">C(0,v^tx) = 0</span> , for all  <span class="math">v \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^m</span>  with  <span class="math">v \\neq 0</span> . Furthermore, we have the following property.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Property 1. A function  <span class="math">h: \\mathbb{F}_2^m \\to \\mathbb{F}_2^n</span>  is balanced, i.e., it reaches every output in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2^n</span>  equally often, if and only if  <span class="math">C(u^t h(x), 0) = 0</span> , for all  <span class="math">u \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^n</span>  with  <span class="math">u \\neq 0</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A proof can be found e.g. in [9]. If m = n, then we have that h is a permutation if and only if  <span class="math">C(u^t h(x), 0) = 0</span> , for all  <span class="math">u \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^n</span>  with  <span class="math">u \\neq 0</span> . The approximations (0, 0), (v, 0) and (0, u) of a permutation are called <em>trivial approximations</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">B: \\mathbb{F}_2^n \\to \\mathbb{F}_2^n</span>  be an iterative transformation on n bits, that is, an iterative application of r maps  <span class="math">f_i</span>  (rounds):</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$B = f_r \\circ f_{r-1} \\circ \\dots f_2 \\circ f_1</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">with  <span class="math">f_i: \\mathbb{F}_2^n \\to \\mathbb{F}_2^n</span>  for  <span class="math">i = 1, \\dots, r</span> . Daemen [9] proves (cf. [20]):</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathbf{C}^B = \\mathbf{C}^{f_r} \\times \\dots \\times \\mathbf{C}^{f_2} \\times \\mathbf{C}^{f_1}. \\tag{2}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A linear trail  <span class="math">U=(u_0,u_1,\\ldots,u_{r-1},u_r)</span>  is the concatenation of r 1-round approximations, where  <span class="math">(u_{i-1},u_i)</span>  is the approximation of  <span class="math">f_i</span> . Thus, each linear trail of B consists of n(r+1) bits. The correlation contribution  <span class="math">C_U</span>  of linear trail U is defined as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$C_U = \\prod_{i=1}^r C(u_i^t f_i(x), u_{i-1}^t x).</span>$
(3)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">From this and (2) it follows that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$C(\\beta^t B(x), \\alpha^t x) = \\sum_{U: u_0 = \\alpha, u_r = \\beta} C_U.</span>$
(4)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A linear approximation  <span class="math">(\\alpha, \\beta)</span>  of a block cipher is called a <em>linear hull</em> in [19]. In [19], <em>linear hull</em> is defined as the set of linear trails that a linear approximation of an iterated transformation is composed of. To emphasize this structure, linear approximation is identified with its linear hull.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">3 Linear hulls with zero correlation</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We construct zero-correlation linear hulls such that  <span class="math">C_U = 0</span>  for all linear trails U of the linear hull and for all key-dependent round functions of an iterated block cipher. To show that the correlation contribution  <span class="math">C_U</span>  of a linear trail is zero, it suffices to have only one combination of its intermediate linear selection patterns that exhibit correlation 0.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-3.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.1 Correlation over elementary operations</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Before studying the correlation of linear hulls over block ciphers, we will first treat the correlation of approximations over three basic operations which are often encountered as parts of block ciphers, namely the XOR-operation, the branching operation, and the key-dependent F-function  <span class="math">\\phi</span> , see also [1,16]. The following proposition will prove to be useful.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Proposition 1 (Approximation of a linear map</strong> [9]). For a linear map  <span class="math">h(x) = \\mathbf{M}x</span> , we have  <span class="math">C(u^t h(x), v^t x) = 1</span>  if  <span class="math">v = \\mathbf{M}^t u</span> , and  <span class="math">C(u^t h(x), v^t x) = 0</span>  if  <span class="math">v \\neq \\mathbf{M}^t u</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof.</em> Since  <span class="math">h(x) = \\mathbf{M}x</span> , we have  <span class="math">u^t h(x) = u^t(\\mathbf{M}x) = (\\mathbf{M}^t u)x</span> . Hence, if  <span class="math">v = \\mathbf{M}^t u</span> , then  <span class="math">\\mathbf{C}(u^t h(x), v^t x) = \\mathbf{C}(v^t x, v^t x) = 1</span> . On the other hand, if  <span class="math">v \\neq \\mathbf{M}^t u</span> , then  <span class="math">u^t h(x)</span>  and  <span class="math">v^t x</span>  are two different linear functions. The correlation between two different linear functions is always zero.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The next two lemmata follow easily from Proposition 1 (see also Fig. 1):</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lemma 1 (XOR operation [1]).</strong> Let  <span class="math">h(x_1, x_2) = x_1 + x_2</span> . Then  <span class="math">C(u^t h(x_1, x_2), v_1^t x_1 + v_2^t x_2) \\neq 0</span>  if and only if  <span class="math">u = v_1 = v_2</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lemma 2 (Branching operation [1]).</strong> Let h(x) = (x, x). Then  <span class="math">C((u_1, u_2)^t h(x), v^t x) \\neq 0</span>  if and only if  <span class="math">v = u_1 + u_2</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, we have:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lemma 3 (Invertible F-function).</strong> Let (v,u) be an approximation over an invertible function  <span class="math">\\phi</span> . Then  <span class="math">C(u^t\\phi(x),v^tx)\\neq 0</span>  only if u=v=0 or both u and v are nonzero.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof.</em> If exactly one of u, v equals 0, then we have a trivial approximation with correlation 0.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We consider 4 rounds of the AES (which is a 128-bit block cipher), i.e. an initial key addition followed by 3 full AES rounds and one final round, see the left-hand side of Fig. 4. One full AES round comprises the S-box layer SubBytes (SB) followed by linear diffusion layers ShiftRows (SR) and MixColumns (MC) as well as by the key addition AddRoundKey (AK). The final round consists of SubBytes (SB), ShiftRows (SR) as well as the AddRoundKey operation (AK). The SubBytes operation applies 16 copies of the same nonlinear 8-bit S-box to the state in parallel. Each MixColumns operation consists of 4 matrix-vector multiplications using a 4-by-4 MDS matrix over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2^8</span>  performed in parallel. ShiftRows provides diffusion between different columns. AddRoundKey consists of 16 additions with the round subkey performed in parallel over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2^8</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Theorem 3 (Zero-correlation linear hulls for 4 rounds of the AES). Let  <span class="math">\\Gamma</span>  and  <span class="math">\\Gamma&#x27;</span>  be 4-byte column selection patterns with exactly one nonzero byte. Then each of the linear hulls  <span class="math">(\\Gamma ||0||0||0, \\Gamma&#x27;||0||0||0)</span>  over 4 AES rounds has a zero correlation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof. It is known [10] that a linear trail over AES with  <span class="math">u_0 = (\\Gamma ||0||0||0)</span>  can have a correlation contribution different from zero only if  <span class="math">u_2</span>  has a nonzero value in each of the 16 bytes. At the same time, following the backward diffusion from the output over the final round and one full round, one can see that a linear trail with  <span class="math">u_4 = (\\Gamma&#x27; ||0||0||0)</span>  can have a correlation contribution different from zero only if  <span class="math">u_2</span>  is nonzero in exactly 4 bytes. Hence, all linear trails over 4 rounds of AES, with  <span class="math">u_0 = (\\Gamma ||0||0||0)</span>  and  <span class="math">u_4 = (\\Gamma&#x27; ||0||0||0)</span> , have correlation contribution zero. It follows that all linear hulls  <span class="math">(\\Gamma ||0||0||0, \\Gamma&#x27; ||0||0||0)</span>  have correlation zero. See the left-hand size of Fig. 4 for an example of an zero-correlation linear hull of this type.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The Matyas-Meyer-Oseas (MMO) construction transforms a block cipher into a compression function that can be used in a cryptographic hash function [17].</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">4 Key recovery attacks based on zero correlation</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we show how to evaluate the exact correlation value of a linear approximation more efficiently. Subsequently, we give the probability that a linear hull over a randomly chosen permutation has correlation zero. We conclude with a distinguisher for block ciphers based on zero-correlation linear hulls.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-4.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.1 Computing the correlation</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let x and y = f(x) be input and output of a permutation f. The straightforward way to evaluate the correlation is by evaluating the sum (1), going over all  <span class="math">2^n</span>  input-output pairs:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$C(\\beta^t y, \\alpha^t x) = \\frac{|\\{(x, y) | \\alpha^t x + \\beta^t y = 0\\}|}{2^{n-1}} - 1.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, it is not necessary to have all  <span class="math">2^n</span>  input-output pairs to compute C:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Proposition 2 (Efficient correlation evaluation).</strong> For any non-trivial linear approximation  <span class="math">(\\alpha, \\beta)</span>  of an n-bit permutation f, the correlation value C can be evaluated with  <span class="math">2^{n-1}</span>  input-output pairs (x, y) in one of the following ways:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$C(\\beta^t y, \\alpha^t x) = \\frac{|\\{(x, y) | \\alpha^t x = 0 \\text{ and } \\beta^t y = 0\\}|}{2^{n-2}} - 1</span>$
<span class="math">$= \\frac{|\\{(x, y) | \\alpha^t x = 1 \\text{ and } \\beta^t y = 1\\}|}{2^{n-2}} - 1.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof.</em> The  <span class="math">2^n</span>  input-output pairs of an n-bit permutation can be divided into the following four disjunct sets:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\begin{split} T_{00} &amp;= \\{(x,y) | \\alpha^t x = 0 \\text{ and } \\beta^t y = 0\\}, \\\\ T_{01} &amp;= \\{(x,y) | \\alpha^t x = 0 \\text{ and } \\beta^t y = 1\\}, \\\\ T_{10} &amp;= \\{(x,y) | \\alpha^t x = 1 \\text{ and } \\beta^t y = 0\\}, \\text{ and } \\\\ T_{11} &amp;= \\{(x,y) | \\alpha^t x = 1 \\text{ and } \\beta^t y = 1\\}. \\end{split}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since for a non-trivial linear approximation exactly one half of the inputs x yields  <span class="math">\\alpha^t x = 0</span>  and the other half gives  <span class="math">\\alpha^t x = 1</span> , one has:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Moreover, this also applies to the outputs y of the permutation, since it is invertible:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$|T_{01}| + |T_{11}| = 2^{n-1}. (8)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Now subtracting (7) from (8), one gets</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$|T_{00}| = |T_{11}|. (10)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Then by the definition of correlation, we obtain from (10):</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To distinguish a block cipher which exhibits a zero-correlation linear hull from a randomly drawn permutation, the adversary collects  <span class="math">2^{n-1}</span>  chosen plaintext-ciphertext pairs obtained under some fixed (unknown) key.

For the zero-correlation linear hull  <span class="math">(\\alpha, \\beta)</span> , the adversary evaluates the correlation  <span class="math">C(\\beta^t y, \\alpha^t x)</span>  using Proposition 2.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">5 Examples</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Algorithm 1 provides a distinguisher for a block cipher when a linear hull with a correlation of exactly 0 is given. Theorems 1-3 show zero-correlation linear hulls in many popular cipher constructions, which work for all values of the key. In this section, we show how to turn these into key recovery attacks for round-reduced AES-192, AES-256, and CLEFIA-256 [14], [25].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A crucial difference between zero-correlation cryptanalysis and impossible differential cryptanalysis is the following. For a key guess, once the adversary has a pair of texts with an impossible combination of input and output differences, he can deduce that this key guess is wrong, since the attacked cipher would not allow the impossible differential to go through.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the basic flavour of zero-correlation linear cryptanalysis we present in this paper, the adversary has to compute exactly (or with great accuracy) the value of the correlation in order to be able to tell whether the key guess results in a zero-correlation linear hull. With the basic methods of this paper, a full codebook or at least a half of it (see Proposition 2) is needed. As mentioned above, following the theoretical framework of zero correlation linear cryptanalysis introduced in this paper, the recent work [5] proposes a solution to this problem and requires only  <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}(2^n/\\sqrt{\\ell})</span>  texts, if  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  is the number of zero correlation linear hulls available.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the scope of this paper, however, we confine ourselves to illustrating the basic properties of zero correlation linear cryptanalysis at the examples of round-reduced AES-192, AES-256 and CLEFIA-256.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-5.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5.1 6 Rounds of AES-192 and AES-256</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Subsection 3.3 provides an introduction into the data transform of AES. AES-192 and AES-256 differ only in the key schedule (which is not of primary importance for the attacks here) and in the number of rounds.

    <p class="text-gray-300">The zero-correlation linear hull of Theorem 3 and Fig. 4 over 4 rounds of AES can be turned into a key recovery against 6 rounds of AES-192 and AES-256. The general attack procedure is to partially encrypt each plaintext and to partially decrypt the corresponding ciphertext with a guess of subkey bits. For each guess, one computes the relevant parts of the intermediate internal state and verifies if the remaining cipher exhibits the zero-correlation linear hull. The key-recovery attack can be outlined as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Once the one diagonal of the first subkey has been determined (Step 1), we switch to active bytes in another column of the input selection pattern for the zero-correlation linear hull and repeat the procedure (Steps 2 and 3). We use two more input selection patterns corresponding to two more diagonals of the first subkey. For each of these, we do not have to guess another diagonal of the last subkey and just stick to the previous output selection pattern of the zero-correlation linear hull.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For each of  <span class="math">2^{64}</span>  guesses in Step 1, one needs to evaluate the correlation values for two linear hulls to decrease the error probability. Due to Proposition 3, we estimate that a wrong guess will result in zero correlation value with probability about  <span class="math">2^{-63.3}</span> . For the correlations of two distinct linear hulls, this probability reduces to a negligible value of about  <span class="math">2^{-126.7}</span> , under the assumption that to have zero correlations for these two linear hulls under wrong keys are statistically independent events. The evaluation of the correlation for another linear hull can be performed in parallel.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The complexity of each of Steps 2 and 3 is about  <span class="math">2^{32} \\cdot 2^{128}/12 \\approx 2^{156.4}</span>  encryptions. The complexity of Step 4 is  <span class="math">2 \\cdot 2^{256-3\\cdot32} = 2^{161}</span>  encryptions. Thus, the computational complexity of the full 6-round attack is dominated by Step 1 and can be estimated as  <span class="math">2^{64} \\cdot 2^{128}/12 \\approx 2^{188.4}</span>  encryptions and is the same for both AES-192 and AES-256. The data complexity is  <span class="math">2^{128}</span>  plaintext-ciphertext pairs (cf. e.g.  <span class="math">2^{118.8}</span>  time and  <span class="math">2^{2^{113.8}}</span>  data to attack 7 rounds of AES-192 as well as  <span class="math">2^{227.8}</span>  time and  <span class="math">2^{111.1}</span>  data complexity to attack 8 rounds of AES-256 in [15] with an impossible-differential key recovery). A similar 5-round chosen-ciphertext or chosen-plaintext attack would reduce the computational complexity to about  <span class="math">2^{156.3}</span>  encryptions and the data requirements to  <span class="math">2^{127}</span>  texts.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Here, for the sake of simplicity, we omit many possible optimizations, since they are not able to increase the number of attacked rounds for AES-192 and AES-256. At this point, our goal is to demonstrate the applicability of the new attack vector to some relevant ciphers only.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-5.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5.2 13 rounds of CLEFIA-256</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Based on the zero-correlation linear hull (a||0||0||0, 0||0||0||a) of Theorem 1, Table 1, and Fig. 6 over 9 rounds for CLEFIA-type structures, we demonstrate a zero-correlation key-recovery attack against 13 rounds of CLEFIA-256.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">CLEFIA-256 is a block cipher with a 128-bit block and a 256-bit key which has a 4-line type-II Generalized Feistel structure depicted in Fig. 6. The number of rounds for CLEFIA-256 is 26. Each line has 4 bytes. F-functions of CLEFIA-256 consist of a subkey addition followed by an S-box layer (4 8-bit S-boxes applied in parallel) and a 4-by-4 MDS diffusion matrix over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2^8</span>  (similarly to linear diffusion of AES).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The general attack procedure is similar to that for the attack on 6-round AES-256: We guess all key values needed to compute the active intermediate values at the input and output selection patterns of the zero-correlation linear hull. In our attack, the 9-round zero-correlation linear hull covers rounds 3 to 11. The procedure can be outlined as follows:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Guess 4 32-bit secret-key values:</li>
    </ol>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>The XOR of the 32-bit round-key chunk and 32-bit whitening-key chunk in round 1 to predict the output of one F-function in round 1,</li>
    </ul></li>
      <li><p class="text-gray-300">The 32-bit round-key chunk to predict the output of one F-function in round 2,</p></li>
      <li><p class="text-gray-300">The XOR of the 32-bit round-key chunk and 32-bit whitening-key chunk in round 12 to predict the input of one F-function in round 12,</p></li>
      <li><p class="text-gray-300">The 32-bit round-key chunk to predict the input of one F-function in round 13.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="sec-misc-7" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2. For each guess:</h3>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>(a) Partially encrypt each of 2<sup>128</sup> plaintexts two rounds forwards and partially decrypt each of the corresponding 2<sup>128</sup> ciphertexts two rounds backwards.</li>
      <li>(b) Evaluate the correlation for three zero-correlation linear hulls of the type given in Fig. 6. The right guess will have zero correlation for all three linear hulls.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We evaluate the correlation for three distinct linear hulls to reduce the error probability for each of the  <span class="math">2^{128}</span>  guesses to about  <span class="math">2^{-190}</span>  (again, assuming that to have zero correlation for these three linear hulls under wrong keys are statistically independent events). The computational complexity of the 13-round attack amounts to  <span class="math">2^{128} \\cdot 2^{128} \\cdot \\frac{2}{13} \\approx 2^{253.3}</span>  encryptions. The data complexity is  <span class="math">2^{128}</span>  plaintext-ciphertext pairs (compare to  <span class="math">2^{212}</span>  time and  <span class="math">2^{120.3}</span>  data in [27] for a 14-round impossible differential key-recovery attack on CLEFIA-256). A similar 11-round chosen-ciphertext or chosen-plaintext attack would have a computational complexity of about  <span class="math">2^{155.5}</span>  encryptions and a data complexity of  <span class="math">2^{127}</span>  texts.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">6 Conclusions</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The main contribution of this article belongs to the theory of cryptanalysis of block ciphers. In this article, we have introduced zero-correlation linear cryptanalysis, a novel extension of linear cryptanalysis. We demonstrate linear hulls with a correlation of exactly 0 for many cipher structures including reduced-round variants of AES as well as balanced and generalized Feistel networks (CLEFIA, Skipjack, and CAST256). This extension of linear cryptanalysis bears some similarities to impossible differential cryptanalysis and can be seen as its counterpart in the domain of linear cryptanalysis, though being essentially different. We propose a key recovery approach based on zero-correlation linear approximations and apply it to 6 rounds of AES-192 and AES-256 as well as 13 rounds of CLEFIA-256.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Following the introduction of the new technique of zero-correlation linear cryptanalysis in this paper, the recent work [5] proposes a statistical technique to reduce the data complexity of the key recovery, given many zero correlation linear approximations. Moreover, [5] demonstrates that the approach of zero correlation linear cryptanalysis can be used to derive best attacks in the classical single secret key setting published to date on round-reduced TEA and XTEA.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This makes zero correlation linear cryptanalysis, initially introduced in this paper, one of the major cryptanalytic techniques available today for attacking and evaluating ciphers.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">Recent progress on NFS imposed a new estimation of the security of pairings. In this work we study the
best attacks against some of the most popular pairings and propose new key sizes using an analysis which is more
precise than the analysis in a recent article of Menezes, Sarkar and Singh. We also select pairing-friendly curves for
standard security levels.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">3 The spectrum of possibilities for an attack on the field side</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">An attacker who uses an algorithm of Index calculus type can make a series of choices: decide which algorithm and variant to use, make practical improvements, select polynomials, and optimize the main parameters. In this section we explain what are the reasonable choices for an attacker and give arguments to eliminate other choices.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-3.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.1 Choice of algorithm</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let us make a list of the algorithms which can be implemented on a classical computer.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We discard the FFS algorithm [Adl94,AH99,JL02,JL06] and its pinpointing variant [Jou13a] by estimating the size of the factor base. Indeed, when the target is  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^k}</span> , the factor base of FFS is formed of all the monic polynomials  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p[x]</span>  of degree less than a parameter b. This has been confirmed by implementations of FFS [JL06,HSW+10,HSST12] and pinpointing [Jou13a,SS16a]. Hence the factor base has at least p elements and then the linear algebra step has a cost of at least  <span class="math">p^2</span>  operations, which is more than the security on the curve side evaluated to  <span class="math">p^{\\frac{1}{2}}</span>  operations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We also discard the MNFS variants, i.e. the variants of NFS in which more than two sides are used. Indeed, the asymptotic complexity is close to that of NFS ([KB16, Table 2] so the &quot;o(1)-less&quot; extrapolation leads us to results which are similar to those of the classical case (see Figure 1). Detrey [Det14] and Lenstra and al. [KBL14] made proof-of-concept implementations of FFS and NFS for factoring, which are similar to NFS for discrete logarithms. Their results seem to show that the crossing point between classical and MNFS variants of NFS is around 1000 bits, but the gain is small, say less than 2 bits of security, so that we can ignore it in this article.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The three variants of NFS, classical [Gor93,Sch93,JL03], TNFS [Sch00,BGK15] and JLSV [JLSV06], can be seen as particular cases of exTNFS [KB16], which remains the only algorithm to consider.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">When p can be written as P(u)/v, for some polynomial  <span class="math">P \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]</span>  and some integers u and v (as it is the case for pairing applications), the polynomial selection is done differently and one of f and g has small coefficients. To emphasize this difference we give a different name to the algorithm by adding the letter S: the &quot;special&quot; variant of NFS is called SNFS, the special variant of exTNFS is called SexTNFS, the corresponding variant of TNFS is STNFS and the special variant of JLSV will be called S-JLSV or simply Joux-Pierrot. This case encompasses but is not restricted to low-weight primes p, e. g. in an article [Sch10] discussing the complexity of NFS on numbers which are midway between having a general form (NFS) and a polynomial form.(SNFS), these numbers are described as &quot;low weigh numbers&quot;.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In order to fix the notations we recall the <strong>SexTNFS algorithm</strong> [KB16]:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Although the complexity of NFS for DLP in F<sup>p</sup> hasn't changed for almost 30 years, its real-life speed has been improving continuously. In the jargon of the NFS community an improvement which changes only the o(1) term in the complexity is called a practical improvement.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">3.2.1 Filtering. If an ideal occurs in a single relation then we can erase this ideal and its relation from the matrix. Thanks to the exceeding number of relations compared to the cardinality of the factor base, one can erase rows and do linear operations on the rows in order to create new singletons <a href="#page-24-19">[CH02,</a> Ch 3]. Table <a href="#page-6-0">3</a> summarizes how does the filtering behave in practice. It is hard to compare the different rows of the table because the authors of different records made different choices, some of which collected much more relations than needed (oversieved) and hence helped the filtering step reduce considerably the matrix.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 3. Behavior of filtering in practice</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We made an asymptotic estimation of the number of ideals which might be used to reduce the matrix and we obtained the following statement.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Conjecture 1.</em> In the filtering step of NFS one reduces the matrix by a factor (log B) 1+o(1), where B is the smoothness bound.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Justification:</em> Let q be an ideal in the factor base of NFS lying above a prime q and let N denote the size of the norms product and B the smoothness bound. We shall argue that the following statements are true:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>If q &lt; B/(log B) 1+ with &gt; 0 then q occurs in a number of relations which tends to infinity as B and N go to infinity.</li>
    </ol></li>
      <li><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>If q &gt; B/(log B) <sup>1</sup>&minus; with &gt; 0 then q will occur in a number of relations which tends to 0 as B and N go to infinity.</li>
    </ol></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The sieving domain has B<sup>2</sup> elements (parameter tuning in NFS implies E = B where E is the square root of the number of sieved pairs <a href="#page-24-20">[BLJP93]</a>) and a proportion of 1/q are divisible by q. They produce relations if the cofactor of size N/q is B-smooth, for which we have no proven formula, but which is approximated by the proportion of integers in the interval [1, N/q] which are B-smooth. Due to the theorem of Canfield, Erdos and Pomerance [ &uml; <a href="#page-24-21">CEP83]</a> this proportion is &rho; log(N/q) log B where &rho; is Dickman's function, i.e. the function such that &rho;(v) = 1 for v &le; 1 and &rho; 0 (v) = &minus;&rho;(v &minus; 1)/v for v &gt; 1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">number of relations where q occurs
<span class="math">$\\approx B^2/q \\cdot \\rho\\left(\\frac{\\log(N/q)}{\\log B}\\right)</span>$
.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Recall that in NFS we set B so that &rho; log N log B <sup>&minus;</sup><sup>1</sup> = B (once again see <a href="#page-24-20">[BLJP93]</a>). We put v = log N log B , so that we have log B = v log v, log N = v 2 log v and q &gt; B/v1+2 (resp. q &lt; B/v<sup>1</sup>&minus;2 ). We replace all variables on the right hand side by their expressions in terms of v and obtain that its logarithm is equivalent to v 1+ &minus; v. It tends to &infin; if &gt; 0 so the ideals of norm  <span class="math">q &lt; B/(\\log B)</span>  occur in a very large number of relations and are unlikely to create singletons, so they are not erased during filtering. The right hand side tends to  <span class="math">-\\infty</span>  if  <span class="math">\\epsilon &lt; 0</span>  so the ideals of norm  <span class="math">q &gt; B/\\log(B)</span>  occur in almost no relations, and are very likely to be used during filtering.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Hence the filtering erases most of the ideals of norm larger than  <span class="math">B/(\\log B)^{1+o(1)}</span>  and keeps all but a negligible fraction of the others, so that the matrix size is reduced by a factor  <span class="math">(\\log B)^{1+o(1)}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It seems then plausible that the filtering gain is a constant times log(B), and by comparing it with Table 3 we model the gain by  <span class="math">log_2 B</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>3.2.2 Exploiting automorphisms.</strong> Record computations with FFS [HSW<sup>+</sup>10,HSST12] and NFS [BGGM15a] showed that if the target field is of the form  <span class="math">p^{\\kappa\\eta}</span>  for two integers  <span class="math">\\eta</span>  and  <span class="math">\\kappa</span>  so that  <span class="math">\\kappa</span>  is small, then one can gain a factor  <span class="math">\\kappa</span>  in the sieve and a factor  <span class="math">\\kappa^2</span>  in the linear algebra.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Kim and Barbulescu [KB16] explained that one has a similar gain in SexTNFS, where  <span class="math">\\kappa</span>  is to be replaced by  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span> , the number of automorphisms of h which fix g times the number of automorphisms of g. If  <span class="math">\\kappa=1</span>  and h has  <span class="math">\\eta</span>  automorphisms then the exact number of automorphisms is  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}=\\eta</span> , e.g.  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}=\\ell-1</span>  if  <span class="math">h=\\Phi_\\ell</span> , the  <span class="math">\\ell</span> -th cyclotomic polynomial, for some prime  <span class="math">\\ell</span> . If  <span class="math">\\kappa=2</span>  one doubles the number of automorphisms thanks to the automorphisms of g. For example if  <span class="math">h=\\Phi_7</span>  and  <span class="math">g=x^2+\\alpha x+\\beta+t^4+t^2+t-u</span>  for some integers  <span class="math">\\alpha</span> ,  <span class="math">\\beta</span>  then  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}=6</span>  because any automorphism in the set  <span class="math">\\{\\tau^i\\sigma^j, 0\\leq i\\leq 1, 0\\leq j\\leq 2\\}</span>  can be used (here  <span class="math">\\sigma:t\\mapsto t^2</span>  and  <span class="math">\\tau:x\\mapsto -\\alpha-x</span> ). Finally, if  <span class="math">\\kappa=3</span>  and  <span class="math">\\eta=4</span>  an attacker might use  <span class="math">h=\\phi_8</span>  and find polynomials g which have three automorphisms, so for a worst case analysis we count  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}=12</span> .</p>

      <h3 id="sec-3.3" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.3 Selection of polynomials</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The polynomial selection consists of selecting h, f and g.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>3.3.1</strong> Choice of h. The polynomial  <span class="math">h \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]</span>  has two constraints, its degree is  <span class="math">\\eta</span>  and it is irreducible modulo p. Among the possible choices we select those having small norms for  <span class="math">N_f</span>  and  <span class="math">N_g</span> , which generally corresponds to the case when h has small coefficients. In all examples we could select h with coefficients in  <span class="math">\\{0, -1, 1\\}</span>  and experiments confirmed that the best choice is never much better than  <span class="math">h = t^{\\eta} - t - 1</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Section 3.2.2 we saw that in order to use the Galois automorphisms the attacker has to find a polynomial h with non-trivial automorphisms. We ran an exhaustive search on the polynomials in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}[x]</span>  of degree less than 19 having coefficients less than 6 in absolute value. In this set, the only polynomials that have automorphisms of order different from 2 are those listed in Table 4.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this article we focus on families of pairings where p is parametrized, then one choice of polynomials is by far the most natural.

The attacker cannot use the fastest versions of NFS (SNFS, STNFS, SexTNFS, Joux-Pierrot) unless he finds three polynomials,  <span class="math">T(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x,y]</span>  and  <span class="math">U, V \\in \\mathbb{Z}(x)</span>  whose coefficients are bounded by an absolute constant, so that p = T(U(u), V(u)) for some integer u, in which case he sets</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$f = T(x)</span>$
and  <span class="math">g = V(u)x - U(u)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the case of SexTNFS, the coefficients of f occur at large powers in the norms and hence we can restrict the search to very small constants. We ran the exhaustive search and obtained that the only alternative choices are f = P(x-1) for KSS 16, f = P(x-2) for KSS 18 and  <span class="math">f = 4x^4 - 4x^3 + 12x^2 - 10x + 7</span>  and g = x - (3u+1) for BN. In the rest of the security evaluation we considered the alternative choices together with the natural ones.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>3.3.3 Optimization.</strong> Murphy [Mur98] introduced a map  <span class="math">\\alpha:\\mathbb{Q}[x]\\to\\mathbb{R}</span>  which allows to decide which are the best polynomials for NFS. Barbulescu and Lachand [BL17] proved, when f is quadratic of fundamental negative discriminant, that for a random pair of relatively prime integers the norm  <span class="math">N=\\mathrm{Res}_x(a-bx,f)</span>  has the same probability to be B-smooth (for a parameter B) as a random integer less than  <span class="math">e^{\\alpha(f)}N</span> . Because of the uncertainty on  <span class="math">\\alpha</span>  we cannot predict the exact cost of a DLP computation with NFS. In the previous paragraph we saw that in the case of parametrized pairings we only have one or two choices of f and g. For each choice we verify directly that  <span class="math">\\alpha(f)\\approx 0</span>  whereas for linear polynomials the value of  <span class="math">\\alpha</span>  is constant equal to 0.56..., which is also the average value of  <span class="math">\\alpha</span>  on all polynomials [BL17].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Given a field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}</span>  where the characteristic is parametrized by a polynomial P(u)/v of degree d, we decided to use SexTNFS with  <span class="math">f=P(x^\\kappa+S(t,x))</span>  and  <span class="math">g=x^\\kappa+S(t,x)-u</span>  for some polynomial S of degree in x less than n. We also decided to use, if possible, h from Table 4 and otherwise  <span class="math">h=t^{n/\\kappa}-t-1</span>  because it is the simplest one and then the one providing the smallest norms. This choice is the best possible for the attacker. At this point we need to decide which value of  <span class="math">\\kappa</span>  to use and to optimize parameters A and B.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-4.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.1 Choice of <span class="math">\\kappa</span> .</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">According to [KB16, Section 4.1] the parameter  <span class="math">\\kappa</span>  is chosen to minimize the norms product  <span class="math">N_f N_g \\approx E^{(d+1)\\kappa} Q^{\\frac{1}{d\\kappa}}</span> , where E is the square root of the cardinality of the sieve space and Q is  <span class="math">p^n</span> . This corresponds to</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It was useful for us to guess the optimal value of  <span class="math">\\kappa</span> , which is the most likely to be optimal, but we do nevertheless an exhaustive search.

    <p class="text-gray-300">As before B denotes the smoothness bound and A the bound on the coefficients of the sieved polynomials. A pair of values is valid if the sieve produces enough relations, so we need to estimate the number of relations. The sieving space is formed of the pairs a(t), b(t) in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}(t)/h</span>  so that  <span class="math">\\deg a, \\deg b \\leq \\eta - 1</span> . If  <span class="math">\\mu(t)</span>  is a root of unity of the number field of h then the pairs  <span class="math">(\\mu a, \\mu b)</span>  and (a, b) give the same multiplicative relation. In Section 3.1 we restricted  <span class="math">a_0</span>  to positive values to account for the unit -1, here the sieving space shrinks further by the number of roots of unity divided by two.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">sieving space=
<span class="math">$(2A+1)^{2\\eta}/(2w)</span>$
,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where w is the index of  <span class="math">\\{1,-1\\}</span>  in the group of roots of unity. By a Monte Carlo integration (Appendix  <span class="math">\\bf A</span> ) we estimate the bit size of the norms: we considered random tuples  <span class="math">(a_0,\\ldots,a_{\\eta-1},b_0,\\ldots,b_{\\eta-1})</span>  each of the components being uniformly chosen in the interval [-A,A]. We call bit size of the norms the arithmetic mean of the bits sizes of the norms for each tuple in a sample of 25600 tuples (see Appendix  <span class="math">\\bf A</span>  for more details). We emphasize that we average the logarithms  <span class="math">\\log_2(N_f)</span>  and  <span class="math">\\log_2(N_g)</span> , rather than  <span class="math">N_f</span>  and  <span class="math">N_g</span> , because the logarithms are used to compute the smoothness probabilities  <span class="math">p_f = \\rho\\left(\\frac{\\log_2 N_f}{\\log_2 B}\\right)</span>  and  <span class="math">p_g = \\rho\\left(\\frac{\\log_2 N_g}{\\log_2 B}\\right)</span> . This gives us the total number of relations which is</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">relations = (sieving space)
<span class="math">$\\cdot p_f \\cdot p_q</span>$
.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The factor base is formed of the prime ideals of norm less than B in the number fields of f and g, so the cardinality of the factor base is asymptotically equal to  <span class="math">2B/\\log(B)</span> . In some record computations the number of relations is less than the cardinality of the factor base, e.g. 68% in [AFK+07], but for simplicity and without changing the complexity results by more than one bit, we consider that the attacker must collect at least as many relations as elements in the factor base. Hence the validity condition is</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">
<span class="math">$\\frac{(2A+1)^{2\\eta}}{2w} \\cdot p_f \\cdot p_g \\ge \\frac{2B}{\\log(B)}.</span>$
(1)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Due to Galois automorphisms (see the discussion in Section 3.2.2)  <span class="math">\\frac{2B}{A \\log(B)}</span>  non-conjugate relations can be used to obtain  <span class="math">2B/\\log(B)</span>  relations (where  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span>  is the number of automorphisms of h times the number of automorphisms of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}/\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}</span>  which fix f and g). Equivalently, we collect only  <span class="math">\\frac{2B}{A \\log(B)}</span>  relations and we keep one ideal in each class of conjugacy so that the cardinality of the reduced factor base becomes  <span class="math">\\frac{2B}{A \\log(B)}</span> . Each relation is obtained on average after testing  <span class="math">p_f^{-1}p_g^{-1}</span>  elements of the sieving space, so the total number of enumerated (or sieved) elements is  <span class="math">2B/(A \\log(B)p_fp_g)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The ratio between the real cost of the sieve and the number of tuples enumerated (or sieved) in the sieve is hard to evaluate so we call it  <span class="math">c_{\\text{sieve}}</span> . According to Table 6,  <span class="math">c_{\\text{sieve}}</span>  is almost constant in various computations realized with various variants of NFS. We stay on the safe side and model  <span class="math">c_{\\text{sieve}}</span>  to be a constant equal to 1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One might ask if in the case of the new variants, TNFS, exTNFS and SexTNFS, one can approximate  <span class="math">c_{\\text{sieve}}</span>  by its value in the classical variants. Examples abound where new attacks with better asymptotic complexity were actually slower in practice beacuse of hidden constants [MSS16]. In a recent record computation [GGMT17, Section 2.1], Gr&eacute;my, Guillevic and Morain sieved a dimension three lattice with  <span class="math">A = 2^{16}</span>  in 359 CPU hours, which accounts for  <span class="math">c_{\\text{sieve}} \\approx 27</span> . This value can decrease with the size of A and thaks to practical improvements. However, it is safe to assume that  <span class="math">c_{\\text{sieve}}</span>  will remain  <span class="math">\\geq 1</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the rest of the analysis we consider  <span class="math">c_{\\text{sieve}} = 1</span>  which means that the sieving time equals the number of elements of the sieving domain. Finally we obtain</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The size of the matrix sent to filtering is  <span class="math">2B/\\mathcal{A}\\log(B)</span> .

The number of non-zero entries per row in the reduced matrix varies between 100 and 200 in all records that we consider and we will approximate it by 128.

      <h3 id="sec-4.3" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.3 Comparison to the analysis of Menezes, Sarkar and Singh</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">At this point of the article we can explain the difference between our analysis and that of [MSS16].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>4.3.1</strong> Impreciseness in the estimation of  <span class="math">\\log_2 N_f</span>  and  <span class="math">\\log_2 N_g</span> . In order to estimate the bit size of the norms  <span class="math">N_f</span>  and  <span class="math">N_g</span> , Menezes, Sarkar and Singh used the mathematical upper bounds. In an experiment we computed the distribution of the bit sizes of norms, and we present our results in Figure 4.3.1. A script to reproduce the experiment on the same sample of 1000 pairs  <span class="math">(\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b})</span>  is available online at [BD17]. The target is the 3072-bit finite field corresponding to a BN curve in Section 5.2. The bitsize  <span class="math">\\log_2 N_f</span>  (in the left) varies between 175 and 244, which is much smaller than 740, the mathematical upper bound. Similarly,  <span class="math">\\log_2 N_g</span>  varies between 417 and 472 which is much smaller than 853, the mathematical upper bound. In a similar experiment [MSS16, Table 3], Menezes, Sarkar and Singh observed a similar</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">    <img src="_page_10_Figure_10.jpeg" alt="" class="my-4 max-w-full" />
</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Fig. 2. Experimental distribution of  <span class="math">\\log_2 N_f</span>  (in the left) and  <span class="math">\\log_2 N_g</span>  (in the right) on the sieving domain of SexTNFS. The vertical line shows the mathematical upper bound used in [MSS16].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">situation: &quot;It is possible that a non-negligible fraction of these have norms close to the upper bounds. Our experiments</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">only indicate that this fraction is less than 1/1000&quot;. This corroborates with our results but the figure shows at which point the upper bound used in [MSS16] is far away from 99.9% of the values. We remark however that their method is adapted for a practitioner to convince himself that a NFS computation is feasible, because it gives an upper bound on the complexity, but it cannot be used to obtain security estimations which ideally would require a lower bound.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This difference is well known to practitioners of factoring and discrete logarithm. Hence, the CADO-NFS software package  <span class="math">[BGI^+14]</span>  sacrifices a few percents of relations by skipping the pairs  <span class="math">(\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b})</span>  having large norms. For example, from file params.c90 in the parameters directory of CADO-NFS we learn that &quot;lambda0/lambda1 is the early abort sieving parameter, and if [...] the approximation of the log of the remaining cofactor is larger than lambda times lpb, we reject&quot;, where lambda0, lambda1 and lpb are parameters which control the percentage of relations we sacrifice. In this light, the size of the largest 0.1% of the norms has no impact on the behavior of NFS implementations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>4.3.2 Other differences.</strong> Moreover, the analysis of Menezes, Sarkar and Singh in Section 6.3 does not mention a series of aspects which can decrease the running time of SexTNFS.</p>

There is no evidence that the reduction factor is a constant and in Section 3.2.1 we give heuristic arguments that it is approximatively  <span class="math">\\log_2 B</span> .

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">5 Estimating SexTNFS complexity on the most popular pairings</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we use the results of the previous section to estimate the security level provided by a given finite field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^k}</span>  when p is parametrized by a polynomial P(x).</p>

      <h3 id="sec-5.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5.1 Summarizing the process for computing SexTNFS cost</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let us first summarize the way to estimate the complexity of the SexTNFS algorithm. It is made of 4 steps.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Step 1: Parameter selection. The first choice to be made is the one of the  <span class="math">\\kappa</span> . All divisors of k must be tested so that the following steps are done once for each  <span class="math">\\kappa</span> . However, the first values to try are the ones in Table 5. Then one has to choose the polynomial h such that  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span>  is as large as possible and h is as simple as possible (small and few coefficients) and the polynomials f and g to define the commutative diagram given in the introduction. The details on the ways to choose these polynomials are given in Section 3.3. In this step, we also determine the number of roots of unity divided by two w and the number of automorphisms  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span> .</li>
      <li>Step 2: Choice of the bounds A and B. These bounds will define the number of enumerated relations and the size of the factor basis so they have a direct impact on the complexity. As already explained they must be chosen to minimize the cost in Equation 2 under the condition in Equation 1. This optimization problem will be solve by brute force because we do not need a very high accuracy. We first enumerate only integer values of  <span class="math">\\log_2 A \\in [1, \\frac{100}{\\eta}]</span>  and  <span class="math">\\log_2 B \\in [1, 100]</span>  because the cost is lower bounded by  <span class="math">(A^{2\\eta} + B^2)/1000</span>  which is more than  <span class="math">2^{192}</span>  for larger values of A and B. We call  <span class="math">\\log_2 A_0</span>  and  <span class="math">\\log_2 B_0</span>  the optimum of this integer search. In a second time we test</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">all values of  <span class="math">\\log_2 A</span>  in the set  <span class="math">\\{\\log_2 A_0 + i/100 \\mid i \\text{ integer in } [-100, 100]\\}</span>  and all values of  <span class="math">\\log_2 B</span>  in the set  <span class="math">\\{\\log_2 B_0 + j/5 \\mid j \\text{ integer in } [-25, 25]\\}</span> . When the optimal values of A is less than 10, we switch from enumerating values of  <span class="math">\\log_2 A</span>  to enumerating integer values of A.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Step 3: Verification. At this point we know what is the security level. For completeness we continue by verifying once again by hand that the values of A and B, which were found by a non-proven program, are indeed valid parameters for SexTNFS by checking that the number of relations is larger than the cardinality of the factor base.</li>
      <li>Step 4: Conclusion. We inject A and B in Equation 2 an verify once again that the cost of SexTNFS is that found
by our unproven solver of the optimization problem.</li>
    </ul>

      <h3 id="sec-5.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5.2 Example: a BN curve where the finite field has 3072 bits</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One of the most popular BN curve is the one associated to  <span class="math">u = -2^{62} - 2^{55} - 1</span>  which was evaluated to 128 bits of security before the recent developments on NFS. Let us follow Section 5.1 to estimate its real security level.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Step 1: Parameter selection. We decide to use the SexTNFS algorithm with  <span class="math">\\kappa=2</span>  and  <span class="math">\\eta=6</span>  because it gives the best result from the viewpoint of the attacker. The intermediate field will be defined by  <span class="math">h=t^6-t^3-t-1</span>  which is irreducible modulo p. Indeed the cyclotomic polynomials  <span class="math">\\Phi_7, \\Phi_9, \\Phi_{14}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\Phi_{18}</span>  are not irreducible in this case and h is the &quot;smallest&quot; irreducible polynomial (it has only 4 non-zero coefficients which moreover equal  <span class="math">\\pm 1</span> ). We tried several polynomials and found that  <span class="math">x^2+t-u</span>  is irreducible in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^6}=\\mathbb{F}_p[t]/h(t)</span>  so that  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}=\\mathbb{F}_{p^6}[x]/(x^2+t-u)</span> . Hence we can take  <span class="math">f=P(x^2+t)</span>  (where P is the polynomial parametrizing p given in Section 2.1) and  <span class="math">g=x^2+t-u</span> . In this case, we have no non-trivial roots of unity (w=1) and A=2 because g has degree two (as explained in Section 3.2.2).</li>
      <li>Step 2: Choice of the bounds A and B. As explained in Section 5.1, we applied Steps 3 and 4 for many values of A and B to find that  <span class="math">\\log_2 A = 7.36</span>  and  <span class="math">\\log_2(B) = 57</span>  are minimizing the cost given by the Equation 2.</li>
      <li>Step 3: Verification. The total number of tuples in the sieving space is  <span class="math">(2A+1)^{2\\eta}/(2w)</span> , where w=1 is the number of roots of unity of the number field of h, divided by 2, so the size of the sieving space is  <span class="math">2^{99.45}</span> . By Monte Carlo integration (Appendix A) we estimate the norms on the two sides of the commutative diagram and then one can approximate the smoothness probability using Dickman's function</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\log_2(N_f) \\approx 414.7 \\Rightarrow \\rho\\left(\\frac{\\log_2(N_f)}{\\log_2(B)}\\right) \\approx 2^{-21.41} \\ \\ \\text{and} \\ \\ \\log_2(N_g) \\approx 460.8 \\Rightarrow \\rho\\left(\\frac{\\log_2(N_g)}{\\log_2(B)}\\right) \\approx 2^{-25.30}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Hence the number of relations is approximatively  <span class="math">2^{99.45-21.41-25.30} \\approx 2^{52.74}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">On the other hand, the cardinality of the factor base is approximatively  <span class="math">2B/\\log(B) \\approx 2^{52.70}</span> , which is less than the number of relations, so we have enough relations (Equation 1 is satisfied).</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Step 4: Conclusion. Equation 2 gives a security level of 99.69 bits. The details are as follows: the number of relations we need to collect is  <span class="math">2^{51.70}</span>  and each relation is obtained after testing on average  <span class="math">2^{21.41+25.30} = 2^{46.71}</span>  pairs (a,b); hence the cost of the sieve is  <span class="math">c_{\\text{sieve}}2^{51.70+46.71} \\approx 2^{98.41}</span>  assuming  <span class="math">c_{\\text{sieve}} \\approx 1</span> ; on the other hand, the filtering stage allows to reduce the matrix size by a factor around  <span class="math">\\log_2 B = 57</span> , its new size being  <span class="math">N = 2^{51.70}/57 \\approx 2^{46.87}</span> ; the cost of the algorithms of sparse linear algebra is given by  <span class="math">2^5N^2 = 2^{98.73}</span>  times the cost of an addition modulo p, which counts here for an elementary operation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, we get the overall cost by adding the cost of the relation collection and the one of the linear algebra  <span class="math">:2^{98.65} + 2^{98.73} = 2^{99.69}</span>  which means that the BN curve used in most of the existing implementations ensures no more than the 100-bits security level.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-5.3" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5.3 General results and recommendations</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The goal of this section is to determine the required size of the finite field involved in the pairings given in Section 2 to ensure the 128, 192 and 256-bits security levels. For this, we follow the strategy given in Section 5.1 for each family of curves making at each step the most favorable choice (for the attacker). For example we assumed that the number of automorphisms  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span>  is maximal. If the parameter u (and therefore p) is selected such that the attacker cannot use the best polynomials listed in Table 7 then we observed an increase of up to 3 bits of security (Sections 7.1.1 and 7.1.2).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, for the purpose of general recommendations, we consider that the attacker can use the best polynomials. The results are given in Tables <a href="#page-13-2">8,</a> <a href="#page-13-3">9</a> and <a href="#page-13-4">10,</a> which then contain our recommendations for the size of p <sup>k</sup> where k is the embedding degree. Note that in the case of KSS16 and KSS18 curves for 128 bits of security the parameter A is very small (A = 9), and one might want to compute the proportion of elements in the sieving space having each possible value of norms bit size. In every other case in this article we checked that such a precise analysis arrives to the same results as our analysis.</p>

This was done in Section 5.3 and the results are given in Table 8. We must also take care that the r-torsion subgroup of the elliptic curve involved in the pairing computation ensures the 128-bits security level. For example, this is the limiting factor in the KSS cases. Then, for each family, we know the size of the curve parameter u that should be used to ensure the 128-bits security level (Table 11) in the general case. These sizes guarantee the security level as soon as the parameter u has the required bit size.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Table 11.</strong> Bit size of the parameter u ensuring the 128-bits security level</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The second step is to generate the best possible parameter u having the good bit size. Let us start with the generation of a BN curve.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-6.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">6.1 New BN parameter for level 128</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The way to build the parameter u is detailed in [DMHR15]: it should be chosen sparse and congruent to 7 or 11 mod 12 so that building  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}</span>  can be done via  <span class="math">Y^6-(1+\\mathbf{i})</span>  over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}=\\mathbb{F}_p[\\mathbf{i}]</span> . We also impose the condition that the curve obtained is twist-secure [VLFR08] which means that p+1+t should have a 256-bits prime factor (where t is the trace of the Frobenius as usual). We then performed an exhaustive search on u having increasing Hamming weight. There are no results of weight 2. We found some values having Hamming weight 3 but not satisfying the congruence. More precisely, the extension tower should be built using  <span class="math">\\sqrt{-5}</span>  which is much less interesting in terms of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}</span>  arithmetic. Finally, we found the value  <span class="math">u=2^{114}+2^{101}-2^{14}-1</span>  which satisfies all the required conditions. The curve E defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  by</p>

      <h3 id="sec-6.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">6.2 New BLS12 parameter for level 128</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Most of the results of [DMHR15] can be used for BLS curves because the extension degree is also 12. Again, we performed an exhaustive search on the parameter u having increasing Hamming weight. We did not find any value of weight 2 but we found two having Hamming weight 3,  <span class="math">-2^{77}+2^{50}+2^{33}</span>  and  <span class="math">-2^{77}-2^{59}+2^{9}</span> . In both cases  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}</span>  can be built via  <span class="math">Y^6-(1+\\mathbf{i})</span>  over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}=\\mathbb{F}_p[\\mathbf{i}]</span> , which provides the best possible  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}</span>  arithmetic. We recommend to use the first one because if the second one is used, the cyclotomic polynomial  <span class="math">\\Phi_7</span>  is irreducible and can be used for h, which improves the SexNFS attack. Then, for  <span class="math">u=-2^{77}+2^{50}+2^{33}</span> , the elliptic curve E (resp. its twist E') is defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  (resp.  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}</span> ) by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$E: y^2 = x^3 + 4, \\qquad E&#x27;: y^2 = x^3 + 4(1 + \\mathbf{i})</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">E is of course twist-secure (thanks to a 273 prime factor).</p>

      <h3 id="sec-6.3" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">6.3 New KSS16 parameter for level 128</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this case, the parameter u should have at least 34 bits to ensure the 128-bits security level on the elliptic curve side. Unfortunately, an exhaustive search does not provide any suitable value of the parameter having Hamming weight less than or equal to 5. The sparser parameter we found is  <span class="math">-2^{34} + 2^{27} - 2^{23} + 2^{20} - 2^{11} + 1</span> . In this case, the extension</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">field is defined by  <span class="math">X^{16}-2</span>  which provides the best possible  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{16}}</span>  arithmetic. The elliptic curve E (resp. its twist E') is defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  (resp.  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span> ) by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$E: y^2 = x^3 + x, \\qquad E&#x27;: y^2 = x^3 + 2^{\\frac{1}{4}}x</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">And again, E is twist-secure (thanks to a 318-bits prime factor). However we found a suitable 35-bits parameter having Hamming weight 5. Such a parameter will of course involve an additional doubling/squaring step in the exponentiation algorithms but it will also involve one addition/multiplication step less. The impact on the Miller loop is negligible, but in the final exponentiation this means that a  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{16}}</span>  multiplication is replaced by a cyclotomic squaring and this happens 9 times since 9 exponentiations by u are performed (see Section 8 for details). Since a cyclotomic squaring is more than twice faster than a  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{16}}</span>  multiplication, it is better to use the 35-bits parameter as long as  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  arithmetic is not impacted. For example, p has 330 bits for the 34-bits value of u and 340 for the 35-bits value. Hence, if a 32-bits device is used, both values of p require 11 words so the  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  arithmetic is not impacted. On the contrary, if a 16-bits device is used, choosing the 35-bits value of u implies that p requires 22 words instead of 21. Then the 34-bits value may be preferred in this case. This parameter is  <span class="math">u=2^{35}-2^{32}-2^{18}+2^8+1</span> ,  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{16}}</span>  is also defined by  <span class="math">X^{16}-2</span>  and the elliptic curve E (resp. its twist E') is defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  (resp.  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^4}</span> ) by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$E: y^2 = x^3 + x,</span>$
<span class="math">E&#x27;: y^2 = x^3 + 2^{-\\frac{1}{4}}x</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">E is of course twist-secure (thanks to a 281-bits prime factor).</p>

      <h3 id="sec-6.4" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">6.4 New KSS18 parameter for level 128</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Again, the limiting factor for the security level is the elliptic curve size so that u should have at least 44 bits. Our exhaustive search provides no values having weight 2 or 3 and only one having weight 4. It is  <span class="math">u=2^{44}+2^{22}-2^9+2</span> . In this case,  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{18}}</span>  cannot be defined by  <span class="math">X^{18}-2</span>  but by  <span class="math">X^{18}-3</span> . The elliptic curves are defined by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$E: y^2 = x^3 + 3,</span>$
<span class="math">E&#x27;: y^2 = x^3 + 3.3^{\\frac{1}{3}}</span>  (or  <span class="math">3.3^{-\\frac{1}{3}}</span> ).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The curve E is twist-secure (thanks to a 333-bits prime factor).</p>

      <h3 id="sec-6.5" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">6.5 Discussion on subgroup-secure curves for level 128</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">All the curves provided are not protected against the so-called subgroup attacks. These attacks use the fact that the three groups involved in the pairing may have small cofactors [LL97]. They can be prevented by choosing resistant parameters. However they do not occur for all protocols. They can also be prevented by the use of some (potentially expensive) subgroup membership tests. Then subgroup-secure parameters are not always used in the literature and in real-life implementations. That is the reason why we provided non subgroup-secure parameters in the general case (better efficiency) and subgroup-secure ones in this higher security section (that should be preferred in some situations).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The definition of subgroup security for pairing is given in [BCM+15] and implies that one should be able to find factors of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1</span> ,  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_3</span> . This can be done using the ECM method but it is very costly so one cannot perform an exhaustive search checking subgroup security at each step. As explained in [BCM+15], the most reasonable way to find a subgroup-secure curve for pairing applications is to find a parameter u such that  <span class="math">\\#\\mathbb{G}_2/r</span>  and  <span class="math">\\#\\mathbb{G}_3/r</span>  are primes. This is of course much easier to check but on the other hand there are much fewer candidates.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">According Section 8, we are only interested in BLS12 and KSS16 curves in the case of security level 128. We then made an exhaustive search of increasing Hamming weight values of u satisfying this condition. For BLS12 curves, we find some parameters in weight 7. We give only one here but the other ones are not so difficult to find:  <span class="math">u=-2^{77}-2^{71}-2^{64}+2^{37}+2^{35}+2^{22}-2^5</span> . In this cases  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}</span>  can be built via  <span class="math">Y^6-(1+\\mathbf{i})</span>  over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}=\\mathbb{F}_p[\\mathbf{i}]</span>  which provides the best possible  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{12}}</span>  arithmetic. The elliptic curve E (resp. its twist E') is defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  (resp.  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}</span> ) by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$E: y^2 = x^3 - 2,</span>$
<span class="math">E&#x27;: y^2 = x^3 - 2/(1 + i)</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">E is of course twist-secure (thanks to a 433 prime factor).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The case of KSS16 curves is more complicated. We first remark that  <span class="math">\\#\\mathbb{G}_2/r</span>  and  <span class="math">\\#\\mathbb{G}_3/r</span>  are always even and often divisible by 17 [GF16] so we have interest to relax the condition. Unfortunately it was not sufficient to find a parameter of Hamming weight less than or equal to 10. This is due to the fact that  <span class="math">\\log_2(u) = 34</span>  implies that there are not enough possibilities for u to have a reasonable probability that all the numbers involved  <span class="math">(p, r, \\#\\mathbb{G}_2/2r, \\#\\mathbb{G}_3/2r)</span>  are primes together (up to some  <span class="math">17^n</span>  factor). As a consequence, it is probably more interesting to choose the previous subgroup-secure BLS curve or the non subgroup-secure KSS16 curve given in Section 7.1.3 together with the necessary subgroup membership tests (depending on the protocol).</p>

      <h3 id="sec-6.6" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">6.6 New parameters for level 192</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the case of higher levels of security we prefer to be more cautious. Instead of a comparison of the best curves we simply give our own proposals. In terms of security we are once again cautious, our curves having more than 192 bits of security. This is due to the nature of our approach (the targeted extension field size is first determined in the worst case). We give only a KSS18 and a BLS24 curve since there is no doubt that BN, BLS12 and KSS16 will be less efficient.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>6.6.1</strong> New KSS18 parameter for level 192 We saw in Table 9 that the parameter u should be chosen such that  <span class="math">\\log_2(u) \\geq 85</span> . As in the 128-bits case, we perform an exhaustive search of low Hamming weight values for u. The best value we found is  <span class="math">u = -2^{85} - 2^{31} - 2^{26} + 2^6</span> . In this case,  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{18}}</span>  can be defined by  <span class="math">X^{18} - 2</span> . The elliptic curves are defined by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$E: y^2 = x^3 + 2, \\qquad E&#x27;: y^2 = x^3 + 2.2^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\text{ (or } 2.2^{-\\frac{1}{3}})</span>$</p>

As in the 128-bits case, we perform an exhaustive search of low Hamming weight values for u. The best value we found is  <span class="math">u = -2^{56} - 2^{43} + 2^9 - 2^6</span> . In this case,  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{24}}</span>  can be built via  <span class="math">Y^{12} - (1 + \\mathbf{i})</span>  over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^2} = \\mathbb{F}_p[\\mathbf{i}]</span>  which provides the best possible  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^{24}}</span>  arithmetic.

      <h3 id="sec-6.7" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">6.7 New parameters for lever 256</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As in the case of level 192, the fast pairings correspond to KSS18 and BLS24, thanks to theirs embedding degrees which are higher than that of BN, BLS12 and KSS16.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In order to keep the complexity low we use only values of u which can be written as a small number of terms of the form  <span class="math">2^a</span>  for some integers a. A side effect is that  <span class="math">u \\approx 2^a</span>  for some a and therefore  <span class="math">p \\approx u^{18}</span>  and  <span class="math">p \\approx u^{24}</span>  in the cases of KSS18 and respectively BLS24.

      <li>Step 3. The size of the sieving space is  <span class="math">(2A+1)^{12}/2 \\approx 2^{132.21}</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">The goal of this section is to compare the pairing computation cost for the curves given in section 6 at the 128 bits security level. For this, we evaluate the cost of an optimal pairing [Ver09] (because it is by far the most efficient at this security level) computation in each case (BN, BLS12, KSS16 and KSS18). Let us first recall the steps of the computation.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-8.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">8.1 Optimal ate pairing computation</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We do not give here the detailed algorithm to compute pairings but only what is necessary to analyze its complexity. More details can be found for example in [EMJ17].</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li><strong>8.1.1</strong> The Miller loop. Miller explains how to compute  <span class="math">f_{u,Q}</span>  in [Mil04]. The algorithm is based on the computation of [u]Q using the double and add algorithm. At each step of this algorithm, f is updated with the line function involved in the elliptic curve operation. This algorithm has been improved by many authors in particular using the twisted curve to eliminate denominators and replace  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^k}</span>  multiplications by sparse ones. The best known complexity for each step are obtained using projective coordinates [GS10]. They are given below    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>If d=6, the doubling step requires one squaring in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^k}</span> , denoted  <span class="math">S_k</span> , one sparse multiplication in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^k}</span> , denoted  <span class="math">sM_k</span>  (for updating f) together with 2 multiplications in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^e}</span> , denoted  <span class="math">M_e</span> , 7 squarings in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^e}</span>  and 2e multiplications in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> , denoted M (for doubling on the curve and computing the line involved in this doubling). If d=4, the curve side requires one additional  <span class="math">S_e</span> .</li>
    </ul></li>
      <li>If d=6, the mixed addition step requires one  <span class="math">sM_k</span>  for updating f together with  <span class="math">11M_e</span> ,  <span class="math">2S_e</span>  and 2eM (or  <span class="math">9M_e</span> ,  <span class="math">5S_e</span>  and 2eM if d=4).</li>
      <li>Additional lines in the pairing given in Table 2 are nothing but extra addition steps. In term of complexity, the last one is usually less expensive ( <span class="math">4M_e</span>  and 2eM for the curve side) because the resulting point on the curve is useless.</li>
      <li>The computation of points of the form [p]Q is very easy because Q is in the p-eigenspace of the Frobenius map. Then it requires no more than 2 Frobenius mapping in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^k}</span> , denoted  <span class="math">F_k</span> . In practice, it requires even less but there is no interest to get into these kind of details for this comparison work.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>8.1.2</strong> The final exponentiation. It is usually split in 2 parts, an easy one with the exponent  <span class="math">\\frac{p^k-1}{\\phi_k(p)}</span>  (where  <span class="math">\\phi_k</span>  is the k-th cyclotomic polynomial) and a hard one with the exponent  <span class="math">\\frac{\\phi_k(p)}{r}</span> . The easy part is made of an inversion, denoted  <span class="math">I_k</span> , and few multiplications and Frobenius mappings in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^k}</span> . The hard part is much more expensive but Scott et al. [SBC+09] reduce this cost by writing the exponent in base p (because p-th powering is only a Frobenius mapping). As p is polynomially parametrized by p, the result is obtained thanks to p0 degree by considering powers of the pairing [FKR11]. Note also that, thanks to the easy part of the final exponentiation, the squaring operations (which are widely used during the hard part) can be simplified. We can either use cyclotomic squarings [GS10], denoted p1, denoted p2, or compressed squarings [Kar13,AKL+11], denoted p3. Compressed squarings are usually more efficient. However, this method has been developed in the case of degree 6 twists [Kar13,AKL+11]. There is no doubt that it can be adapted to the case of degree 4 twists (and then to KSS16 curves) but we did not find explicit formulas in the literature. Then, for a fairer comparison between the curves, we chose to consider both squaring methods in the following.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-8.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">8.2 Finite field arithmetic</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In order to compare the different candidates, we need a common base. It cannot be the field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  because p has not the same size in all cases. So we have to go to the data-words level. We will only give global estimates so we need to make some assumptions that are close to an average environment. Then, we assume that we work on a 32 bits device because it is a good average between software, FPGA and embedded devices. We will also assume that  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  arithmetic is quadratic (even if the multiplication complexity can be subquadratic, the reduction usually stays quadratic). Finally, for simplicity, we will assume that  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  multiplications and squarings have almost the same cost and we will neglect additions. Of course, these assumptions are very dependent on the device so we do not pretend that our result is valid in every case. Anyway, our goal here is not to get an universal comparison (which is not possible) but to have an idea of which curve has to be chosen to get the best efficiency. For a given precise device or context, such general estimates cannot replace a real implementation for a fair comparison.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Pairing computation makes a large use of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^e}</span>  arithmetic. Let us first recall them in Table 12 for the considered values of e.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 15. Comparative complexities of optimal ate pairing computation</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">the complexity for the BLS12 curve using compressed squaring is very close to the complexity of the KSS16 curve with cyclotomic squarings and a practical implementation should be done to confirm the estimated result obtained here. But KSS16 curves have not been studied as much as the BN curves and, more generally, as curves having a degree 6 twist. Then we are quite confident that optimal pairing on the KSS16 curve given in section <a href="#page-18-0">7.1.3</a> can be improved for example by computing the formulas for compressed squaring in this case.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-misc-1" class="text-2xl font-bold">Conclusion</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It was already known that the BN curves, widely used in the literature for the 128-bits security level, do not ensure this security level because of the SexTNFS algorithm. In a recent paper, Menezes, Sarkar and Singh <a href="#page-26-13">[MSS16]</a> proposed new key sizes but their analysis is not precise enough. In this paper, we carefully estimated the complexity of this algorithm in the context of most common pairing families. We also explained why it is much more realistic than the one given in <a href="#page-26-13">[MSS16]</a> for any real life SexTNFS implementation. As a consequence, we give the updated security level of this curve which is in fact 100 bits. We also use this complexity estimation to determine the sizes of the finite field extensions that has to be used to ensure the 128, 192 and 256-bit security levels, and obtained values which are more than 66% larger than the formerly used ones. According to these recommendations, we generate new pairing parameters especially in the 128,192 and 256-bit security levels that are twist-secure (but also some that are twist and subgroup-secure). Finally, for the curves ensuring 128 bits of security we estimated the complexity of the optimal ate pairing for each proposed curve and concluded that BLS12 and, more surprisingly, KSS16 are the most efficient choices. Therefore we encourage the community to study more precisely these curves and to propose software or hardware implementation to confirm our conclusions. This study which is focused on the most popular families is probably not complete since other families and/or embedding degrees could be more interesting.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">B One cannot change the complexity inside the frame of NFS</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Variants of NFS where p is parametrized (SNFS, STNFS, SexTNFS, Joux-Pierrot) are considered to be the dream situation for an attacker. Fried et al. [FGHT17, Sec 4.1] made a series of arguments very similar to the arguments that we use below.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Fact 1</strong> Let  <span class="math">p^n</span>  be a prime power and let  <span class="math">f, g \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]</span>  two polynomials which have a common factor  <span class="math">\\varphi</span>  modulo p which is irreducible of degree n. A variant of NFS which uses these polynomials and find all relations in a time proportional to or larger than the size of the sieving space (enumeration or sieving) has complexity at least  <span class="math">L[32]^{1+o(1)}</span>  where  <span class="math">L[c] = \\exp(c^{1/3} \\log p^{n/3} \\log \\log(p^n)^{2/3})</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Argument:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>step 1</strong> We start by proving that  <span class="math">p^n</span>  divides the resultant of f and  <span class="math">g:p^n\\mid \\mathrm{Res}(f,g)</span> . Indeed, the resultant is the discriminant of the Sylvester matrix and further the volume of the lattice  <span class="math">L=f\\mathbb{Z}[x]+g\\mathbb{Z}[x]</span>  inside of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}[x]</span> . Since  <span class="math">L&#x27;=p\\mathbb{Z}[x]+\\varphi\\mathbb{Z}[x]</span>  is a lattice which contains L we conclude that the volume of the latter divides the volume of the former:  <span class="math">p^n</span>  divides  <span class="math">\\mathrm{Res}(f,g)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>step 2</strong> Let  <span class="math">d_f</span>  and  <span class="math">d_g</span>  be the degrees of f and g and let E be the sieve parameter ( <span class="math">E = A^{\\eta}</span>  in STNFS and SexTNFS). We have  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Res}(f,g) \\leq d_f \\log_2 \\|g\\| + d_g \\log_2 \\|f\\|</span>  which creates the constraint</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$d_f \\log_2 ||g|| + d_g \\log_2 ||f|| \\ge n \\log_2 p.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We easily compute the size of the norms as  <span class="math">\\log_2 \\|f\\| + \\log_2 \\|g\\| + (d_f + d_g) \\log_2 E</span> . At this point we note that we have to solve an optimization problem for which we set  <span class="math">K := \\log_2(p^n)</span>  and  <span class="math">\\log_2 E</span> , which are constants, and we set the variables  <span class="math">x_1 = d_f \\log_2 E</span> ,  <span class="math">x_2 = d_g \\log_2 E</span> ,  <span class="math">y_1 = \\max(1, \\log_2 \\|g\\|)</span>  et  <span class="math">y_2 = \\max(1, \\log_2 \\|f\\|)</span> . Hence the problem becomes:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\begin{aligned} \\text{subject to } x_1y_1+x_2y_2 &amp;\\geq K\\\\ y_1,y_2 &amp;\\geq 1\\\\ x_1,x_2 &amp;\\geq \\log_2 E\\\\ \\text{minimize } x_1+y_1+x_2+y_2. \\end{aligned} \\tag{4}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">step 3 Put  <span class="math">F(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) = x_1y_1 + x_2y_2</span>  and  <span class="math">G(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) = x_1 + y_1 + x_2 + y_2</span> . The local extrema of G on an set where F is constant are obtained in one of the three situations:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li><span class="math">\\nabla F \\parallel \\nabla G</span></li>
    </ol></li>
      <li><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>One of the variables is on the boundary  <span class="math">(y_1 = 1, y_2 = 1, x_1 = \\log_2 E \\text{ or } x_2 = \\log_2 E)</span> , say  <span class="math">y_1 = 1</span> , and  <span class="math">\\nabla F \\mid_{\\{y_1 = 1\\}} \\parallel \\nabla G \\mid_{\\{y_1 = 1\\}}</span></li>
    </ol></li>
      <li><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Two or more variables are on the boundary.</li>
    </ol></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We check that all extrema of points (i) and (ii) are maxima, so we are left with case (iii) which further divides in four cases:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li><span class="math">y_1 = y_2 = 1</span>  i.e.  <span class="math">\\log_2 ||f|| \\le 1</span>  and  <span class="math">\\log_2 ||g|| \\le 1</span> ;</li>
    </ol></li>
      <li><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li><span class="math">x_1 = x_2 = \\log_2 E</span>  i.e.  <span class="math">d_f = d_g = 1</span> ;</li>
    </ol></li>
      <li><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li><span class="math">y_2 = 1</span>  and  <span class="math">x_1 = \\log_2 E</span>  i.e.  <span class="math">\\log_2 ||f|| \\le 1</span>  and  <span class="math">d_f = 1</span>  or vice-versa.</li>
    </ol></li>
      <li><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li><span class="math">x_1 = \\log_2 E</span>  and  <span class="math">y_1 = 1</span>  or the same for  <span class="math">x_2</span>  and  <span class="math">y_2</span> . This is the NFS case with  <span class="math">\\log_2 ||f|| = d_q = 1</span> .</li>
    </ol></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In case (1), the minimum is  <span class="math">x_1+x_2+y_1+y_2=K+2</span>  while in the case (2) the minimum is  <span class="math">2\\log_2 E+K/\\log_2 E</span> . In case (3) we find that the optimized expression becomes  <span class="math">x_2+(K-x_2\\log_2 E)+1+\\log_2 E</span>  whose minimum is obtained when  <span class="math">y_1=1</span>  and we are again in case (2). Finally, in case (4) we have  <span class="math">x_2y_2=K-1</span>  and we have to minimize  <span class="math">2+x_2+y_2</span> . This happens when  <span class="math">x_2=y_2=\\sqrt{K-1}</span>  and  <span class="math">x_1+y_1+x_2+y_2=2+2\\sqrt{K-1}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We can now compare the local minima and conclude that the global minimum is</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\min G \\mid_{\\{F=K\\}} = 2 + 2\\sqrt{K - 1}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that the minimum is independent on the value of E.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">step 4 It is classical to estimate the cost of NFS as B&rho;( log<sup>2</sup> N log<sup>2</sup> B ) + B<sup>2</sup> where N is the norms product and &rho; is Dickman's function, which is 2 + 2<sup>&radic;</sup> K &minus; 1 &asymp; 2 p log<sup>2</sup> (p <sup>n</sup>). Then the classical analysis of NFS leads to the complexity of SexTNFS: L[32]1+o(1) .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Fried et al <a href="#page-25-9">[FGHT17]</a> noted that a multiple variant of SexTNFS is impossible, so it is safe to say that Figure <a href="#page-2-1">1</a> cannot contain a curve below the one used in this article to approximate the security of parametrized pairings.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Practical improvements will continue to come but they will modify only the o(1) term. A hypothetical algorithm which would beat SexTNFS needs to produce relations faster than by enumerating all elements of a sieving space, as it happened in small characteristic with pinpointing, or it would have to completely abandon the NFS diagram. Such an algorithm would be a great discontinuity, comparable to a possible sub-exponential algorithm for DLP on elliptic curves.</p>

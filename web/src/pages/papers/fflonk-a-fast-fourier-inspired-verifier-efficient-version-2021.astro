      <p class="text-gray-300">We present a variant of the Kate, Zaverucha and Goldberg polynomial commitment scheme [KZG] where $d$ polynomials can be opened at a point that is a $d$&#x27;th power, such that the amount of verifier group operations does not depend on $d$.
Our method works by reducing opening multiple polynomials at a single point $x$, to opening a single polynomial at many points via an \`\`FFT-like identity&#x27;&#x27;.

As an application we present a version of the PlonK zk-SNARK[GWC] with significantly improved verifier performance, at the cost roughly tripling the prover time. Specifically, in addition to the two pairings, the verifier only performs five scalar multiplications, rather than 16 or 18 as in the versions presented in [GWC].</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">1 Introduction</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Polynomial commitment schemes (PCS)<a href="#page-17-0">[KZG10]</a> have become a central ingredient in recent constructions of succinct arguments(SNARKs) <a href="#page-17-2">[MBKM19,</a> <a href="#page-16-0">Gab19,</a> <a href="#page-16-1">CHM</a>+19, <a href="#page-17-1">GWC19,</a> <a href="#page-16-2">BFS19]</a> when one desires a &quot;universal and updatable&quot; setup procedure <a href="#page-17-3">[GKM</a>+]. They &quot;force&quot; a prover to answer verifier queries according to a fixed polynomial of bounded degree.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In blockchains such as Ethereum, the precise cost of verifiying a zk-SNARK is of crucial importance to applications such as &quot;zk-rollups&quot;<a href="#page-16-3">[But]</a>. In these recent constructions this cost mostly reduces to the verification cost of the open procedure of the PCS. In this procedure we verify the correctness of evaluations given to the verifier, of polynomials previously committed by the prover. In this work we give a novel method to reduce verifier cost when opening many commitments in a <a href="#page-17-0">[KZG10]</a>-style PCS.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-1.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1.1 Overiew of method and comparison to previous techniques:</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The original scheme of <a href="#page-17-0">[KZG10]</a> requires two pairings to open a polynomial f at a point x &isin; F. If we wish to open several polynomials f0, . . . , ft&minus;<sup>1</sup> at x - using <a href="#page-17-0">[KZG10]</a> directly would require 2t verifier pairings. The common way to improve on this, used in [MBKM19, CHM<sup>+</sup>19, GWC19], has been to choose a random  <span class="math">\\gamma \\in \\mathbb{F}</span> , and instead only verify the value of  <span class="math">f(x) := \\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \\gamma^i f_i(x)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">What verifier efficiency does this result in? The verifier only does two pairings as when opening a single polynomial. However, she must create the commitment for f out of the commitments of the  <span class="math">\\{f_i\\}</span> , which requires t-1 scalar multiplications to multiply the commitments by the scalars  <span class="math">\\{\\gamma^i\\}_{i\\in\\{0,\\dots,t-1\\}}</span> . Can we get rid of this dependence on t in the verifier performance?</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The work of Boneh, Drake, Fisch and Gabizon [BDFG20] suggests a route: They give an opening protocol for multiple points where the number of verifier group operations only depends on the number of polynomials but not the number of points (there is still a dependency in the number of verifier field operations, but these are 3 orders of magnitude cheaper than a scalar multiplication). Thus, if we could reduce opening many polynomials at a single point to opening a single polynomial at multiple points we could then use [BDFG20] to obtain our desired result.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>An illustration</strong> Suppose for a moment we only have two polynomials  <span class="math">f_0</span> ,  <span class="math">f_1</span>  to open at x. A straightforward attempt to avoid the scalar multiplication would be to only open  <span class="math">f_0 + f_1</span>  at x. Let  <span class="math">a := f_0(x)</span>  and  <span class="math">b := f_1(x)</span> . This would prove that the sum of values  <span class="math">(f_0 + f_1)(x) = c = a + b</span>  is correct. However, it doesn't constrain a, b individually: For any value  <span class="math">a&#x27; \\in \\mathbb{F}</span>  we could choose b' such that a' + b' = c, and the verifier would also accept (a', b'). We thus need a way to generate another linear constraint on (a, b) without resorting to using two polynomials.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The well-known &quot;FFT equation&quot; comes to our aid. In the FFT setting, we represent a polynomial f by two polynomials  <span class="math">f_0</span> ,  <span class="math">f_1</span>  of half the degree derived from its even and odd powers:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$f(X) = f_0(X^2) + X \\cdot f_1(X^2).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Here, we use this equation in the reverse direction - starting from  <span class="math">f_0, f_1</span>  and deriving f. Suppose  <span class="math">x = z^2</span>  is a square. f will allow us to derive the desired second constraint on a, b. Specifically, we open f at  <span class="math">\\{z, -z\\}</span> . We have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$b_0 = f(z) = f_0(x) + zf_1(x) = a + zb</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$b_1 = f(-z) = f_0(x) - zf_1(x) = a - zb</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Thus, these two openings of f have given us the desired two independent constraints on a, b and we can determine them. Using the natural extension to t'th roots of unity gives us the same thing for t polynomials.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-1.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1.2 Our results:</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We compare the performance of our PCS to a more straightforward batched version of the [KZG10] scheme as in [GWC19]. For simplicity, we look at the case where we want to open t polynomials of degree smaller than n at a single point  <span class="math">x \\in \\mathbb{F}</span>  that is a t'th power, for  <span class="math">t \\mid (|\\mathbb{F}| - 1)</span> . The table clearly shows the tradeoff - while the verifier group operations</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">for opening do not depend anymore on t, the prover's do - as opposed to more standard batching where the prover's group exponentations<sup>1</sup> only depend on the maximal degree amongst the polynomials. See Theorem 5.2 for the more detailed efficiency properties in the general case (where each polynomial is opened at an arbitrary subset of points).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 1: Comparison of opening t polynomials of degree smaller than n, at a point  <span class="math">x \\in \\mathbb{F}</span>  of the form  <span class="math">x = z^t</span>  for some  <span class="math">z \\in \\mathbb{F}</span> . In prover/verifier work columns  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_i</span>  means scalar multiplication in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_i</span> ,  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span>  means addition or multiplication in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span> , and  <span class="math">\\mathbf{P}</span>  means pairing.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-misc-1" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">When is it worth it?</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The zk-rollup setting motivates verifier-prover tradeoffs such as in this paper. We typically have &quot;client proofs&quot; computed by weak machines. These proofs are not posted on the blockchain, but usually only recursively verified by another SNARK. Thus, for these it makes sense to optimize prover efficiency at the expense of the verifier. On the other hand, the final proof put on chain is typically computed by a powerful machine, and is expensive to verify - since all network nodes must do so. For such proofs, it could be a good tradeoff to use the scheme of this paper.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;1</sup>Following (perhaps faulty) conventions, we interchangeably use the notions group exponetiation and scalar multiplication.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">2 Preliminaries</h2>

      <h3 id="sec-2.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2.1 Terminology and conventions</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We assume our field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span>  is of prime order. We denote by  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{&lt; d}[X]</span>  the set of univariate polynomials over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span>  of degree smaller than d. In expressions involving both polynomials and constants, we will write f(X) instead of f for to distinguish the two; but in contexts where it is clear f is a polynomial, we will simply write f for brevity.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We assume all algorithms described receive as an implicit parameter the security parameter  <span class="math">\\lambda</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Whenever we use the term &quot;efficient&quot;, we mean an algorithm running in time  <span class="math">\\operatorname{poly}(\\lambda)</span> . Furthermore, we assume an &quot;object generator&quot;  <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}</span>  that is run with input  <span class="math">\\lambda</span>  before all protocols, and returns all fields and groups used. Specifically, in our protocol  <span class="math">\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda) = (\\mathbb{F}, \\mathbb{G}_1, \\mathbb{G}_2, \\mathbb{G}_t, e, g_1, g_2, g_t)</span>  where</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li><span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span>  is a prime field of super-polynomial size  <span class="math">p = \\lambda^{\\omega(1)}</span>  .</li>
      <li><span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1, \\mathbb{G}_2, \\mathbb{G}_t</span>  are all groups of size p, and e is an efficiently computable non-degenerate pairing  <span class="math">e : \\mathbb{G}_1 \\times \\mathbb{G}_2 \\to \\mathbb{G}_t</span> .</li>
      <li><span class="math">g_1, g_2</span>  are uniformly chosen generators such that  <span class="math">e(g_1, g_2) = g_t</span> .</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We usually let the  <span class="math">\\lambda</span>  parameter be implicit, i.e. write  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span>  instead of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}(\\lambda)</span> . We write  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span>  additively. We use the notations  <span class="math">[x]_1 := x \\cdot g_1</span>  and  <span class="math">[x]_2 := x \\cdot g_2</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We often denote by [n] the integers  <span class="math">\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}</span> . We use the acronym e.w.p for &quot;except with probability&quot;; i.e. e.w.p  <span class="math">\\gamma</span>  means with probability at least  <span class="math">1 - \\gamma</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Universal SRS-based public-coin protocols</strong> We describe public-coin (meaning the verifier messages are uniformly chosen) interactive protocols between a prover and verifier; when deriving results for non-interactive protocols, we implicitly assume we can get a proof length equal to the total communication of the prover, using the Fiat-Shamir transform/a random oracle. Using this reduction between interactive and non-interactive protocols, we can refer to the &quot;proof length&quot; of an interactive protocol.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We allow our protocols to have access to a structured reference string (SRS) that can be derived in deterministic  <span class="math">\\operatorname{poly}(\\lambda)</span> -time from an &quot;SRS of monomials&quot; of the form  <span class="math">\\left\\{\\begin{bmatrix}x^i\\end{bmatrix}_1\\right\\}_{a\\leq i\\leq b}, \\left\\{\\begin{bmatrix}x^i\\end{bmatrix}_2\\right\\}_{c\\leq i\\leq d}</span> , for uniform  <span class="math">x\\in\\mathbb{F}</span> , and some integers a,b,c,d with absolute value bounded by  <span class="math">\\operatorname{poly}(\\lambda)</span> . It then follows from Bowe et al. [BGM17] that the required SRS can be derived in a universal and updatable setup[GKM<sup>+</sup>] requiring only one honest participant; in the sense that an adversary controlling all but one of the participants in the setup does not gain more than a  <span class="math">\\operatorname{negl}(\\lambda)</span>  advantage in its probability of producing a proof of any statement.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For notational simplicity, we sometimes use the SRS srs as an implicit parameter in protocols, and do not explicitly write it.</p>

To make the comparision with <a href="#page-16-4">[BDFG20]</a> easier, we momentarily use the notation from that paper - where T denotes the union of opening points for all polynomials, S<sup>i</sup> denotes the opening set for the i'th polynomial , i ranges from one rather than zero; and r<sup>i</sup> denotes the polynomial of degree |S<sup>i</sup> | &minus; 1 that coincides with f<sup>i</sup> on S<sup>i</sup> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">At this point we move on to apply the new commitment scheme to the  <span class="math">\\mathscr{PlonK}</span>  proving system. We need to slightly alter some components from [GWC19] for this purpose. We warn that the following sections are hard to follow without an understanding of [GWC19].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We begin by modifying the definition of polynomial protocols from [GWC19]. The changes are:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>We enable compiling protocols using a PCS where the opening set is limited by requiring the  <span class="math">\\{v_{i,j}\\}</span>  below do not map out of the set.</li>
      <li>We explicitly track the number of rounds of the protocol, as with the PCS of this paper this ends up being a crucial parameter for verifier efficiency.</li>
      <li>We don't assume the verifier only checks <em>one</em> polynomial identity, and this makes the notation a little more cumbersome. The reason we could assume this from a certain point in [GWC19] is that the compilation from ranged protocols always produced one identity. But using that compilation will hurt verifier efficiency here.</li>

A  <span class="math">(d, D, r, T, \\bar{t}, \\mathbf{S})</span> -polynomial protocol over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span>  is an r-round protocol between a prover  <span class="math">P_{\\mathsf{poly}}</span> , a verifier  <span class="math">V_{\\mathsf{poly}}</span>  and ideal party  <span class="math">\\mathcal{F}</span>  that proceeds as follows.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As in <a href="#page-17-1">[GWC19]</a>, we define polynomial protocols for relations in the natural way.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 6.3. At this point in <a href="#page-17-1">[GWC19]</a> we defined a further abstraction of polynomial protocols on ranges and showed a reduction from them to polynomial protocols. We do not do this here, as this reduction from <a href="#page-17-1">[GWC19]</a> adds a round to the protocol, which, as already mentioned above, hurts verifier efficiency which is the focus of this paper.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">7 Polynomial protocol for constraint system satisfiability</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As in Section 6 and 7 of [GWC19], we work with a constraint system  <span class="math">\\mathscr{C} = (\\mathscr{V}, \\mathscr{Q})</span>  where  <span class="math">\\mathscr{Q} = (\\mathbf{q_L}, \\mathbf{q_R}, \\mathbf{q_O}, \\mathbf{q_M}, \\mathbf{q_C}) \\in (\\mathbb{F}^n)^5</span>  are our &quot;Selector vectors&quot;; and  <span class="math">\\mathscr{V}</span>  implicitly describe a permutation on [3n].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We present a slightly modified polynomial protocol for the relation  <span class="math">\\mathscr{R}_{\\mathscr{C}}</span>  described in [GWC19]; which is the set of pairs  <span class="math">(\\mathsf{x},\\omega)</span>  with  <span class="math">\\mathsf{x}\\in\\mathbb{F}^\\ell,\\omega\\in\\mathbb{F}^{m-\\ell}</span>  such that  <span class="math">\\mathsf{x}:=(\\mathsf{x},\\omega)</span>  satisfies  <span class="math">\\mathscr{C}</span> . The difference from [GWC19] is that we do not wish to use their reduction from ranged polynomial protocols to polynomial protocols, as this adds a round of</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">interaction, which ends up adding a verifier scalar multiplication in the compiled protocol against algebraic adversaries. Instead, we need to explicitly describe sending the quotient polynomial involved in each of three identities checked. We assume below n is a power of two such that 24n divides p &minus; 1, and H &sub; F is a multiplicative subgroup of F of order n with generator g. Note that our divisibility assumption implies g is a 24'th power inF.</p>

The polynomials qL, qR, qO, qM, q<sup>C</sup> &isin; F&lt;n[X] (as in <a href="#page-17-1">[GWC19]</a>, we identify the vectors with polynomials obtaining the vector values on H).</p>

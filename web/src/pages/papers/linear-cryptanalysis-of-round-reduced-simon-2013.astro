    <h2 id="sec-3" class="text-2xl font-bold">1 Introduction</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">SIMON is a family of lightweight block ciphers designed by the U.S National Security Agency (NSA) to provide an optimal hardware performance <em>[3]</em>. In order to meet hardware implementation flexibility (efficient implementations across a wide variety of platforms as well as several implementations on a single platform), SIMON was designed to support block sizes of 32, 48, 64, 96 and 128 bits, with up to three key sizes for each block size. SIMON <span class="math">N/K</span> denotes a variant of SIMON that has the plaintext block length of size <span class="math">N</span> and the key size of length <span class="math">K</span>. For example, SIMON 32/64 refers to one variant of SIMON with 32-bit plaintext block and 64-bit key. There are 10 variants of SIMON, forming a family of lightweight block ciphers, which are described in Table 2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Till date, the best cryptanalytic attacks on the round-reduced variants of SIMON were presented by Abed et. al. <em>[1]</em>. These attacks include both differential and linear cryptanalytic results. In the direction of differential cryptanalysis, authors have presented key-recovery attacks on all variants of SIMON with up to 18,19,26,35 and 46 rounds for the block sizes of 32, 48, 64, 96, and 128 bits respectively. They have also presented related-key rectangle and impossible differential attacks against few variants of SIMON, but these attacks do not extend beyond the rounds covered by the differential attacks. In the direction of linear</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">cryptanalysis, Abed et al. presented key-recovery attacks on the variants of SIMON reduced to 11, 14, 16, 20 and 23 rounds for the respective block sizes of 32, 48, 64, 96 and 128 bits respectively. In an independent work a differential attack on SIMON was presented by Alkhazaimi and Lauridsen [2] that works up to 16, 18, 24, 29 and 40 rounds of SIMON for block sizes of 32, 48, 64, 96 and 128-bits respectively. In addition, authors have discussed impossible differential rotational and weak key analysis in their work.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Linear Cryptanalysis is a well-known cryptanalytic technique that has been employed on several block ciphers such as DES, Serpent and Shannon [ [7], [5], [6]]. An important fact about linear cryptanalysis is that it is a known plaintext attack, making it more practical and realistic attack model than an attack based on differential cryptanalysis which requires an attack to choose plaintexts for a successful attack. In this paper we investigate the security of SIMON family against linear cryptanalysis. We present several approaches to produce linear characteristics for SIMON32/64 and present the best known linear characteristic for 11-round SIMON 32/64 with the bias of  <span class="math">2^{-16}</span> . We then extend this characteristic to 13 rounds of the cipher.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We present several approaches to produce an LC for SIMON32/64, as a case study, and present the best known 11-round LC for this cipher with the bias of  <span class="math">2^{-16}</span>  (expendable to 13 rounds of the cipher). In addition, we show a direct connection between linear characteristic (LC) and differential characteristic (DC) on SIMON and use it to present linear characteristics for different variants of SIMON that can be used to attack reduced round versions of these ciphers. We also experimentally verified the theoretical results for SIMON32/64 and the results of implementation are represented in Appendix C. With respect to linear cryptanalysis, our results cover more rounds for any variant of SIMON compared to the previously known results of Abed et al [1]. The summary of the results and the comparison with the results of Abed et. al. [1] are given in Table 1. The comparison shows that our results covers more number of rounds for the same success probability and data complexity is also comparable to previous result.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">!<a href="img-1.jpeg">img-1.jpeg</a> Fig. 2. A round function of SIMON.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">to analyze SIMON family of block ciphers. So far the only result on linear cryptanalysis of SIMON is by Abed et. al [1], where an attack on 11 rounds of SIMON 32/64 is shown with the bias being  <span class="math">2^{-11}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The round function of SIMON can be represented as follows:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\left. \\begin{array}{l} X _ {L} ^ {r} = F \\left(X _ {L} ^ {r - 1}\\right) \\oplus X _ {R} ^ {r - 1} \\oplus K ^ {r} \\\\ X _ {R} ^ {r} = X _ {L} ^ {r - 1} \\end{array} \\right\\} \\tag {2}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">(F(X))_i = (X)_{i-2} \\oplus ((X)_{i-1} \\&amp;amp; (X)_{i-8})</span>  with subtractions being performed modulo  <span class="math">n</span> . In the round function of SIMON, the only non-linear operation is the bitwise AND. Note that, given single bits  <span class="math">A</span>  and  <span class="math">B</span> , the output of  <span class="math">(A \\&amp;amp; B)</span>  is 0 with probability 0.75. Hence, we can extract the following highly biased linear expressions for the  <span class="math">F</span> -function:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\left. \\begin{array}{l} \\text {Approximation 1 :} P r [ (F (X)) _ {i} = (X) _ {i - 2} ] = \\frac {3}{4} \\\\ \\text {Approximation 2 :} P r [ (F (X)) _ {i} = (X) _ {i - 2} \\oplus (X) _ {i - 1} ] = \\frac {3}{4} \\\\ \\text {Approximation 3 :} P r [ (F (X)) _ {i} = (X) _ {i - 2} \\oplus (X) _ {i - 8} ] = \\frac {3}{4} \\\\ \\text {Approximation 4 :} P r [ (F (X)) _ {i} = (X) _ {i - 2} \\oplus ((X) _ {i - 1} \\oplus (X) _ {i - 8}) ] = \\frac {1}{4}. \\end{array} \\right\\} \\tag {3}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Given Equations 2 and 3 we can extract the following linear expression for the first round of the SIMON:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">(P _ {R}) _ {2} \\oplus (K ^ {1}) _ {2} \\oplus (X _ {L} ^ {1}) _ {2} = (P _ {L}) _ {0} \\tag {4}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Equation 4 holds with probability  <span class="math">\\frac{3}{4}</span> . With the help of the above expression, we can extract a 3-round linear expression as follows (see Figure 3):</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\left(X _ {R} ^ {i - 1}\\right) _ {2} \\oplus \\left(K ^ {i}\\right) _ {2} \\oplus \\left(X _ {L} ^ {i - 1}\\right) _ {0} = \\left(X _ {R} ^ {i + 2}\\right) _ {0} \\oplus \\left(K ^ {i + 2}\\right) _ {2} \\oplus \\left(X _ {L} ^ {i + 2}\\right) _ {2}. \\tag {5}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As shown in Figure 4, Equation 5 can be used to produce a 7-round linear expression as follows:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\left( \\begin{array}{l} \\left(X _ {R} ^ {i - 1}\\right) _ {2} \\oplus \\left(K ^ {i}\\right) _ {2} \\oplus \\left(X _ {L} ^ {i - 1}\\right) _ {0} \\\\ \\oplus \\left(X _ {R} ^ {i + 2}\\right) _ {0} \\oplus \\left(K ^ {i + 2}\\right) _ {2} \\oplus \\left(X _ {L} ^ {i + 2}\\right) _ {2} \\end{array} \\right) = \\left( \\begin{array}{l l} \\left(X _ {R} ^ {i + 3}\\right) _ {2} &amp;amp; \\oplus \\left(K ^ {i + 4}\\right) _ {2} \\oplus \\left(X _ {L} ^ {i + 3}\\right) _ {0} \\\\ \\oplus \\left(X _ {R} ^ {i + 6}\\right) _ {0} &amp;amp; \\oplus \\left(K ^ {i + 6}\\right) _ {2} \\oplus \\left(X _ {L} ^ {i + 6}\\right) _ {2}. \\end{array} \\right) \\tag {6}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The above expression can be simplified to the following.</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\left( \\begin{array}{l} \\left(X _ {R} ^ {i - 1}\\right) _ {2} \\oplus \\left(K ^ {i}\\right) _ {2} \\oplus \\left(X _ {L} ^ {i - 1}\\right) _ {0} \\oplus \\\\ \\left(K ^ {i + 2}\\right) _ {2} \\oplus \\left(F \\left(X _ {L} ^ {i + 2}\\right)\\right) _ {0} \\oplus \\left(K ^ {i + 3}\\right) _ {0} \\end{array} \\right) = \\left(\\left(K ^ {i + 4}\\right) _ {2} \\oplus \\left(X _ {R} ^ {i + 6}\\right) _ {0} \\oplus \\left(K ^ {i + 6}\\right) _ {2} \\oplus \\left(X _ {L} ^ {i + 6}\\right) _ {2}\\right) \\tag {7}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we extend our attack by one more round to get some 11-round linear expressions for SIMON 32/64. We present three different methods to get 11-round linear characteristic with bias more than  <span class="math">2^{-17}</span> . Once we have any such 11-round linear characteristic we can add another one round to the beginning and one round to the end of each characteristic to extend the attack up to 13-rounds. The added rounds are related to the plaintext and ciphertext and free of any approximation, because we know the input of  <span class="math">F</span>  functions for these rounds. In this way we have a 13-round linear characteristic for SIMON 32/64.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Differential cryptanalysis [4] is a widely used known chosen plaintext/ciphertext cryptanalytic attack technique. In differential cryptanalysis an attacker tries to exploit a high probable input/output difference propagation through the cipher structure. This differential characteristic can be used to detect the non-random behavior of the cipher or recover a part of the</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">secret key with a certain success probability. Hence, in a differential attack we look for an input pair with difference <span class="math">\\Delta X</span> that propagates to an output pair with difference <span class="math">\\Delta Y</span> with a high probability <span class="math">pr</span> and for certain number of rounds of the cipher. We denote this differential characteristic by <span class="math">\\Delta X\\xrightarrow{pr}\\Delta Y</span>. In the round function of SIMON, the only non-linear operation is the bitwise AND. Given two bits <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span>, the output of <span class="math">(A\\&amp;B)</span> would be “0” with the probability of 0.75. Hence, we can extract the following highly probable differential expressions for the <span class="math">F</span>-function:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">\\[ \\left.\\begin{array}[]{l}\\text{Differential Characteristic 1 : }(\\Delta X)_{i}\\xrightarrow{\\frac{1}{4}}(\\Delta F(X))_{i+2}\\\\ \\text{Differential Characteristic 2 : }(\\Delta X)_{i}\\xrightarrow{\\frac{1}{4}}(\\Delta F(X))_{i+2,i+1}\\\\ \\text{Differential Characteristic 3 : }(\\Delta X)_{i}\\xrightarrow{\\frac{1}{4}}(\\Delta F(X))_{i+2,i+8}\\\\ \\text{Differential Characteristic 4 : }(\\Delta X)_{i}\\xrightarrow{\\frac{1}{4}}(\\Delta F(X))_{i+2,i+1,i+8}\\end{array}\\right\\} \\] (22)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">(\\Delta F(X))_{i+1,i+8}</span> denotes differences in <span class="math">(i+1)</span>-th and <span class="math">(i+8)</span>-th bits for <span class="math">\\Delta F(X)</span> to be 1 and remaining bit positions of <span class="math">\\Delta F(X)</span> are 0, similarly for the other expressions. On the other hand, to produce a linear characteristic we approximate bits from output of <span class="math">F</span> by bits from its input and to produce a differential characteristic we propagate differences in bits of input to the bits of output of <span class="math">F</span>. Hence, it is possible to drive a unique connection between Equations 3 and Equations 22. In other words, each approximation in Equation 3 can be mapped to a differential characteristic in equation 22. Given this observation, for an <span class="math">r</span>-round differential characteristic we can construct an equivalent <span class="math">r</span>-round linear characteristic by employing the related approximation of each specific differential characteristic of <span class="math">F</span>-function which has been used through <span class="math">r</span>-round differential characteristic. For example we consider a 3-round differential characteristic depicted in Figure 6 and use the above rule to generate a 3-round linear characteristic depicted in Figure 7.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Now we investigate the strength of different variants of SIMON against linear attack, given the above observation and the known results on differential cryptanalysis of variants of SIMON from <em>[1]</em>. In Appendix B, Tables 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 the propagation of our linear characteristics for SIMON32/64, SIMON48/96, SIMON64/128, SIMON96/192 and SIMON128/256 are presented respectively (for the detail of each used approximation, see equation 3). In Tables 11 and 12 we used the approach of Abed et. al. <em>[1, Table 7]</em> for producing their differential characteristic as the main core of the presented paths. It is clear from these tables that the propagation of number of required approximations in our characteristics are far better than the pattern presented by Abed et. al. <em>[1]</em>.

    <h2 id="sec-8" class="text-2xl font-bold">5 Conclusion</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper we analyzed the security of SIMON family against linear attack. We presented several characteristics for different variants of SIMON. We have shown that there is a direct connection between LC and DC for SIMON and given a DC for <span class="math">r</span>-rounds of a variant of SIMON it is possible to generate an <span class="math">r</span>-round LC (however the probability of characteristics would not be necessarily the same). The significant of this approach is that any progress on providing a better differential characteristic may be directly used to provide a better linear characteristic. Although the presented results are advanced, compared to the previously known results on the linear cryptanalysis of SIMON, it only covers less than half of the rounds of the cipher.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-10" class="text-2xl font-bold">Appendix 0.A Other linear characteristics for SIMON</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Figure 8 and Figure 9 two distinct 3-round linear characteristic are depicted. The interesting point of these characteristics is that they can be combined to receive a characteristic for</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">extra rounds that do not include any intermediate values. For example, concatenating these figures gives a 6-round characteristic that includes the input, output and several sub-keys bits. However, the probability of such characteristic is expected to be <span class="math">\\frac{1}{2}+2^{-17}</span>. If we extend the number of rounds to nine rounds then the probability of such characteristic is expected to be <span class="math">\\frac{1}{2}+2^{-25}</span>. Although such characteristic can not be used to recover the key but maybe considered as a distinguisher for the reduced cipher. It must be noted, based on the same argument, it is possible to extract similar linear characteristics for any variant of SIMON.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In addition, following an approach used in METHOD 3 of section 3.1, it is possible to use equation 7 to produce a 15-round linear expression as follows (see Figure 10):</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">\\[ \\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}(X_{R}^{i-1})_{2}\\oplus(K^{i})_{2}\\oplus(X_{L}^{i-1})_{0}\\oplus\\\\ (K^{i+2})_{2}\\oplus(F(X_{L}^{i+2}))_{0}\\oplus(K^{i+3})_{0}\\oplus\\\\ (K^{i+4})_{2}\\oplus(X_{R}^{i+6})_{0}\\oplus(K^{i+6})_{2}\\oplus\\\\ (X_{L}^{i+6})_{2}\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}(X_{R}^{i+7})_{2}\\oplus(K^{i+8})_{2}\\oplus(X_{L}^{i+7})_{0}\\oplus\\\\ (K^{i+10})_{2}\\oplus(F(X_{L}^{i+10}))_{0}\\oplus(K^{i+11})_{0}\\oplus\\\\ (K^{i+12})_{2}\\oplus(X_{R}^{i+14})_{0}\\oplus(K^{i+14})_{2}\\oplus\\\\ (X_{L}^{i+14})_{2}\\end{array}\\right) \\] (28)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">which can be simplified as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">\\[ \\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}(X_{R}^{i-1})_{2}\\oplus(K^{i})_{2}\\oplus(X_{L}^{i-1})_{0}\\oplus\\\\ (K^{i+2})_{2}\\oplus(F(X_{L}^{i+2}))_{0}\\oplus(K^{i+3})_{0}\\\\ \\oplus(K^{i+4})_{2}\\oplus(K^{i+6})_{2}\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}[]{c}(F(X_{L}^{i+6}))_{0}\\oplus(K^{i+7})_{0}\\oplus(K^{i+8})_{2}\\oplus\\\\ (K^{i+10})_{2}\\oplus(F(X_{L}^{i+10}))_{0}\\oplus(K^{i+11})_{0}\\\\ \\oplus(K^{i+12})_{2}\\oplus(X_{R}^{i+14})_{0}\\oplus(K^{i+14})_{2}\\\\ \\oplus(X_{L}^{i+14})_{2}\\end{array}\\right) \\] (29)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Equation 29, the only intermediate values are the term <span class="math">(F(X_{L}^{i+2}))_{0},(F(X_{L}^{i+6}))_{0}</span> and <span class="math">(F(X_{L}^{i+10}))_{0}</span>. This approach can be repeated to extend the number of rounds of the linear characteristic.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-11" class="text-2xl font-bold">Appendix 0.B Sequences of approximation used through driving the linear characteristic of each variant of SIMON</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Tables 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 represent the propagation of our linear characteristics for SIMON32/64, SIMON48/96, SIMON64/128, SIMON96/192 and SIMON128/256 are presented respectively. In each table, entries under used App. column denotes approximation used for corresponding active bit of column 2 of the table.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-12" class="text-2xl font-bold">Appendix 0.C Experimental results</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We evaluated the theoretical results presented in equation 23 for 11-round SIMON 32/64 experimentally. Table 13 represents the results. In this table <span class="math">N</span> is the number of known plaintexts, <span class="math">C</span> is the number of palintext and ciphertext pairs that satisfied equation 23, <span class="math">Pr</span> is the probability that equation 23 holds. It shows that, experimental results justify the theory and the bias of the presented path is not less than <span class="math">2^{-16}</span></p>

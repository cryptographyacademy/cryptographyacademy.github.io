    <p class="text-gray-300">SIMON family is one of the recent lightweight block cipher designs introduced by NSA. So far there have been several cryptanalytic results on this cipher by means of differential, linear and impossible differential cryptanalysis. In this paper, we study the security of SIMON32, SIMON48/72 and SIMON48/96 by using integral, zero-correlation linear and impossible differential cryptanalysis. Firstly, we present a novel experimental approach to construct the best known integral distinguishers of SIMON32. The small block size, 32 bits, of SIMON32 enables us to experimentally find a 15-round integral distinguisher, based on which we present a key recovery attack on 21-round SIMON32, while previous best results published in FSE 2014 only achieved 19 rounds. Actually, our approach provides a very efficient way to elaborate good integral distinguishers of block ciphers with small block size. Moreover, by applying the divide-and-conquer technique delicately, we attack 20-round SIMON32, 20-round SIMON48/72 and 21-round SIMON48/96 based on 11 and 12-round zero-correlation linear hulls of SIMON32 and SIMON48 respectively. The results for SIMON32 and SIMON48/96 are better than the known results published in FSE 2014. Finally, we propose impossible differential attacks on 18-round SIMON32, 18-round SIMON48/72 and 19-round SIMON48/96, which significantly improve the previous impossible differential attacks. Our analysis together with the previous results show that SIMON maintains enough security margin even if various approaches of cryptanalysis are considered.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-4" class="text-2xl font-bold">1 Introduction</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In cryptography, lightweight primitives are designed to be efficient for limited resource environments, but they should also ensure that the message is transmitted confidentially. Therefore, the vital motivation in the development of new lightweight cryptographic primitives is to maintain a reasonable trade-off between the security and performance. During recent years, many lightweight ciphers have been designed to meet these needs. Prominent examples are included but it is not limited to these: ICEBERG <em>[2]</em>, mCrypton <em>[3]</em>, HIGHT <em>[4]</em>, PRESENT <em>[5]</em>, KATAN <em>[6]</em>, LED <em>[7]</em>, Piccolo <em>[8]</em>, KLEIN <em>[9]</em>, EPCBC <em>[10]</em>, PRINCE <em>[11]</em> and TWINE <em>[12]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In 2013, NSA also proposed two families of highly-optimized block ciphers, SIMON and SPECK <em>[13]</em>, which are flexible to provide excellent performance in both hardware and software environments. Moreover both families offer large variety of block and key sizes such that the users can easily match the security requirements of their applications without sacrificing the performance. However, there are no cryptanalysis results included in the specification of these algorithms.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-5" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">Related Work and Our Contributions</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Due to their simple but elegant structures, SIMON and SPECK have already become the target of various cryptanalytical efforts immediately after their release. On the one hand, several external cryptanalysis results on SIMON and SPECK were published. In <em>[14, 15]</em>, differential attacks are presented on various state sizes of SIMON and SPECK, while the best linear attacks on SIMON are given in <em>[16]</em>. In <em>[17]</em> Biryukov et al. exploit the threshold</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">search technique <em>[18]</em>, where they showed better differential characteristics and proposed attacks with better results on several versions of SIMON and SPECK. Very recently, there are some differential attack results about SIMON32 and SIMON48 in ePrint <em>[19]</em>. These results need to be further verified although they seem interesting. On the other hand, applying various types of attacks with enough optimization to SIMON is interesting and important since this will help evaluate the security of the cipher in different aspects.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper, we investigate the security of SIMON32, SIMON48/72 and SIMON48/96 by using integral, zero-correlation linear and impossible differential cryptanalysis. We firstly evaluate these SIMON variants by means of integral cryptanalysis. Regarding SIMON32, because the block size is only 32 bits, we can experimentally observe the behaviors of all the plaintexts under a fixed key. Our experiments show that the number of distinguished rounds rapidly increases when the number of active bits becomes close to the block size. On the contrary, exploiting such an integral distinguisher with a large number of active bits for recovering the key is hard in general. To recover the key, the integral attack usually requires several sets of the integral distinguisher by changing the values of inactive bits. When the number of active bits is too many, the number of inactive bits becomes too small, and thus cannot produce many sets of the distinguisher. Indeed, our distinguisher needs 31 active bits, and thus has only one inactive bit. To make the data complexity smaller than the code book, we cannot iterate the analysis even for two sets of the distinguisher. We solve the problem by exploiting the fact that the key schedule consists of simple linear equations, and show that reducing any fraction of subkey space can immediately reduce the main key space by solving the linear equations with Gaussian elimination. This enables us to make the attack valid only with one set of the distinguisher. By combining several cryptanalytic techniques such as the partial-sum <em>[20]</em> and the meet-in-the-middle techniques exploiting the linearity <em>[21]</em>, we present an attack on 21-round SIMON32/64 which improves the results on FSE 2014 by two rounds. In fact, this novel experimental approach provides a very efficient way to elaborate good integral distinguishers of block ciphers with small block size. As for SIMON48, the approach cannot be applied due to the large search space. However, according to the experimental results for SIMON32, we may expect that there exist good integral distinguishers of SIMON48 when the number of active bits is near the block size.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Moreover, we construct 11 and 12-round zero-correlation linear hulls of SIMON32 and SIMON48 respectively by using miss-in-the-middle technique. Then based on these distinguishers, we mount attacks on 20-round SIMON32, 20-round SIMON48/72 and 21-round SIMON48/96 delicately with the help of divide-and-conquer technique. Our results improve the best known cryptanalytic results on SIMON32 and SIMON48/96 published in FSE 2014. Finally, we demonstrate impossible differential attacks on 18-round SIMON32, 18-round SIMON48/72 and 19-round SIMON48/96. Although these results are not better than the ones achieved by using differential, integral and zero-correlation linear cryptanalysis, they are the currently best impossible differential attacks for SIMON32 and SIMON48. Our work together with the previous results show that SIMON maintains enough security margin even if various cryptanalytic approaches are taken into account. Our improvements upon the state-of-the-art cryptanalysis for SIMON are given in Table 1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The key schedule of SIMON processes three different procedures depending on the key size. The first  <span class="math">mn</span>  round keys are directly initialized with the main key, while the remaining key words are generated by three slightly different procedures depending on the key words value  <span class="math">m</span> :</p>

The main key can be derived if any sequence of  <span class="math">m</span>  consecutive subkeys are known. For more detailed specification, we refer to [13].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The integral attack [23, 24] first constructs an integral distinguisher, which is a set of plaintexts such that the states after several rounds have a certain property, e.g. the XOR sum of all states in the set is 0. Then, several rounds are appended to the distinguisher for recovering subkeys. In this section, we investigate the integral properties and give integral attacks on 21-round SIMON32/64.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We experimentally find the integrals of SIMON32. The results are shown in Table 3. Here the active bits are the ones in the input of round 1. An interesting observation is that the number of rounds increases rapidly when the number of active bits becomes close to the block size. Giving a theoretical reasoning for this observation seems hard. In other words, experiment-based approaches are useful especially for a small block size such that all plaintexts can be processed in a practical time.</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>Firstly, we generate  <span class="math">2^{t}</span>  plaintexts ( <span class="math">t \\geq 16</span> ) by setting the right half (16 bits) and ( <span class="math">t - 16</span> ) bits of the left half of the input in round 1 to be active, while keeping the remaining bits as constant.</li>

      <li>(a) Choose the main key randomly. Encrypt  <span class="math">2^{t}</span>  plaintexts  <span class="math">r</span>  rounds and check whether certain bits of the output are balanced (i.e., for each of these bits, the XOR sum of the bit over  <span class="math">2^{t}</span>  output states is 0). If yes, keep this as an integral candidate.</li>

    </ol>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(b) Repeat (a)  <span class="math">2^{13}</span>  times and verify if the integral candidate always holds. If not, discard it.</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>If there is an integral candidate for all the structures with the same pattern (i.e., with the same  <span class="math">t</span>  active bits), we regard this as an  <span class="math">r</span> -round integral distinguisher of SIMON32.</li>

    </ol>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As a result, we obtain a 15-round integral distinguisher (Figure 1) with 31 active bits:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">3.2.1 Overall Strategy. The attacker guesses a part of the last 5-round subkeys  <span class="math">k_{16}, k_{17}, \\ldots, k_{20}</span> . Then he partially decrypts the  <span class="math">2^{31}</span>  ciphertexts up to the state  <span class="math">R_{15} \\oplus k_{15}</span> , and computes their XOR sum at the balanced bits. The 15-round distinguisher in Figure 1 has 3 balanced bits. However, the partial decryption up to all of those 3 bits requires too much subkey guesses. Then we only use 1 balanced bit at bit-position 0. Thus, the subkey space can be reduced by 1 bit per set of  <span class="math">2^{30}</span>  plaintexts. In Figure 2, bit-position 0 of  <span class="math">(R_{15} \\oplus k_{15})</span>  is circled and the related bits to the partial decryption from the ciphertext are shown. 3 bits of  <span class="math">k_{16}</span> , 6 bits of  <span class="math">k_{17}</span> , 10 bits of  <span class="math">k_{18}</span> , 14 bits of  <span class="math">k_{19}</span> , 16 bits of  <span class="math">k_{20}</span> , in total 49 subkey bits are related. Because the block size of SIMON32 is 32 bits, the analysis with  <span class="math">2^{31}</span>  plaintexts can be iterated at most twice, which implies that the 49-bit subkey space can be reduced at most 2 bits. Hence, the correct subkey value cannot be determined only with this procedure.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To detect the correct subkey, we further utilize the key schedule. The knowledge of 4 consecutive subkey values can reveal the main key value. Hence, we aim to recover 64 bits of  <span class="math">k_{17}, \\ldots, k_{20}</span> . Among 64 bits, 46 bits are suggested from the 6-round partial decryption. Moreover, because 5 subkeys from  <span class="math">k_{16}, \\ldots, k_{20}</span>  are linked only with linear equations, 3 bits of  <span class="math">k_{16,\\{8,14,15\\}}</span>  can be converted to 3-bit information for the remaining 18 bits of  <span class="math">k_{17}, \\ldots, k_{20}</span>  by solving linear equations with Gaussian elimination. Thus, for each of 49 subkey bits suggested by the 6-round partial decryption, the attacker can obtain 64 bits of  <span class="math">k_{17}, \\ldots, k_{20}</span>  only by guessing 15-bit information of  <span class="math">k_{17}, \\ldots, k_{20}</span> . In summary, reducing the subkey space for 49 subkey bits immediately reduces the subkey space for  <span class="math">k_{17}, \\ldots, k_{20}</span> , which leads to a faster key recovery attack than the exhaustive search.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">3.2.2 Efficient Subkey Recovery. We explain the strategy for efficiently performing the 6-round partial decryption with 49-bit subkey guess. With a straight-forward method, partial decryption for  <span class="math">2^{31}</span>  ciphertexts with  <span class="math">2^{49}</span>  guesses are performed, which requires  <span class="math">2^{31 + 49} = 2^{80}</span>  computations i.e. more</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The goal of the partial decryption is to find 49 subkey bits satisfying  <span class="math">\\bigoplus (R_{15} \\oplus k_{15})_{\\{0\\}} = 0</span> , which is equivalent to  <span class="math">\\bigoplus ((L_{15,\\{15\\}} \\&amp;amp; L_{15,\\{8\\}}) \\oplus L_{15,\\{14\\}} \\oplus L_{16,\\{0\\}}) = 0</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">Hence, we can compute the left-hand side and right-hand side of Equation (2) independently, and later find the match between two independent computations as the meet-in-the-middle attack. In Figure 2, the computation in round 16 is detailed and the approach is illustrated. The computation of the left-hand side of Equation (2) is shown in Figure 3, in which 42 bits of subkeys are involved. The computation of the right-hand side of Equation (2) is shown in Figure 4, in which 42 bits of subkeys are involved. Compared to the original 6-round partial decryption in Figure 2, the number of related subkey bits are reduced from 49 to 42, which contributes to reduce the attack complexity. Inside computations of the left-hand side and the right-hand side of Equation (2), the complexity is reduced by the partial-sum technique. Namely, every time subkey bits are guessed and state values are updated, we compress the amount of data only by keeping the state values appearing odd times.</p>

The check with two plaintext-ciphertext pairs can be done one by one, that is, the check for the second pair is performed only with the first check is passed with probability  <span class="math">2^{-32}</span> . Hence, the time complexity is  <span class="math">2^{48} \\cdot 2^{15}(1 + 2^{-32}) \\approx 2^{63}</span>  21-round SIMON32 computations.

    <p class="text-gray-300">The zero-correlation attack is one of the recent cryptanalytic method introduced by Bogdanov and Rijmen [26]. The attack is based on linear approximations with zero correlation (i.e. linear approximations with probability exactly  <span class="math">1/2</span> ). We introduce 11 and 12-round zero-correlation linear approximations of SIMON32 and SIMON48, based on which we present key recovery attacks on 20-round SIMON32, 20-round SIMON48/72 and 21-round SIMON48/96 respectively.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">!<a href="img-5.jpeg">img-5.jpeg</a></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">By applying miss-in-the-middle technique, we construct 11-round zero-correlation linear hull for SIMON32 (see Figure 5). More specifically, this distinguisher consists of two parts: forward part (along the encryption direction) and backward part (along the decryption direction). For the forward part, we find that for any 6-round non-zero correlation linear hull with input mask being  <span class="math">(0\\mathbf{x}0001,0\\mathbf{x}0000)</span> , the most significant bit of the left half of its output mask must be 0. As to the backward part, we observe that for any 5-round non-zero correlation linear hull with input mask being  <span class="math">(0\\mathbf{x}0000,0\\mathbf{x}0080)</span> , the most significant bit of the left half of its output mask must be 1. Combining the above two parts, we can deduce that an 11-round linear hull with input and output masks being  <span class="math">(0\\mathbf{x}0001,0\\mathbf{x}0000)</span>  and  <span class="math">(0\\mathbf{x}0000,0\\mathbf{x}0080)</span>  must be a zero-correlation linear hull. Similarly, a 12-round zero-correlation linear hull for SIMON48 can be derived (see Table 4 in Appendix B).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Moreover, due to the simplicity of SIMON's round function, we observe the following rotational property which can be used to generate more zero-correlation linear hulls of SIMON.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Property 2 (Rotational Invariance of zero-correlations). Assume that  <span class="math">(\\Gamma L_i,0)\\nrightarrow (0,\\Gamma R_j)</span>  is a  <span class="math">(j - i)</span> -round zero-correlation linear approximation for SIMON where  <span class="math">\\Gamma L_{i},\\Gamma R_{j}\\in \\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}\\backslash \\{0\\}</span> . Then for any  <span class="math">r</span>  where  <span class="math">0\\leq r\\leq n - 1</span> , one can construct a set of  <span class="math">(j - i)</span> -round zero-correlation linear approximations as  <span class="math">(\\Gamma L_{i}\\ll r,0)\\nrightarrow (0,\\Gamma R_{j}\\ll r)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">E</span>  denote the 20-round SIMON32 from round 0 to round 19. Suppose that the 11-round zero-correlation linear distinguisher given in Figure 5 covers from round 5 to round 15. We now present an attack on  <span class="math">E</span>  based on this distinguisher by adding five rounds before the distinguisher and four rounds after the distinguisher, which is illustrated in Figure 6 and Figure 7.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">4.2.1 Overall Strategy. For each of the  <span class="math">2^{32}</span>  plaintext-ciphertext pairs, the attacker first guesses a part of the last 4-round subkeys  <span class="math">k_{16}, k_{17}, k_{18}, k_{19}</span>  and partially decrypts the ciphertext up to the state  <span class="math">R_{16,\\{7\\}}</span> . Then he guesses a part of the first 5-round subkeys  <span class="math">k_{0}, k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{4}</span>  and partially encrypts the plaintext up to the state  <span class="math">L_{5,\\{0\\}}</span> . Finally, the attacker computes the value of  <span class="math">L_{5,\\{0\\}} \\oplus R_{16,\\{7\\}}</span> . The subkey bits related to the above partial encryption and partial decryption are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. We can see that 14 bits of  <span class="math">k_{0}</span> , 10 bits of  <span class="math">k_{1}</span> , 6 bits of  <span class="math">k_{2}</span> , 3 bits of  <span class="math">k_{3}</span> , one bit of  <span class="math">k_{4}</span> , one bit of  <span class="math">k_{16}</span> , 3 bits of  <span class="math">k_{17}</span> , 6 bits of  <span class="math">k_{18}</span> , 10 bits of  <span class="math">k_{19}</span> , in total 54 subkey bits are related.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For a guessed value of the 54 subkey bits, if the event that  <span class="math">L_{5,\\{0\\}} \\oplus R_{16,\\{7\\}}</span>  is equal to 0 happens  <span class="math">2^{31}</span>  times (i.e., the correlation of the linear equation  <span class="math">L_{5,\\{0\\}} \\oplus R_{16,\\{7\\}} = 0</span>  is exactly 0), then we take this guessed subkey information as a correct subkey candidate. According to [26] and the Wrong-Key Randomization Hypothesis given in [27], for a wrong subkey candidate, the probability that the correlation of  <span class="math">L_{5,\\{0\\}} \\oplus R_{16,\\{7\\}} = 0</span>  is 0 can be estimated as  <span class="math">\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} 2^{\\frac{4 - 32}{2}} \\approx 2^{-15.33}</span> . Thus the 54-bit subkey space can be reduced by a factor of  <span class="math">2^{15.33}</span>  approximately.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In order to recover the master key value (i.e.,  <span class="math">k_{0}, k_{1}, k_{2}, k_{3}</span> ), we further exploit the key schedule. Among 64 bits of the master key, 33 bits are suggested from the above procedure. Moreover,  <span class="math">k_{4}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">k_{16}, k_{17}, k_{18}, k_{19}</span> can be derived from the master key by using linear equations, therefore, one bit of <span class="math">k_{4}</span>, one bit of <span class="math">k_{16}</span>, 3 bits of <span class="math">k_{17}</span>, 6 bits of <span class="math">k_{18}</span> and 10 bits of <span class="math">k_{19}</span> (totally 21 subkey bits) can be converted to 21-bit information for the remaining 31 bits of the master key. More specifically, for each of the 33 master key bits suggested above, the attacker can guess 10-bit information of the master key and then obtain 21 linear equations of 21 variables (i.e., the remaining 21 bits of the master key). By solving these linear equations with Gaussian elimination, the attacker can retrieve the master key value.</p>

By using a straightforward approach, we need to do the partial decryption and partial encryption for <span class="math">2^{32}</span> plaintext-ciphertext pairs with <span class="math">2^{54}</span> subkey guesses. This requires <span class="math">2^{32+54}=2^{86}</span> computations, which is much more than the exhaustive key search. In our attack, we adopt the divide-and-conquer technique delicately to reduce the time complexity. More specifically, checking whether <span class="math">L_{5,\\{0\\}}\\oplus R_{16,\\{7\\}}=0</span> has a zero correlation or not can be done by counting the number of occurrences of the event that $L_{5,\\{0\\}}\\</th>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Similarly, by using the 12-round zero-correlation linear distinguisher in Table 4 in Appendix, we can mount key recovery attacks on 20-round SIMON48/72 and 21-round SIMON48/96. For the former, the data, memory and time complexities are about <span class="math">2^{48}</span> known plaintexts, <span class="math">2^{43}</span> bytes and <span class="math">2^{59.7}</span> 20-round SIMON48/72 encryptions, respectively.

    <h2 id="sec-21" class="text-2xl font-bold">5 Discussion and Conclusion</h2>

    <h4 id="sec-22" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Discussion.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As mentioned before, applying our experiments to SIMON48 is hard due to the large block size especially when the number of active bits is close to the block size. We then did experiments in which the number of active bits is 24 (i.e., half of the state) and 30 (i.e., 5/8 of the state), and found 9 and 10-round distinguishers, respectively. Interestingly, according to the experimental results for SIMON32 in Table 3, we observed that if half of the state (16 bits) are active, 9-round distinguishers can be found, and if 5/8 of the state (20 bits) are active, 10-round distinguishers can be derived. It seems that the ratio between the number of active bits and the block size for SIMON48 matches with SIMON32 well, thus we may find 13-round distinguisher with 7/8 of the state (42 bits) being active and 15-round distinguisher with 47 active bits for SIMON48. It remains an open problem to apply this experimental approach efficiently to block ciphers with larger block size.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It was recently shown by Blondeau et al. <em>[28]</em> that zero-correlation linear and impossible differential attacks are closely related for Feistel ciphers, while our paper demonstrated that for SIMON, the former is much better than the latter in terms of the number of attacked rounds. Actually, our results do not contradict the observations given in <em>[28]</em> due to the following facts:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>Blondeau et al. investigated the relation between impossible differential and zero-correlation linear hull without considering the details of round functions. More specifically, they assumed that the <span class="math">F</span>-function adopted in a Feistel cipher is an invertible function. In this case, only 5-round impossible differentials and 5-round zero-correlation linear hulls can be found for a balanced Feistel cipher. While in our paper, we do take into account the details of the <span class="math">F</span>-function adopted in SIMON when constructing impossible differentials and zero-correlation linear hulls of the cipher.</li>

      <li>They focused on the relation between impossible differential and zero-correlation linear hull (i.e., two kinds of distinguishers), while our results are the key recovery attack results with respect to impossible differential and zero-correlation linear cryptanalysis.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Moreover, in 2012, Bogdanov et al. <em>[29]</em> showed that zero-correlation linear hull could lead to integral distinguisher under certain conditions and vice versa. With this result and the 11-round zero-correlation linear hull given in Section 4.1, we can derive an 11-round integral distinguisher of SIMON32. Nevertheless, this integral distinguisher is not as good as the one presented in Section 3.1. On the other hand, it would be intriguing if our 15-round integral distinguisher of SIMON32 could result in a 15-round zero-correlation linear hull. Unfortunately, our integral distinguisher does</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">not meet the definition of integral distinguisher specified in <em>[29]</em>, thus can not be used to generate a zero-correlation linear hull.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-23" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">Conclusion</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper, we investigated the security of SIMON32 and SIMON48 by using integral, zero-correlation linear and impossible differential cryptanalysis, and obtained some new results on these ciphers. Firstly, we introduced a novel approach to find a 15-round integral distinguisher of SIMON32, with which an efficient attack was mounted on 21-round SIMON32. This approach gives a new way of constructing integral distinguishers for block ciphers with small block size. Secondly, we presented attacks on 20-round SIMON32, 20-round SIMON48/72 and 21-round SIMON48/96 delicately based on 11 and 12-round zero-correlation linear hulls of SIMON32 and SIMON48 respectively. Our attacks improved the previous best results (appeared in FSE 2014) in terms of the number of attacked rounds. Moreover, we proposed improved impossible differential attacks on SIMON32 and SIMON48. It is expected that our results could be beneficial to the security evaluation of SIMON.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The impossible differential attack was independently proposed by Biham et al. [30] and Knudsen [31]. The attack starts with finding an input difference that can never result in a certain output difference, which makes up an impossible differential. After that, an adversary adds several rounds before and/or after the distinguisher, and collects plaintext pairs with certain differences. If there exists a pair that meets the input and output values of the impossible differential under some guessed subkeys, discard these subkeys. Finally, exhaustively search the rest of subkeys to recover the main key.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this Section, we propose 11 and 12-round impossible differentials of SIMON32 and SIMON48, based on which we attack 18-round SIMON32, 18-round SIMON48/72 and 19-round SIMON48/96.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">By applying the miss-in-the-middle approach, we obtain 11-round, 12-round impossible differential characteristics of SIMON32 and SIMON48 respectively (see Table 9 and 10).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Data Collection. Given all the  <span class="math">2^{32}</span>  plaintexts, divide them into  <span class="math">2^{2}</span>  structures, each of which consists of two sets of  <span class="math">2^{29}</span>  plaintexts with the forms  <span class="math">(x_{1}?????1?????x_{2}?, ???????????????)</span>  and</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">(x_{1}?????0?????x_{2}?, ???????????????)</span>  respectively, where  <span class="math">x_{i}^{\\prime}s</span> <span class="math">(1\\leq i\\leq 2)</span>  are fixed bits, and the bits ? take all possible values. Clearly, each structure generates about  <span class="math">2^{58}</span>  plaintext pairs which have differences of the following form  <span class="math">(0?????1?????0?, ?????????????)</span> , thus we can totally get  <span class="math">2^{60}</span>  plaintext pairs with the above difference form. Obtain the corresponding ciphertext pairs for all the plaintext pairs. Then for each ciphertext pair, verify whether the difference has the form  <span class="math">(00?????0?000????, ?000???000000?0)</span> . If not, remove this pair. The expected number of remaining pairs is approximately  <span class="math">2^{60}\\times 2^{-16} = 2^{44}</span> .</p>

      <li>Guess the 9 subkey bits <span class="math">k_{0,\\{3\\sim 5,10\\sim 15\\}}</span>.

      <li>Guess the 13 subkey bits <span class="math">k_{0,6}</span>, <span class="math">k_{1,\\{0,6\\sim 8,14\\sim 15\\}}</span> and <span class="math">k_{2,\\{1,8\\sim 11,15\\}}</span>. For each remaining pair, test whether <span class="math">\\Delta F(L_{3})\\oplus\\Delta R_{3}=0000000000000001</span> holds or not. If not, this pair will be removed. The expected number of remaining pairs is approximately <span class="math">2^{14}\\times 2^{-5}=2^{9}</span>.</li>

      <li>Guess the 7 subkey bits <span class="math">k_{1,\\{4\\sim 5\\}},k_{2,\\{5\\sim 7\\}}</span> and <span class="math">k_{3,\\{7,9\\}}</span>.

After this step, about <span class="math">2^{9}\\times 2^{-2}=2^{7}</span> pairs will be kept.</li>

      <li>Guess the 5 subkey bits <span class="math">k_{17,\\{0,2,7,9,14\\}}</span>. For the remaining <span class="math">2^{7}</span> pairs, test whether <span class="math">\\Delta F(R_{17})\\oplus\\Delta L_{17}=0000000000000000</span> holds or not. The probability that a pair can pass the test is about <span class="math">2^{-6}</span>. If any of the <span class="math">2^{7}</span> pairs passes the test, the guessed subkey bits in this step together with the subkey bits guessed before will be removed. Keep the left subkey candidates in a table.</li>

      <li>Among all possible values of the 48 guessed subkey bits <span class="math">k_{0,\\{0\\sim 15\\}}</span>, <span class="math">k_{1,\\{0\\sim 15\\}}</span>, <span class="math">k_{2,\\{1,5\\sim 11,15\\}}</span>, <span class="math">k_{3,\\{7,9\\}}</span> and <span class="math">k_{17,\\{0,2,7,9,14\\}}</span>, the expected number of the remaining subkeys is approximately <span class="math">2^{48}\\times(1-2^{-6})^{2^{7}}\\approx 2^{45.09}</span>. Note that the correct subkey is definitely included in the remaining subkey set. For each of the <span class="math">2^{45.09}</span> subkeys, guess the 16 subkey bits <span class="math">k_{3,\\{0\\sim 6,8,10\\sim 15\\}}</span> and <span class="math">k_{2,\\{0,2\\}}</span> and obtain five linear equations with five variables <span class="math">k_{2,3}</span>, <span class="math">k_{2,4}</span>, <span class="math">k_{2,12}</span>, <span class="math">k_{2,13}</span> and <span class="math">k_{2,14}</span> in terms of the linear equations given in the <em>precomputation</em> phase. Solve the linear equations by means of Gaussian elimination for <span class="math">k_{2,\\{3\\sim 4,12\\sim 14\\}}</span>, thus all bits of main key can be gained. Finally, verify whether the main key is correct or not by using two plaintext-ciphertext pairs.</li>

    </ol>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Complexity of the Attack. The data complexity of this attack is <span class="math">2^{32}</span> known plaintexts. The memory complexity is primarily owing to storing the remaining subkey candidates in the step 7 of the <em>key recovery</em> phase, thus it can be estimated as <span class="math">2^{45.09}\\times 48/8\\approx 2^{47.67}</span> bytes. Regarding the time complexity of this attack, it is mainly dominated by the steps 7,8 of the <em>key recovery</em> phase and can be derived as follows. In step 7, the time complexity can be estimated as <span class="math">2^{48}\\times 2^{7}\\times 2\\times\\frac{6+5}{16\\times 18}\\approx 2^{51.29}</span> 18-round SIMON32 encryptions. In step 8, solving five linear equations with five variables by using Gaussian elimination needs about <span class="math">\\frac{1}{3}\\times 5^{3}\\approx 42</span> bit-XOR operations, which can be measured by <span class="math">\\frac{42}{16\\times 4\\times 18}\\approx 2^{-4.78}</span> 18-round SIMON32 encryptions, thus the time complexity of this step can be approximated as <span class="math">2^{45.09}\\times 2^{16}\\times 2^{-4.78}+2^{45.09}\\times 2^{16}\\approx 2^{61.14}</span> 18-round SIMON32 encryptions. Therefore, the total time complexity of this attack is about <span class="math">2^{61.14}</span> 18-round SIMON32 encryptions.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-32" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">C.3 Impossible Differential Attack on SIMON48</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Similarly, with the 12-round impossible differential characteristic shown in Table 10, we can mount key recovery attacks on 18-round SIMON48/72 and 19-round SIMON48/96 respectively. For the former, the data, memory and time complexities are about <span class="math">2^{48}</span> known plaintexts, <span class="math">2^{42.12}</span> bytes and <span class="math">2^{61.87}</span> 18-round SIMON48/72 encryptions, respectively. As to the latter, the data, memory and time complexities are about <span class="math">2^{48}</span> known plaintexts, <span class="math">2^{66.68}</span> bytes and <span class="math">2^{85.82}</span> 19-round SIMON48/96 encryptions, respectively.</p>`;

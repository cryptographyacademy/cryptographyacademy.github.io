        We present a new tweakable block cipher family SKINNY, whose
        goal is to compete with NSA recent design SIMON in terms of
        hardware/software performances, while proving in addition much
        stronger security guarantees with regards to differential/linear
        attacks. In particular, unlike SIMON, we are able to provide
        strong bounds for all versions, and not only in the single-key
        model, but also in the related-key or related-tweak model.
        SKINNY has flexible block/key/tweak sizes and can also benefit
        from very efficient threshold implementations for side-channel
        protection. Regarding performances, it outperforms all known
        ciphers for ASIC round-based implementations, while still
        reaching an extremely small area for serial implementations and
        a very good efficiency for software and micro-controllers
        implementations (SKINNY has the smallest total number of
        AND/OR/XOR gates used for encryption process).
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">
        Secondly, we present MANTIS, a dedicated variant of SKINNY for
        low-latency implementations, that constitutes a very efficient
        solution to the problem of designing a tweakable block cipher
        for memory encryption. MANTIS basically reuses well understood,
        previously studied, known components. Yet, by putting those
        components together in a new fashion, we obtain a competitive
        cipher to PRINCE in latency and area, while being enhanced with
        a tweak input.

    <section id="sec-1" class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">1 &mdash; Introduction</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        Due to the increasing importance of pervasive computing,
        lightweight cryptography is currently a very active research
        domain in the symmetric-key cryptography community. In
        particular, we have recently seen the apparition of many
        lightweight block ciphers, hash functions and stream ciphers.
        While the term <em>lightweight</em> is not strictly defined, it
        most often refers to a primitive that allows compact
        implementations, i.e. minimizing the area required by the
        implementation. While the focus on area is certainly valid with
        many applications, most of them require additional performance
        criteria to be taken into account. In particular, the throughput
        of the primitive represents an important dimension for many
        applications. Besides that, power (in particular for passive
        RFID tags) and energy (for battery-driven device) may be major
        aspects.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">
        Investigating the recent proposals in more detail, a major
        distinction is eye-catching and one can roughly split the
        proposals in two classes. The first class of ciphers uses very
        strong, but less efficient components (like the Sbox used in
        PRESENT [8] or LED [20], or the MDS diffusion matrix in LED or
        PICCOLO [39]). The second class of designs uses very efficient,
        but rather weak components (like the very small KATAN [13] or
        SIMON [3] round function).
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">
        From a security viewpoint, the analysis of the members of the
        first class can be conducted much easily and it is usually
        possible to derive strong arguments for their security. However,
        while the second class strategy usually gives very competitive
        performance figures, it is much harder with state-of-the-art
        analysis techniques to obtain security guarantees even with
        regards to basic linear or differential cryptanalysis.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">
        Of special interest, in this context, is the recent publication
        of the SIMON and SPECK family of block ciphers by the NSA [3].
        Those ciphers brought a huge leap in terms of performances.
        However, even though SIMON or SPECK are quite elegant and
        seemingly well-crafted designs, these efficiency improvements
        came at an essential price: since the ciphers have a very light
        round function, their security bounds regarding classical linear
        or differential cryptanalysis are not so impressive, quite
        difficult to obtain or even non-existent. No bound is currently
        known in the related-key model for any version of SIMON.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">
        It is therefore a major challenge for academic research to
        design a cipher that can compete with SIMON&rsquo;s performances
        and additionally provides the essential strong security
        guarantees that SIMON is clearly lacking.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">
        Lightweight Tweakable Block Ciphers and Side-Channel
        Protected Implementations
      </h3>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        Tiny devices are more prone to be deployed into insecure
        environments and thus side-channel protected implementations of
        lightweight encryption primitives is a very important aspect.
        One extra protection against side-channel attacks can be the use
        of leakage resilient designs and notably through an extra tweak
        input of the cipher. Such tweakable block ciphers are rather
        rare, the only such candidate being Joltik-BC [23] or the
        internal cipher from SCREAM [45]. Coming up with a tweakable
        block cipher is indeed not an easy task as one must be extremely
        careful how to include this extra input that can be fully
        controlled by the attacker.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">
        Low-Latency Implementations for Memory Encryption
      </h3>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        One very interesting field in the area of lightweight
        cryptography is memory encryption. With a focus on data
        confidentiality, a tweakable block cipher in ECB mode would be
        the natural, straightforward solution. However, all generic
        methods to construct a tweakable block cipher from a block
        cipher suffer from an increased latency. Therefore, there is a
        clear need for lightweight tweakable block ciphers which do not
        require whitening value derivation, have a latency similar to
        the best non-tweakable block ciphers, and that can also be used
        in modes of operation that do not require memory expansion and
        offer beyond-birthday-bound security.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">
        Our Contributions
      </h3>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        Our contributions are twofold. First, we introduce a new
        lightweight family of block ciphers: SKINNY. Our goal here is
        to provide a competitor to SIMON in terms of hardware/software
        performances, while proving in addition much stronger security
        guarantees with regard to differential/linear attacks. Second,
        we present MANTIS, a dedicated variant of SKINNY that
        constitutes a very efficient solution to the problem of
        designing a tweakable block cipher for memory encryption.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">
        Regarding SKINNY, we have pushed further the recent trend of
        having a SPN cipher with locally non-optimal internal
        components: SKINNY is an SPN cipher that uses a compact Sbox, a
        new very sparse diffusion layer, and a new very light key
        schedule. Yet, by carefully choosing our components and how they
        interact, our construction manages to retain very strong security
        guarantees. For all the SKINNY versions, we are able to prove
        using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) very strong bounds
        with respect to differential/linear attacks, not only in the
        single-key model, but also in the much more involved related-key
        model.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">
        With regard to performance, SKINNY reaches very small area with
        serial ASIC implementations, yet it is actually the very first
        block cipher that leads to better performances than SIMON for
        round-based ASIC implementations. We also exhibit ASIC threshold
        implementations of our SKINNY variants that compare very
        favourably to AES-128 threshold implementations.

        2 &mdash; Specifications of SKINNY
      </h2>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        The lightweight block ciphers of the SKINNY family have 64-bit
        and 128-bit block versions and we denote
        <span class="math">n</span> the block size. In both
        <span class="math">n = 64</span> and
        <span class="math">n = 128</span> versions, the internal state
        is viewed as a
        <span class="math">4 \times 4</span> square array of cells,
        where each cell is a nibble (in the
        <span class="math">n = 64</span> case) or a byte (in the
        <span class="math">n = 128</span> case).
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">
        SKINNY follows the TWEAKEY framework from [22] and thus takes a
        tweakey input instead of a key or a pair key/tweak. The family
        has three main tweakey size versions: for a block size
        <span class="math">n</span>, we propose versions with tweakey
        size <span class="math">t = n</span>,
        <span class="math">t = 2n</span> and
        <span class="math">t = 3n</span>, and we denote
        <span class="math">z = t/n</span> the tweakey size to block
        size ratio.

        3 &mdash; Rationale of SKINNY
      </h2>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        Several design choices of SKINNY have been borrowed from
        existing ciphers, but most of our components are new, optimized
        for our goal: a cipher well suited for most lightweight
        applications. When designing SKINNY, one of our main criteria
        was to only add components which are vital for the security of
        the primitive, removing any unnecessary operation (hence the
        name of our proposal).

        3.1 &mdash; Estimating Area and Performances
      </h3>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        We describe an estimation in Gate Equivalent (GE) of the ASIC
        area cost of several simple bit operations (for UMC 180nm
        1.8&nbsp;V [46]): a NOR/NAND gate costs 1&nbsp;GE, an OR/AND
        gate costs 1.33&nbsp;GE, a XOR/XNOR gate costs 2.67&nbsp;GE,
        and a NOT gate costs 0.67&nbsp;GE. One memory bit can be
        estimated to 6&nbsp;GE (scan flip-flop).
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">
        We distinguish between a <em>serial implementation</em>, a
        <em>round-based implementation</em> and a
        <em>low-latency implementation</em>. In the latter, the entire
        ciphering process is performed in a single clock cycle. For a
        round-based implementation, an entire round is performed in a
        single clock cycle. In a serial implementation, one reduces the
        datapath to the minimum.

        3.2 &mdash; General Design and Components Rationale
      </h3>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        A first and important decision was to choose between a
        Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN), or a Feistel network.
        We started from an SPN construction as it is generally easier to
        provide stronger bounds on the number of active Sboxes. There
        is actually a dual bit-sliced view of SKINNY that resembles
        some generalized Feistel network.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">
        <strong>SubCells.</strong> The choice of the Sbox is a crucial
        decision. For the 4-bit case, we designed a tool that searches
        for the most compact candidate with minimal security guarantees:
        maximal differential transition probability of
        <span class="math">2^&#123;-2&#125;</span> and maximal absolute
        linear bias of
        <span class="math">2^&#123;-2&#125;</span>.
        Our Sbox
        <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;S&#125;_4</span> can be
        implemented with only 12&nbsp;GE. In comparison, the PRESENT
        Sbox requires 27.32&nbsp;GE (or 34.69&nbsp;GE without special
        gates).
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">
        For the 8-bit Sbox
        <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;S&#125;_8</span>, the total
        area cost is 24&nbsp;GE. In comparison, the AES Sbox requires
        198&nbsp;GE.

      <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">
        <strong>ShiftRows and MixColumns.</strong> Competing with
        SIMON&rsquo;s impressive hardware performance required choosing
        an extremely sparse diffusion layer. The binary matrix
        <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;M&#125;</span> has only
        differential or linear branching number of two. However,
        <span class="math">\mathbf&#123;M&#125;</span> is designed such
        that when a branching-two differential transition occurs, the
        next round will likely lead to a much higher branching number.
        We can prove at least 96 active Sboxes for 20 rounds.

        4.3 &mdash; Impossible Differential Attacks
      </h3>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        We searched for impossible differential characteristics with the
        miss-in-the-middle technique. The longest impossible
        differential characteristics reach 11 rounds (16 such
        characteristics in total). Several rounds can be appended before
        and after the 11-round characteristic. When the block size and
        key size are the same, two rounds and three rounds can be
        appended before and after respectively, making a 16-round key
        recovery. Data, time, and memory complexities reach
        <span class="math">2^&#123;88.5&#125;</span> for SKINNY-128
        with 128-bit key and
        <span class="math">2^&#123;41.5&#125;</span> for SKINNY-64

        4.4 &mdash; Integral Attacks
      </h3>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        Integral attacks consider the following four multiset properties:
        <strong>All (A)</strong> &ndash; all values appear equally;
        <strong>Balanced (B)</strong> &ndash; the XOR sum is 0;
        <strong>Constant (C)</strong> &ndash; fixed through the
        multiset;
        <strong>Unknown (U)</strong> &ndash; no particular property.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">
        An active cell in any of the third row yields two cells
        satisfying the A property after seven rounds. The property can
        be extended by 4 rounds backwards by activating 12 cells,
        yielding a 10-round integral distinguisher. One can append 4
        rounds after the distinguisher to make a 14-round key-recovery
        attack.

        4.5 &mdash; Slide Attacks
      </h3>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        In SKINNY, the distinction between rounds is ensured by the
        AddConstants operation, so straightforward slide attacks cannot
        be applied. Using MILP, the lower bounds on active Sboxes for
        slid pairs reach 36 after 11 rounds and 41 after 12 rounds.
        These bounds are not tight. We expect that slide attacks do not
        threaten the security of SKINNY.

        4.6 &mdash; Subspace Cryptanalysis
      </h3>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        Invariant subspace cryptanalysis makes use of affine subspaces
        that are invariant under the round function. For SKINNY, the
        non-trivial key-scheduling already provides a good protection.
        We checked that no invariant subspaces exist for the Sbox.
        Moreover, for the 8-bit Sbox, affine subspaces of dimension
        larger than two that get mapped to different affine subspaces
        can be chained only for a very small number of rounds.

        4.7 &mdash; Algebraic Attacks

        The Sboxes
        <span class="math">\mathcal&#123;S&#125;_4</span> and

        algebraic degree <span class="math">a = 3</span> and
        <span class="math">a = 6</span> respectively. For all SKINNY
        variants, we have
        <span class="math">
          a \cdot 26 \cdot \lfloor r/7 \rfloor \gg n
        </span>. The entire system for a fixed-key SKINNY-64-64
        permutation consists of 10752 quadratic equations in 4096
        variables (compared to 6400 equations in 2560 variables for
        AES), indicating that SKINNY offers a high level of protection.

        6 &mdash; The Low-Latency Tweakable Block Cipher MANTIS
      </h2>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        MANTIS is a tweakable block cipher design optimized for
        low-latency implementations. PRINCE already provides a very
        good starting point. MANTIS basically reuses well understood,
        previously studied, known components. By putting those
        components together in a new fashion, we obtain a cipher
        competitive to PRINCE in latency and area, while being enhanced
        with a tweak.

        <span class="math">\texttt&#123;MANTIS&#125;_r</span> has a
        64-bit block length and works with a 128-bit key and 64-bit
        tweak. The parameter <span class="math">r</span> specifies the
        number of rounds of one half of the cipher.

        6.2 &mdash; Design Rationale
      </h3>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        MANTIS is designed as a reflection cipher such that encryption
        under a key <span class="math">k</span> equals decryption under
        a related key, significantly reducing the implementation
        overhead for decryption. The diffusion layer (from MIDORI)
        provides full diffusion after only three rounds. The MIDORI Sbox
        has significantly smaller latency than the PRINCE Sbox. The
        tweak permutation <span class="math">h</span> was chosen so
        that five rounds (plus one SubCells layer) guarantee at least 16
        active Sboxes in the related-tweak setting.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">
        <strong>Security Claim.</strong> For
        <span class="math">\texttt&#123;MANTIS&#125;_7</span>, any
        adversary with
        <span class="math">2^n</span> chosen plain/ciphertext pairs
        under chosen tweaks (fixed unknown key) needs at least
        <span class="math">2^&#123;126-n&#125;</span> calls to the
        encryption function to recover the secret key. For
        <span class="math">\texttt&#123;MANTIS&#125;_5</span>, no
        related-tweak attack is possible with less than
        <span class="math">2^&#123;30&#125;</span> chosen or
        <span class="math">2^&#123;40&#125;</span> known

        Appendix D &mdash; Computing Active S-Boxes using MILP
        and Diffusion Test
      </h2>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        To evaluate the resistance against differential cryptanalysis,
        we rely on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The goal is
        to minimize the number of active Sboxes in a given number of
        rounds.

        <strong>Constraints for XOR.</strong> We define by
        <span class="math">
          \mathcal&#123;C&#125;_\oplus[i_1, i_2, o, d]
        </span>
        the set of linear constraints:
      </p>

      <div class="math-block">

        \&#123;i_1 + i_2 + o \ge 2d\&#125;

      <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">
        <strong>TK2 and TK3 Models.</strong> The key contribution is
        modeling the extracted property of the TWEAKEY update. For a
        given cell position, cancellation between tweakey states occurs
        at most once within 30 rounds for TK2 and at most twice for
        TK3 (since the LFSR has cycle length 15). This is modeled using
        LANE variables with appropriate inequality constraints.

      <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">
        <strong>Diffusion Test.</strong> SKINNY-64 and SKINNY-128
        achieve full diffusion after 6 rounds, both in forward
        direction and for the inverse.

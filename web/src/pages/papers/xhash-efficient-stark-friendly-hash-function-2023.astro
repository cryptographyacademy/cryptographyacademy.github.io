      <p class="text-gray-300">Zero-knowledge proofs are widely used in real-world applications
for authentication, access control, blockchains, and cryptocurren-
cies, to name a few. A core element in zero-knowledge proof systems
is the underlying hash function, which plays a vital role in the effi-
ciency of the proof system. While the traditional hash functions,
such as SHA3 or BLAKE3 are efficient on CPU architectures, they
perform poorly within zero-knowledge proof systems. This is pri-
marily due to the requirement of these systems for hash functions
that operate efficiently over finite fields of large prime order as well
as binary fields. To address this challenge, a new paradigm called
Arithmetization-Orientation has emerged. These designs are tai-
lored to improve the efficiency of hashing within zero-knowledge
proof systems while providing reliable security guarantees.
In this work, we propose XHash, which is a high-performance
hash function designed for ZK-STARKs and is inspired by the Mar-
vellous design strategy. When using Algebraic Intermediate Repre-
sentation, XHash outperforms Rescue and Poseidon as the most im-
portant ZK-friendly hash functions for STARKs. Moreover, XHash
has a competitive performance on CPU architectures with an av-
erage speed of &asymp; 3&#120583;&#119904; for 2-to-1 hashing. Compared to RPO, which
is the fastest hash function of the Marvellous family, XHash per-
forms &asymp; 2.5 times faster on CPU. From the security perspective,
XHash inherits the security of the Marvellous design strategy, and
we analyze its security against state-of-the-art algebraic attacks.
Additionally, we propose a new type of security argument against
algebraic attacks that relies on a single well-defined and reasonable
conjecture of a novel type. Finally, we specify a standard version of
XHash designed for Polygon Miden VM, with its AIR complexity
being 504, compared to Rescue with an AIR complexity of 672, and
Poseidon with an AIR complexity of 1176.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems are advanced cryptographic protocols used to prove the validity of a statement to a party (a verifier) without revealing any further information. ZK systems are used in a variety of applications such as blockchains and banking systems. A pioneer ZK proof system is ZK-STARK <a href="#page-8-0">[9]</a> which is a scalable proof system widely used in industrial applications such as Polygon</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Miden and Starknet. A core building block in a ZK-STARK is the underlying hash function. The pursuit for efficient ZK-STARKs has motivated the need for Arithmetization Oriented (AO) primitives, i.e., cryptographic primitives with low arithmetic complexity. Examples of such AO designs are <a href="#page-8-1">[1,</a> <a href="#page-8-2">6,</a> <a href="#page-8-3">14,</a> <a href="#page-9-0">16</a><a href="#page-9-1">&ndash;18,</a> <a href="#page-9-2">21,</a> <a href="#page-9-3">22,</a> <a href="#page-9-4">27,</a> <a href="#page-9-5">30,</a> <a href="#page-9-6">31,</a> <a href="#page-9-7">33,</a> <a href="#page-9-8">41]</a>. However, the two main AO hash functions in practical use for ZK proof systems are Rescue <a href="#page-8-4">[2]</a> and Poseidon <a href="#page-9-9">[29]</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The design of Rescue was a major improvement in the domain of AO primitives by introducing non-procedural computations. While Rescue is competitive inside the STARK, its security-first approach leaves room for improvement when executed on more standard platforms such as a CPU or an FPGA. Indeed, subsequent improvements were obtained in follow-up works such as Rescue-Prime <a href="#page-9-10">[40]</a> and more recently, RPO <a href="#page-8-5">[4]</a> where Ashur, Kindi, Meier, Szepieniec, &amp; Threadbare published an optimized variant for the specific case of 2-to-1 compression of elements from a finite field with = 2<sup>64</sup> &minus;2 <sup>32</sup> + 1 for 128- and 160 bits of security. RPO offers the same performance as Rescue-Prime when evaluated inside the STARK but is about 40% faster on a standard CPU. The lion's share of this improvement was achieved by finding a particularly efficient MDS matrix but without changing the overall design or introducing new operations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this work, we take the next step in designing AO primitives. We start by analyzing the remaining bottlenecks in RPO and improve the efficiency by introducing a new operation: exponentiation over an extension field. Arithmetic over an extension field is quite common in the design of traditional symmetric-key algorithms such as AES <a href="#page-9-11">[19]</a>. In the context of AO primitives, this approach was carried over to Vision <a href="#page-8-4">[2]</a> and Chaghri <a href="#page-8-2">[6]</a> as well as the nowdefunct Starkad <a href="#page-9-12">[28]</a>; but it was not yet considered for primitives operating over large prime fields.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this work, we use S-boxes employing extension field arithmetic over large prime fields for the first time to the best of our knowledge. Concretely, we propose two new permutations:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>(1) XHash12: interleaving between Rescue rounds and a new type of round;</li>
      <li>(2) XHash8: a more aggressively optimized variant of XHash12 which does not apply the expensive <sup>1</sup>/ S-box to all elements.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Related work. The state of the art arithmetization-oriented hash functions over F for zero-knowledge applications are Poseidon <a href="#page-9-9">[29]</a>, Anemoi <a href="#page-8-3">[14]</a>, Griffin <a href="#page-9-4">[27]</a>, Rescue <a href="#page-8-4">[2]</a>, and its successors Rescue Prime <a href="#page-9-10">[40]</a> and RPO <a href="#page-8-5">[4]</a>. While most efficient hash functions</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">are defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> , Vision [2] is an efficient hash function over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2</span> . An efficient instance of Vision is Vision Mark-32 [5]. The security of Poseidon is analyzed in [3, 12, 32, 39], and it is shown that the security estimation of partial layers is not correct. However, none of the attacks broke any standard instance of Poseidon. The security of Anemoi and Griffin are analyzed in [7], and it is shown that the initial security argument overestimates the attack complexity, and is thus not as solid as expected. In terms of performance inside the STARKs, while Rescue and Anemoi are competitive, and more efficient than Poseidon, they are still less efficient than XHash.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Summary of Contributions.</strong> Our contributions can be summarized as follows.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li><strong>Design of XHash:</strong> Using operations over fields of different order allows XHash to achieve two goals with one operation. Specifically, operations over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> , and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p^3}</span>  provide density, and high polynomial degree using less complexity, and provide robust security guarantees. XHash performs better over zk-STARKs than all other candidates and has a competitive performance on CPU.</li>
      <li>RPX Standard Specification: XHash design allows the usage of arbitrary constants for specific needs, as long as they are not jeopardizing security [13]. We specify an efficient MDS matrix, round constants, padding, and hashing mode of operation tailored for Polygon Miden VM.</li>
      <li>Robust Security Argument: We have investigated both the padding scheme and the applicability of algebraic attacks to both variants of XHash. For algebraic attacks relying on the computation and exploitation of a Gr&ouml;bner basis, our literature survey suggests a security argument on the complexity of the variable elimination step in addition to that of the computation of the Gr&ouml;bner basis to ensure reliable security. We propose a generalization of the &quot;FreeLunch&quot; [7] approach which, under a reasonable conjecture about the behavior of the degree of polynomial ideals of dimension 0, is sufficient for us to argue that both variants of XHash are safe against such attacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Structure of the Paper.</strong> In section 2, we introduce the necessary notation and required background for following the paper. In section 3, we discuss the design rationale of XHash. In section 4, we describe XHash and its design specification. In section 5, we describe RPX standard specification as a hash function using XHash in Sponge construction. In section 6, we analyze the security of XHash against statistical and algebraic attacks. In section 7, we analyze the performance of XHash on CPU and STARKs. Finally, we conclude the work in section 8.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the rest of this work,  <span class="math">p=2^{64}-2^{32}+1</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  is a finite field of order p and the elements of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  are called &quot;words&quot;. For the Sponge constructions, r denotes the rate (size of the outer part), expressed in words, and c is the capacity (size of the inner part), expressed in words. Vectors and matrices are denoted by capital Latin letters. For example, the vector S of size n is denoted by  <span class="math">S = (S[0], \\ldots, S[n-1])</span>  and the elements of a matrix M with dimensions  <span class="math">n \\times m</span>  are denoted by M[i][j] where  <span class="math">0 \\le i &lt; n, 0 \\le j &lt; m</span> .  <span class="math">\\square</span>  is used to denote addition</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">over the finite field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> . Finally,  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  denotes the number of inverse power maps applied in each round.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Rescue-Prime Optimized (RPO) is a sponge function instantiated with a permutation over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p^{12}</span> . The permutation consists of seven rounds and each round can be described in terms of four components:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>an S-box  <span class="math">\\pi_0: x \\mapsto x^7</span> ;</li>
      <li>an S-box  <span class="math">\\pi_1: x \\mapsto x^{\\frac{1}{7}}</span> ;</li>
      <li>an MDS matrix <em>M</em>; and</li>
      <li>constant addition  <span class="math">\\boxplus c</span> .</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With respect to the state vector  <span class="math">S \\in \\mathbb{F}_p^{12}</span>  these components allow to define two types of steps:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>an (F)-step works as follows: first, the S-box  <span class="math">\\pi_0</span>  is applied to each of the state elements to provide non-linearity. Then, the state vector is multiplied with an MDS matrix to spread local properties over the entire state. Finally, a different round constant is added to each element to avoid self-symmetry between different rounds;</li>
      <li>the (B)-step is almost the same, only that  <span class="math">\\pi_1</span>  is applied instead of  <span class="math">\\pi_0</span> . That is, first the S-box  <span class="math">\\pi_1</span>  is applied to each of the state elements to provide non-linearity. Then, the state vector is multiplied with an MDS matrix to spread local properties over the entire state. Finally, a different round constant is added to each element to avoid self-symmetry between different rounds.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With this notation, a typical round for a Rescue-like function is (F)(B). Concretely, RPO can be written as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(F)(B)(F)(B)(F)(B)(F)(B)(F)(B)(F)(B)(F)(B),</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">except that the last M and constants injection are moved to the beginning for reasons explained in [2, Sec. 4.3].</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">3 DESIGN RATIONALE</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">So far, three main components have been used in Marvellous designs: S-boxes, linear layers, and injections of round constants. Together, S-boxes, MDS multiplications, and constant injections result in a dense polynomial representation of a high degree. Building on Rescue's S-boxes, the designers of RPO fixed the MDS matrix to one that can be efficiently computed over  <span class="math">p=2^{64}-2^{32}+1</span> . A natural question then arises&mdash;whether the efficiency can be improved any further without sacrificing security. Noting that the costs of  <span class="math">\\pi_0</span>  and constant injection are almost negligible and that M has been aggressively optimized, the remaining bottleneck has been observed to be the  <span class="math">\\pi_1</span>  S-box. On a CPU, each call to  <span class="math">\\pi_1</span>  requires about 70 multiplications, there are 12 calls in each (B)-step, and seven (B) steps; totaling in  <span class="math">70 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 7 = 5880</span>  multiplications. This is by far the largest cost driver in the entire permutation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Before attempting to reduce this cost, one must determine what purpose the (B)-step serves. Citing [2], the two S-boxes  <span class="math">(\\pi_0, \\pi_1)</span>  are motivated as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The difference between  <span class="math">\\pi_0</span>  and  <span class="math">\\pi_1</span>  is in their degree. They should be chosen such that  <span class="math">\\pi_0</span>  has a high degree when evaluated forward (i.e., in the direction of the encryption) and a low degree when evaluated backward (i.e., in the direction of the decryption). The other S-box,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">namely  <span class="math">\\pi_1</span> , is chosen with the opposite goal (i.e., to have a low degree in the forward direction and a high degree in the backward direction). This choice serves to achieve three objectives: (i) no matter which direction an adversary is trying to attack, the degree is guaranteed to be high; (ii) it results in the same cost for the encryption and decryption functions, and (iii) owing to non-procedural computation, the low-degree representation of each S-box can be evaluated efficiently.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We remind the reader that the stated goal of [2] was to design a general-purpose primitive, usable not only for hashing, not only in STARKs, and to work with any sufficiently large prime field. In the context of Polygon Miden, Goal (ii) is irrelevant since we expect honest users only to compute the primitive &quot;forward&quot;, never requiring efficient &quot;backward&quot; evaluation. Hence, we can abandon Goal (ii) altogether.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For similar reasons, goal (i) can also be relaxed. Avoiding attacks still requires that the degree in either direction be high&mdash;but it no longer needs to be the same in both directions. First, observe that the high degree in the &quot;backward&quot; direction is ensured by the (F)-rounds, which we are not looking to optimize. Therefore, the degree remains sufficiently high and the security argument does not need to be re-evaluated.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We now conjecture the possibility that the (B)-step may offer &quot;too much security&quot; for our purposes. Concretely, [2] observes that the (B)-step achieves maximal degree already after two rounds. Given that the minimal number of rounds is set to ten in Rescue, eight in Rescue-Prime, and seven in RPO, positing a (B')-step that can achieve, hypothetically speaking, a maximal degree in four rounds; the overall performance can be improved without affecting security. Getting ahead of ourselves, this is exactly what we will be doing. To reduce the cost of achieving a compact polynomial description, we propose to use power maps over an extension field. Exponentiation in an extension field simultaneously provides diffusion by mixing the base field elements as well as confusion by doing so in a non-linear way.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Revisiting the design rationale for general Marvellous designs we see that in the context of a hash function operating over  <span class="math">F_p^{12}</span>  with p prime, the interpolation attack would be the main concern in case the polynomial degree is not sufficiently high. Considering in detail the argument against the interpolation attack we see that resistance is achieved when the univariate polynomial describing the cipher is:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>(1) dense; and</li>
      <li>(2) of maximal degree.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Intuitively, the composition of an MDS matrix (which ensures optimal diffusion) with a power map ensures density due to the Multinomial Theorem.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We are left to ensure a maximal degree. Considering that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$x^{\\frac{1}{7}} = x^{(2p-1)/7} = x^{10540996611094048183}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">achieves an almost maximal degree already in a single call to  <span class="math">\\pi_1</span>  we can informally argue that this is an &quot;overkill&quot; and that an S-box resulting in a lower degree per step may still be sufficient to resist the interpolation attack as long as it reaches a maximal degree within a reasonable number of rounds. Thus, we are looking for a power map  <span class="math">\\beta</span>  such that  <span class="math">7 &lt; \\beta &lt; \\frac{p-1}{7}</span> . However, by definition,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">such an S-box will be inefficient to compute inside the STARK both directly and folded.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Seeing that a better power map is not readily available, we can instead apply the same power map, but to fewer elements. However, with this approach, only the elements to which the power map was applied are &quot;protected&quot;. If this approach is taken, the partial S-box layer must be complemented with another operation that would mix high-degree elements with the rest non-linearly. If done right, this would ensure that all polynomials are both dense and of high degree.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">4 SPECIFICATION OF XHASH</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We complement the S-boxes  <span class="math">(\\pi_0, \\pi_1)</span>  described in Section 2.2 with a third type of S-box:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&bull;  <span class="math">\\pi_2</span>  is similar to  <span class="math">\\pi_0</span>  in that it takes a field element and raises it to the 7th power. However this time, the element is in  <span class="math">F_{p^3}</span>  rather than  <span class="math">F_p</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using the new S-box  <span class="math">\\pi_2</span> , we define XHash8 and XHash12. XHash12 uses a full layer of  <span class="math">\\pi_1</span>  S-boxes applied to all elements of the state. XHash8 further improves efficiency using a partial layer of  <span class="math">\\pi_1</span>  S-boxes applied to 8 out of 12 elements in the state.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">XHash12 employs a full layer of  <span class="math">\\pi_1</span>  S-boxes, and works as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A hash function offering 128-bit security is obtained by using either of these permutations in a sponge construction with the elements  <span class="math">(s_0, s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, s_5, s_6, s_7)</span>  as the outer part, and  <span class="math">(s_8, s_9, s_{10}, s_{11})</span>  as the inner part. The round constants are randomly selected and the MDS is the same as the one used in RPO. Domain separation is handled in the same way as in RPO by designating certain values of an inner part element to encode the domain.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">5 RPX STANDARD SPECIFICATION</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The XHash12 function defined in Section 4.1 has been implemented in optimized form by Polygon Miden. We provide here a canonical specification of the function implemented in [34] which we refer to as RPX.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-5.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5.1 MDS Matrix</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">RPX uses the same MDS matrix found by the RPO project. That is, a circulant matrix whose first row is</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">[7, 23, 8, 26, 13, 10, 9, 7, 6, 22, 21, 8].</p>

      <h3 id="sec-5.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5.2 Round Constants</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To ensure &quot;nothing-up-my-sleeve&quot; round constants we reuse the ones derived for RPO. Recall that the RPO constants were derived by employing the following procedure:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Start from the string RPO(%i,%i,%i,%i);</li>
      <li>Populate the wildcards &quot;%i&quot; with the ASCII decimal expansion of the integer parameters  <span class="math">p, m, c, \\lambda</span> , in that order;</li>
      <li>Use SHAKE256 to expand this ASCII string into  <span class="math">9 \\cdot 2 \\cdot N \\cdot m</span>  pseudorandom bytes;</li>
      <li>For every chunk of 9 bytes, compute the matching integer by interpreting the byte array as the integer's base-256 expansion with the least significant digit first;</li>
      <li>Reduce the obtained integer modulo p;</li>
      <li>Collect all such integers. The list of obtained field elements constitutes the list of round constants.</li>
    </ul>

      <h3 id="sec-5.3" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5.3 Primitive</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The permutation used in RPX is different from the one depicted in Figure 1 and the injection of the first set of round constants in even rounds is swapped with the MDS matrix. Since multiplication is distributive with respect to addition, injecting C before applying the MDS, or M(C) after applying it is equivalent in terms of cryptanalytic resistance, and therefore, all security arguments for XHash12 carry over to RPX.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To hash a sequence of field elements in  <span class="math">p = 2^{64} - 2^{32} + 1</span>  we instantiate the sponge construction with the RPX permutation. The state consists of 12 field elements, of which eight are designated as rate, and the remaining four are designated as capacity. Absorbing is done in <em>overwrite mode</em> (i.e., the topmost eight elements of the state are overwritten by new values every time the permutation is invoked) and the squeezing phase outputs eight field elements, of which the first four are returned as digest and the rest are discarded.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-5.5" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5.5 Padding</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For hashing field elements we use the zero-padding scheme; that is, if the length of the last block is smaller than r=8 field elements, a sufficient amount of [0] elements are appended to complete it. We note that this padding rule alone is not sponge compliant. To ensure bijectivity, we partition the input space into eight input domains: all messages whose last block is of length 8 are designated to the 0-domain; all messages whose last block is of length 7 are designated to the 1-domain, etc.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Domain Separation. We enforce domain separation by fixing the topmost inner part element (i.e., the ninth state element) to the domain identifier. Designating one capacity element to encode the domain identifier effectively ensures that two messages whose last blocks differ in length will be processed differently. We provide our proof intuition for this result in the following paragraphs.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof Intuition.</em> We first note that RPX's security (such as indifferentiability, collision resistance, preimage resistance, etc.) remains the same even when the padded zeros are pushed to the start i.e., when the padding type is changed from being a post-padding to a pre-padding. This holds because both paddings are bijective to</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">each other, which means that the prepadded RPX can be seen as RPX with differently ordered a.k.a. permuted input set yet with the same output multiset and output distribution. Therefore, it is sufficient to argue the security of prepadded RPX.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We highlight that prepadded RPX processes messages in the exact same way as prepadded overwrite sponge except that the valid input space for the first permutation call is now larger due to the domain separation. We also note that this increase can at most double the input space for any number of domain seperators. More specifically, the i-domain can only increase the input space by  <span class="math">p^{r-i}</span>  many values as the prepadding for this domain fixes i many elements of a valid input value to zeros and since there are at most r many domains, i.e.,  <span class="math">0 \\le i \\le r-1</span> , we get that the final input space size of the first permutation =  <span class="math">p + p^2 + \\ldots + p^r \\le 2p^r</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One can notice that this change affects the pre-image resistance of prepadded RPX by one bit. More concretely, for q many permutation calls, the pre-image bound of prepadded overwrite Sponge is  <span class="math">p^r(q/p^b)</span>  with  <span class="math">p^r</span>  representing the possible number of valid inputs for the first permutation call. For prepadded RPX, this reduces to  <span class="math">2p^r(q/p^b)</span> . On the other hand, this increased input space does not affect the probability of finding collisions as they happen in the permutation outputs and remains  <span class="math">p^{-c/2}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Indeed RPX's preimage resistance is reduced now from  <span class="math">c \\log_2 p</span> -bit to  <span class="math">c \\log_2 p - 1</span> ; however, noting that  <span class="math">c \\log_2 p = 2 \\cdot \\kappa = 256</span>  this does not form a bottleneck and the security is still compatible with overwrite sponge bounds found in the literature (e.g., [11]); i.e., at least 128-bit security.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold"><strong>6 SECURITY RATIONALE</strong></h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The security of both XHash8 and XHash12 is analyzed against standard attacks, including statistical and algebraic attacks.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-6.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">6.1 Differential cryptanalysis</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We analyze the resistance of XHash8 against differential cryptanalysis by counting active S-boxes. The resistance of XHash8 also ensures the resistance of XHash12 since, for any trail pattern, XHash12 activates the same number or more S-boxes than XHash8. Since the same set of S-boxes is used in both, the probability of the best differential characteristic for XHash8 upper bounds the probability of the best differential characteristic for XHash12.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The analysis follows the standard argument: we find a lower bound on the number of active S-boxes and an upper bound on the probability of the best differential transition in any S-box; the quantity obtained from raising the latter to the power of the former upper bounds the probability of the best differential characteristic.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The aspects of our new function that require special care are:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>(1) The (B') step uses a partial S-box layer;</li>
      <li>(2) The (P3) step mixes base field elements in a non-linear way.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As a result of these particularities, the Two-Round Propagation Theorem originally stated by Daemen and Rijmen in [20, Thm. 9.3.1] for the case of alternating block ciphers cannot be applied directly to XHash8.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To address these observations we provide a step-by-step detailed analysis. First, we observe that in the first step the adversary controls only the outer part of the sponge and therefore they can only introduce a difference in  <span class="math">1 \\le d_{(I)} \\le r = 9</span>  field elements. Consequently, after the application of the MDS matrix  <span class="math">4 \\le d_{(F)} \\le 12</span>  S-boxes are active in the (F)-step. For the (B')-step, the adversary can activate  <span class="math">0 \\le d_{(B&#x27;)} \\le 8</span>  S-boxes, followed by  <span class="math">1 \\le d_{(P3)} \\le 4</span>  S-boxes in the (P3)-step. In total, over a triplet of consecutive (F)(B')(P3) steps, at least nine S-boxes are activated from  <span class="math">(\\pi_0, \\pi_1)</span> , and at least one S-box of type  <span class="math">\\pi_2</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In theorem 6.1 we show that S-boxes of type  <span class="math">\\pi_2</span>  are  <span class="math">(\\gamma-1)</span> -uniform which in our setting means that their differential transition probability is upper bounded by  <span class="math">2^{-186}</span> . Completing the argument, we see that the probability of the best differential transition over a triplet of consecutive (F)(B')(P3) is upper bounded by  <span class="math">2^{9\\cdot(-60)} \\cdot 2^{1\\cdot(-186)} = 2^{-540-186} = 2^{-726}</span> ; which is already enough to resist differential attacks at the 128-bit security level.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Theorem 6.1. Let  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  be a finite field of order  <span class="math">q = p^n</span>  and characteristic p. Let  <span class="math">F(x) = x^{\\gamma}</span>  be a power map defined over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> , then F is differentially  <span class="math">(\\gamma - 1)</span> -uniform.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">PROOF. Given  <span class="math">\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{F}_q</span> ,  <span class="math">\\alpha \\neq 0</span> , the cardinality of the set  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D} = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{F}_q | F(x + \\alpha) - F(x) = \\beta\\}</span>  can be computed as the number of roots for the following polynomial:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(x+\\alpha)^{\\gamma} - x^{\\gamma} = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\gamma-1} {\\gamma \\choose i} \\alpha^{\\gamma-i} x^i, \\tag{1}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">which is a polynomial of degree  <span class="math">\\gamma - 1</span> . It is well known that a polynomial of degree  <span class="math">\\alpha</span>  has at most  <span class="math">\\alpha</span>  roots. We, therefore, obtain the upper bound  <span class="math">|\\mathcal{D}| \\le \\gamma - 1</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Arguing security against algebraic attacks is a complicated task as these are not so well understood at this stage, and the interplay between the &quot;algebraic&quot; part and more classical techniques can sometimes be used to an attacker's advantage in lowering the overall complexity of the attack.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">By &quot;algebraic&quot; attack, we refer to attacks that ultimately culminate with the resolution of a (system of) equation(s), of which the roots need to be found. Univariate techniques can sometimes be applied, but they are not relevant here:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>the degree of the inverse function is close to the maximum possible, meaning that the univariate degree in any linear combination of the inputs will very quickly become unusable; and</li>
      <li>(2) the field size  <span class="math">(p = 2^{64} 2^{32} + 1)</span>  is not that large, meaning that a univariate approach would need to be more efficient than a simple brute-force on one word: a hard task here.</li>
    </ul>

      <h4 id="sec-6.2.1" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">6.2.1 Univariate Algebraic Attacks.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Polynomial Degree.</em> Again, we analyze only the polynomial degree of XHash8 and use it as a lower bound for the polynomial degree of XHash12. Similar to other algorithms from the Marvellous family, the high polynomial degree is obtained by applying a large power map to the elements of the state. However, when we use XHash8,  <span class="math">\\pi_1</span>  is applied only to part of the state. Supposedly, even if we ignore the (P3) round, the next application of M will distribute</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">the high-degree terms to the entire state. However, this is hard to argue formally without reverting to complicated case analysis and furthermore, it is not clear that a linear transformation is enough to spread algebraic properties in a sufficient way.<sup>2</sup> Thus, we do not abstract the (P3)-step but analyze its diffusion properties.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">(x_0, x_1, x_2) \\in F_p^3</span>  and  <span class="math">x_{0,1,2} \\in F_{p^3}</span> . For brevity, we consider only a single squaring operation: Consider the three polynomials describing the base field elements after a single squaring operation:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$x_{0,1,2}^2 = (c_0 x_0^2 + c_1 x_1 \\cdot x_2,</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$x_1 \\cdot (c_3 x_0 + c_4 x_2) + c_5 x_2^2,</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$c_6 x_0 \\cdot x_2 + c_7 x_1^2 + c_8 x_2^2),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">c_i \\in \\mathbb{F}_p</span>  for all  <span class="math">0 \\le i \\le 8</span> . Taking into account that  <span class="math">x_0 = \\pi_1(y_0) = y_0^{1/7}, x_2 = \\pi_1(y_2) = y_2^{1/7}</span>  and setting  <span class="math">x_1 = y_1</span>  we get</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$x_{0,1,2}^2 = (y_0^{2/7} + y_1 \\cdot y_2^{1/7},</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$y_1 \\cdot (y_0^{1/7} + y_2^{1/7}) + y_2^{2/7},</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$y_0^{1/7} \\cdot y_2^{1/7} + y_1^2 + y_2^{2/7}),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and conclude that every possible polynomial description of the initial state is of a high degree even before applying the MDS matrix. While this observation is already enough to argue resistance against interpolation attacks, in Appendix A we work out the complete case for  <span class="math">x^7</span>  in  <span class="math">F_{p^3}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Density. Several works have recently noticed that the solving degree of a polynomial system describing an AO primitive and consisting of  <span class="math">\\pi_0</span>  S-boxes alone is smaller than the degree of regularity. In particular, Sauer observed in [36] that for Rescue-like functions (i.e., functions mixing  <span class="math">\\pi_0</span>  and  <span class="math">\\pi_1</span>  S-boxes), the solving degree grows at the same rate as the Macaulay bound; whereas this is not the case for Hades-like ciphers. This observation was later independently confirmed by Ashur, Kindi, Meier, Szepieniec, &amp; Threadbare in the design of RPO and more recently quantified and leveraged into an attack by Ashur, Buschman, and Mahzoun in [3].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To explain this observation Sauer introduces a new metric, &quot;involvement&quot;, as a proxy for the difficulty of finding a Gr&ouml;bner basis [37]. Two notions of involvement are suggested based on vectors of origin; one based on the normalized average of polynomials from the original system required to describe each element in the Gr&ouml;bner basis and the other on the number of non-zero coefficients in the matrix describing the vectors of origin. Sauer presents heat maps suggesting that the latter is a reasonable, even if noisy, proxy for the difficulty of finding a Gr&ouml;bner basis.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Here, we suggest that the notion of density is sufficient to capture the quality we are interested in when designing a symmetric-key primitive. As an instructive example, consider the polynomial modeling of a single Rescue round consisting of consecutive (F)(B) steps:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">
<span class="math">$\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} M[j,k] S_{2i-1}[k]^{\\alpha}\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} M^{-1}[j,k] (S_{2i+1}[k] - K_{2i+1}[k])\\right)^{\\alpha} + K_{2i}[j] = 0</span>$
(2)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"> <span class="math">&lt;sup&gt;^1\\&lt;/sup&gt;mathrm{We}</span>  note that the S-boxes in the (P3)-step are of different type than those in the (F)-and (B)- steps.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;2</sup>See [32] for the binary case and [3] for the prime case.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that in the second term, the power map  <span class="math">\\alpha</span>  is applied to the entire sum, creating a complicated expression due to the multinomial theorem. For  <span class="math">\\alpha=7</span>  and m=12 as in the case of RPO, each such polynomial consists of  <span class="math">12+\\binom{18}{11}</span>  monomials in 24 variables. Comparably, the modeling of an (F)-round</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} M[j,k] S_{i-1}[k]^{\\alpha}\\right) + K_{2i}[j] - S_i[j] = 0</span>$
(3)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">consists of 12 + 1 = 13 monomials in 12 + 1 = 13 variables. It is straightforward to see that polynomials of type (2) are denser than polynomials of type (3) and since clearly density implies involvement (but not necessarily the other way around) we conjecture density to be the explanation to Sauer's observations<sup>3</sup>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">XHash8 achieves density differently. Considering an even STARK round consisting of one pair of (F)(B') steps. This round gives rise to two types of polynomials:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} M[j,k] S_{i-1}[k]^{\\alpha}\\right) + K_{2i}[j] - S_i^7[j] = 0 \\qquad j \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} M[j,k] S_{i-1}[k]^{\\alpha}\\right) + K_{2i}[j] - S_i[j] = 0 \\qquad j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">neither of which is dense. Density arises from the polynomial modeling of (P3). The polynomial description of (P3) can be found in Appendix A showing that each base element can be modeled as a 3-variate polynomial of degree seven with 31&ndash;34 monomials. Following the MDS, each state element is modeled by a polynomial with  <span class="math">36 \\cdot 4 = 144</span>  monomials in 13 variables.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">6.2.2 The Steps of a Multivariate Algebraic Attacks. The multivariate approach models the primitive as a <em>system</em> of multivariate equations, that needs to be solved. Using a terminology inspired by the one introduced in [7], the four steps performed to solve a multivariate polynomial system are described as follows.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>SysGen:</strong> First, the system of equations needs to be generated. Several heuristics are available to this end, but all of them have to introduce new variables whenever a <em>d</em>-th root is used as it is the compositional inverse of these operations that is of a low degree. This step can further be simplified using techniques from &quot;classical&quot; symmetric cryptanalysis, typically based on the probability one propagation of some affine spaces. This was used to shave off two SPN rounds generically in [8], with the conditions that the S-boxes are monomials over the base field considered,<sup>4</sup> and that the cipher/permutation starts with an S-box layer. The system that is generated in the end is not uniquely defined: different generation strategies will yield different systems. For instance, using affine spaces to simplify it will remove some equations. Similarly, we can prefer to introduce new variables and equations to obtain more but lower degree equations. The existence of an efficient SysGen procedure is implied by arithmetization-orientation, but it is not necessarily the approach used in attacks.<sup>5</sup></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that the algorithms used in the next steps are better understood in the case where the system is expected to have unique (or just a few) solutions. This further adds constraints for the SysGen step, but they are easily handled: the expected number of solutions is easily estimated assuming e.g. that the hash function behaves like a random function, and the input can be constrained for instance by forcing it to be in a vector space of the appropriate dimension.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Gr&ouml;bFind:</strong> Once a system is obtained, it is necessary first to endow it with a structure that will allow us to work with it. This, in particular, allows us to do the polynomial arithmetic we need, e.g. to reduce large degree polynomials modulo lower degree ones. The equations we have obtained define an ideal: since we investigate their common roots, any linear combination will also have the same roots. An ideal of polynomials has a Gr&ouml;bner basis, a particular set of polynomials that essentially allow us to properly define a reduction modulo this ideal. A Gr&ouml;bner basis is defined for a given monomial ordering. Several of these are well-known. In particular, a Gr&ouml;bner basis in <em>lexicographic</em> order can greatly simplify the next steps of the attack. On the other hand, the complexity of finding a Gr&ouml;bner basis is highly dependent on said ordering. In general, to obtain a basis e.g. in grevlex order given any ideal, we need to use either F4 or F5 [24, 26]. Unfortunately, efficient open-source implementations are hard to find. The state-of-the-art approach to compute the complexity is the one described in [2] where the behavior of toy examples is compared to the expected behavior of a regular system and then extrapolated to larger cases. We performed similar experiments and the results are reported in Appendix B.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>VarElim.</strong> Once a Gr&ouml;bner basis is known, we use its structure to extract a univariate polynomial in one of the variables. This extraction step is usually done by reordering the Gr&ouml;bner basis, i.e. by obtaining a Gr&ouml;bner basis for a different monomial order, one that is suitable for this purpose. It is usually the lexicographic one. This change of order can be done using the FGLM [25] algorithm, whose complexity is precisely known as it boils down to linear polynomial arithmetic. It depends on a quantity called the <em>degree of the ideal</em>  <span class="math">(D_I)</span>  and corresponds to the number of roots the system has in the algebraic closure of the field considered. This number is much higher than the number of solutions in the field itself (typically 0, 1 or 2).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">More custom approaches are sometimes possible; for instance, the authors of [7] introduced the combination of MatMul and PolyDet: the idea is to bypass the cost of a full FGLM run by focusing on a single variable that is of particular interest in their case.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>UniSolve.</strong> By design, we expect a solution to exist. Thus, once a univariate equation is extracted, we solve it using well-known techniques to get the first root of the system. We then substitute its value in the other equations and deduce an assignment for all the variables. This works provided that the equations have the correct structure, but this is always the case for the output of FGLM, under some reasonable assumptions that have been found to hold in practice when attacking arithmetization oriented primitives.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">6.2.3 Arguing Security in the Multivariate Case. In order to show that a hash function is safe from multivariate algebraic attacks, we need to find a lower bound on the time complexity of the resolution of a system corresponding to a CICO instance. For XHash, as p is</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;3</sup>This conjecture arises independently in the argument of Freelunch [7] attacks <sup>4</sup>In contrast to what is done in XHash, where monomials are applied over both  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2^3</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;5</sup>In fact, our encoding for XHash12 will be the STARK one, while the one for XHash8 is significantly different.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">small, we need to fix several inputs and several outputs to zero at the same time.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Which complexity should we focus on? The complexity of Sys-Gen could be amortized over several attacks, and is expected to be lower than the other steps. The UniSolve step is also known to be very efficient [8] Worse, the Gr&ouml;bFind step has been found to be literally free for some permutations [7]. This leaves us with the VarElim step. This is not a bad thing: it is the step whose complexity is the best understood. It depends on a quantity known as the <em>ideal degree</em> ( <span class="math">D_I</span> ), which corresponds to the number of solutions of the multivariate system in the algebraic closure of the field considered. For example,  <span class="math">y = x^7</span>  has a unique solution in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> , but 7 in its algebraic closure. The complexity of FGLM is then proportional to  <span class="math">D_I^3</span> , though variants exist with a lower (but still higher than quadratic) complexity in some very specific cases.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Under a reasonable conjecture, we can derive lower bounds on  <span class="math">D_I</span>  that are sufficient to argue the security of both variants of XHash. To describe this conjecture, we first need the following definition.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Definition 6.2 (b-Almost Basal). We call b-almost basal (b-AB) a system of n polynomials  <span class="math">P_i</span>  in variables  <span class="math">(x_0, ..., x_{n-1})</span> , where b &gt; 0 is an integer, when the following properties hold:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Non-degenerate: the ideal spanned by these polynomials is of dimension 0;</li>
      <li>Basal part: there exists a monomial order such that the leading term of  <span class="math">P_i</span> , i &lt; b, is the monomial  <span class="math">x_i^{d_i}</span>  for some integer  <span class="math">d_i &gt; 0</span> .</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Such a system is depicted in Figure 3.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The idea of this notion is to describe a set of multivariate polynomials which is &quot;partially&quot; a Gr&ouml;bner basis. Indeed, it is sufficient for polynomials to form a Gr&ouml;bner basis that the leading term in each  <span class="math">P_i</span>  is of the form  <span class="math">x_i^{d_i}</span> . In a b-AB system, the first b polynomials have this shape. In fact, an n-AB system is a Gr&ouml;bner basis.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">
<span class="math">$b\\text{-AB system} \\begin{cases} x_0^{d_0} - P_0&#x27;(x_0,...,x_{n-1}) \\\\ x_1^{d_1} - P_1&#x27;(x_0,...,x_{n-1}) \\\\ ... \\\\ x_{b-1}^{d_{b-1}} - P_{b-1}&#x27;(x_0,...,x_{n-1}) \\end{cases} \\text{ basal part } \\\\ P_b(x_0,...,x_{n-1}) \\\\ P_{b+1}(x_0,...,x_{n-1}) \\\\ ... \\\\ P_{n-1}(x_0,...,x_{n-1}) \\end{cases}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 3: The structure of an b-AB system, where  <span class="math">P_i(x) = x_i^{d_i} - P&#x27;(x)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using this notion, we are ready to state the following conjecture.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Conjecture 1 (Monotonous Ideal Degree Conjecture (MIDC)). For a b-AB system, the degree  <span class="math">D_I</span>  of the ideal is lower bounded by  <span class="math">D_I \\ge \\prod_{i=0}^{b-1} d_i</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The intuition behind this conjecture is simple: the ideal degree corresponds to the number of solutions the system has in the algebraic closure of the underlying field, and this conjecture postulates that this number does not decrease when we take into account the last equations. That is where the term &quot;monotonous&quot; comes from: we assume that the ideal degree increases or stays constant but does not decrease when we consider more equations. To put it differently, this conjecture posits that the actual Gr&ouml;bner basis of the system contains the basal part and that the last equations (those not in the basal part) do not decrease the ideal degree.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This conjecture is true when b = n: in this case, the system is a Gr&ouml;bner basis, and the ideal degree is known to be  <span class="math">\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} d_i</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">According to our experiments, for a simplified XHash, this conjecture holds. In fact, in our experiments, we do have that  <span class="math">D_I = \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} d_i</span> , even though the last polynomials have identical leading terms. In that case, the last equations participate as if they had different leading terms. Still, we deem it safer at this stage to only take the basal part into account when making a security claim.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Applying our attack strategy against one word in XHash8, i.e. solving a CICO instance with a single [0] in the input and one in the output, we simply obtain a FreeLunch [7] system. It is a particular case of an n-AB system. Under the MIDC, the ideal degree corresponding to an attack on w words is lower bounded by the complexity of attacking a single word. Indeed, when w &gt; 1, the first equations still form a basal part of the polynomial system, and only the last w-1 equations are not basal. As a consequence, we get a bound on  <span class="math">D_I</span>  which corresponds to its value in the w=1 case, namely  <span class="math">D_I \\geq d^{8r}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For XHash8, even ignoring the presence of the first equation with leading term  <span class="math">x_0</span>  among the final equations, we get that  <span class="math">D_I \\ge d^{3\\times8} \\approx 2^{67}</span> . Adding the equation in  <span class="math">x_0</span> , which also satisfies the criteria to be part of the basal part, we get  <span class="math">D_I \\ge d^{3\\times8} \\times d^{3\\times2} \\approx 2^{84}</span> . As a consequence, for GB-based algebraic attacks to be a threat against XHash8, we would need two things:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>(1) that the bound for  <span class="math">D_I</span>  is tight (experiments indicate that it is not), <strong>and</strong></li>
      <li>(2) an FGLM-like algorithm with a complexity strictly subquadratic in  <span class="math">D_I</span> &mdash;in fact, even a complexity proportional to  <span class="math">D_I^{1.5}</span>  would give a complexity around  <span class="math">2^{126}</span>  in this case: barely an attack.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For XHash12, we get a bound of  <span class="math">D_I \\ge d^{3\\times 12} \\approx 2^{101}</span> , which is even higher&mdash;and thus safer. At this stage, we expect neither the bounds to be tight nor such an algorithm to exist. Thus, we claim that XHash8 is safe against GB-based algebraic attacks. The detailed analysis of the attack is described in Appendix C</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">8 CONCLUSION</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This work introduced XHash, an efficient permutation for zero-knowledge applications with robust security. The security of XHash relies on a detailed analysis against different attack vectors, in particular algebraic attacks. For these, we have introduced a new type of security argument with a clear underlying conjecture which allows us to provide a strong argument against even the most recent variants of this attack. From the performance point of view, XHash is more efficient for STARKs than all current candidates and is very competitive on different CPU architectures, making it the most suitable option for the provers in zero-knowledge systems as well as the verifiers.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">C ALGEBRAIC FREELUNCH ATTACK</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We build a security claim against rootfinding attacks against each of the steps described in subsubsection 6.2.2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">SysGen. As we established during the discussion above, heuristics exist to lower the complexity of this step, however, it is also possible to mitigate them using appropriate counter-measures (such as starting with a linear diffusion layer). Furthermore, as this step cannot be avoided, it could make sense to base a security claim on the complexity of this step. However, this complexity is hard to estimate, and (as shown in [7]) tends to be much lower than other steps of the attack. Besides, running for instance a preimage search multiple times for different preimages would lead to essentially identical systems, except for some constants in the very last equations. As a consequence, the cost of this step could be amortized</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">over several attacks. In the end, we claim that relying on this step for a security bound would not lead to meaningful results.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Gr&ouml;bFind.</em> Experimental results often indicated that this step was the longest in the attack against an AOP, which led the authors of several primitives to follow those of Rescue [2], and base their security claims using an estimate of the complexity of F4 or F5 (e.g. Griffin [27], Anemoi [14]).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">While there is no reason to challenge these experimental results, such claims are now unfortunately falling short. Indeed, it turns out that it is possible to find monomial orderings such that the system obtained during the SysGen step is immediately a Gr&ouml;bner basis. To the best of our knowledge, this was first put forward to investigate the AES [15], and then adapted to the cryptanalysis of AOPs by two independent teams investigating different algorithms: the authors of [7] described the &quot;freelunch&quot; approach, which they applied to Anemoi, Arion, XHash8 and in particular Griffin; while Steiner very recently put forward papers presenting such orderings for Poseidon [39] and Rescue [38].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>VarElim.</em> The complexity of FGLM is well known and &quot;stable&quot;: while the complexity of Gr&ouml;bFind can only be upper-bounded (while we would need a lower bound anyway), that of FGLM is tight. Furthermore, even though the technique presented in [7] is more efficient than FGLM, its complexity has a similar structure. Variants of FGLM exist that can be applied e.g. to sparser systems. The applicability of these variants is not so clear, but their complexity also depends on the same quantity: the ideal degree  <span class="math">D_I</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We will thus base our security argument on the complexity of this step.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>UniSolve.</em> The complexity of this step is tightly known and is negligible compared to all the other steps considered here. It cannot serve as the basis for a security claim.</p>

      <h3 id="app-c.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">C.1 Modeling XHash</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In what follows, letters x,y denote variables in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> , and Greek letters denote multivariate polynomials of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> . The inner operations of XHash are denoted with upper case Latin letters.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>General Approach.</em> For both instances of XHash, we use a similar approach. In order to ensure that the system is expected to have a single solution (or at most a few), we need to restrict the input to a vector space of dimension r, r being the rate. The simplest approach consists simply in starting with variables  <span class="math">x_0, ..., x_{r-1}</span>  for the input of the permutation, setting the others to 0.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Then we construct polynomial constraints ensuring that the internal state at the output of the permutation is indeed the image of the initial state after the relevant operations. Passing through low degree operations is easy as we simply need to directly update the polynomials by composing them with said operations. For the (partial) layer of the  <span class="math">7^{th}</span>  root, we proceed differently: we introduce variables  <span class="math">y^i_j</span>  just after each 7-th roots, i being the round index and j the word index.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">First Round. For the first round, we simply need to encode that the inputs of each 7th root are obtained by applying two MDS layers and a layer of small monomials (along with the appropriate round constants). We deduce 12 equations (resp. 8) for XHash12 (resp.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">XHash8) of the following shape:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(y_j^1)^7 = C_1 + L_j \\left( S \\left( L \\left( C_0 + \\vec{x} \\right) \\right) \\right) = \\alpha_j(x) .</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To look for solutions to the CICO problem&mdash;or indeed for preimages, we need to fix the capacity words to 0. To this end, we consider that  <span class="math">\\vec{x} = (x_0, ..., x_{r-1}, 0, ..., 0)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Middle Rounds. We get equations of the following types for the middle rounds of XHash12:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(y_j^{i+1})^7 = C_i + L_j \\left( S \\left( L \\left( C_i + T(y^i) \\right) \\right) \\right) = \\mu_i(y^i).</span>$
(5)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since the layer of small S-boxes (S) and the layer of big S-boxes (T) are both of degree 7, and since the MDS layer L ensures that all outputs depend on all inputs, we have that  <span class="math">\\mu_i</span>  is always of degree  <span class="math">T^2 = 49</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For XHash8, the situation is similar except that we introduce fewer such variables (only 8 per rounds), and that the polynomial constraints take as input the variables from all the previous rounds, not only the immediate predecessor. It complicates writing a closed formula for these constraints, but they can be generated recursively starting from the first one with a computer program that updates the expression of the polynomials corresponding to the &quot;identity&quot; boxes in the high degree layer and keeps those in memory. We then get equations of the form</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(y_i^{i+1})^7 = \\mu_i&#x27;(y^i, y^{i-1}, ..., y^1, x)</span>$
(6)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As for  <span class="math">\\mu_i</span> , the polynomials  <span class="math">\\mu&#x27;_i</span>  are of degree 49 in  <span class="math">y^i</span> . However, their degree in the previous variables is higher since each of those went through operations of degree 49 during each round.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Final Rounds. For the final round, we do not introduce any new variable. However, we add one equation per word whose value needs to be set to a specific value. Essentially, we get several affine combinations of the image under the big S-box of the  <span class="math">y_j^r</span>  and (for XHash8) some complex polynomials in all the previous variables which we denote  <span class="math">\\omega_i</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Bypassing Rounds. A natural attack angle at this stage is to try and simplify the system using the knowledge of its structure, a trick usually achieved by carefully tracking the propagation of some affine spaces. This was applied with some success to several SPNs in [8], and even more so against both Griffin and Arion [7] due to the specifics of their non-linear layer&mdash;in particular, the fact that the non-linear layer of Griffin is affine over large affine spaces.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, we could not find such heuristics here. In the first round, the first MDS layer restricts the control needed to apply the technique from [8]. The fact that the non-linear layer is of a very high degree everywhere<sup>6</sup> then prevents the applicability of the technique from [7]. The monomial-based non-linear layer could have potentially led to the existence of chains of subspaces, as in [13], but the dense and structure-less round constants are an effective counter-measure against it.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Furthermore, the use of the monomial over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p^3</span>  in the big S-box layer makes it complicated to play with the algebraic representation of several rounds by tightly interweaving its 3 input variables.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Overall, while the threat from &quot;free&quot; rounds might a priori be pressing due to the low total number of rounds, it seems like the built-in countermeasures make such threats impractical.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the end, we have two types of variables: the  <span class="math">x_j</span> , which corresponds to the input, and the  <span class="math">y_j^i</span> , which are grouped in layers corresponding to the round at which they are introduced. We order them using a weighted <em>grevlex</em> order, whereby variables  <span class="math">x_j</span>  have weight 1, and a variable  <span class="math">y_j^i</span>  (introduced during round i) has weight  <span class="math">\\alpha^{2i}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our system of equations is of the form</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">$$\\begin{cases}
0 = (y_0^0)^7 - \\alpha_0 (\\vec{x}) \\
&amp; \\dots \\
0 = (y_{\\ell-1}^0)^7 - \\alpha_{11} (\\vec{x}) \\
0 = (y_0^1)^7 - \\mu_0 (\\vec{x}, \\vec{y^0}) \\
&amp; \\dots \\
0 = (y_{\\ell-1}^{N_r})^7 - \\mu_0 (\\vec{x}, \\vec{y^0}, \\dots, \\vec{y^{N_r-1}}) \\
0 = \\omega_0 (\\vec{x}, \\vec{y^0}, \\dots, \\vec{y^{N_r}}) \\
&amp; \\dots \\
0 = \\omega_4 (\\vec{x}, \\vec{y^0}, \\dots, \\vec{y^{N_r}}) ,
\\end{cases}$$
(7)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">\\ell = 8</span>  for XHash8 and  <span class="math">\\ell = 12</span>  for XHash12.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">By construction, our custom ordering ensures that the leading monomials in all the starting and middle equations are different variables (namely, all the  <span class="math">y_j^i</span> ). For XHash8, in the case where we only try to force one 0 in the input and in the output, this is exactly a FreeLunch system: the leading monomial in the last equation is of the form  <span class="math">x_0^{49(r+1)}</span> , meaning that it is yet another variable and that the whole system is a Gr&ouml;bner basis out-of-the-box.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Unfortunately, it is not the case for XHash12, or when the number of attacked output blocks (and thus the number of variables in  <span class="math">\\vec{x}</span> ) is at least equal to 2. Still, we do have that the leading monomials in all but the final equations are pairwise distinct.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">On XHash12. In XHash12, the input variables do not play a specific role since the inverse monomial layers are full. Indeed, we lose the ability to force the input variables to play a specific role in the last round, and thus cannot have the  <span class="math">x_j</span>  be the only variables in the leading monomials in any equation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We thus considered alternative strategies to build the system of equations for XHash12, and in particular to build the weights so that they decrease with the number of rounds, thus forcing the  <span class="math">x_i</span>  to be the leading terms in the first round, the  <span class="math">\\vec{y^i}</span>  to be the leading terms in the second round, etc. However, the inner workings of the round function prevented us from going further: it is &quot;easy&quot; to force  <span class="math">y^d</span>  to be the leading term of an equation of the form  <span class="math">y^d - P(\\vec{y}, \\vec{x})</span> , but much more complicated to pick a specific variable intervening in the rather dense polynomial P, and have it be the only variable in the leading monomial of such an equation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the end, we use the same encoding for XHash12 as we do for XHash8, and in fact can be built using the same program.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"> <span class="math">&lt;sup&gt;^6\\&lt;/sup&gt;mathrm{Except}</span>  for XHash8, where some inverse monomials are not applied, but this is of no consequence here.</p>

      <h3 id="app-c.3" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">C.3 Experimental Results</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is easy to design (and implement) a system of equations corresponding to an attack against a greatly simplified XHash8, differing from the real one in the following ways.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Use  <span class="math">x \\mapsto x^3</span>  as a small S-box,</li>
      <li>Use a lower value for p (namely,  <span class="math">p = 2^{16} 17</span> ) such that  <span class="math">x \\mapsto x^3</span>  is a permutation,</li>
      <li>Decrease the number of branches and consider different patterns for the application of the cubic roots.</li>
      <li>resize the big S-box to operate on  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p^2</span>  rather than  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p^3</span> ; and allow its replacement by a simple (full) layer of branch-wide monomials (to better understand the impact of big S-boxes).</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The attached Python script does just that. We call  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  the number of cubic roots applied in parallel in each round (so that  <span class="math">\\ell = 8</span>  for XHash8 for instance), and w the number both of  <span class="math">x_i</span>  and of final equations.<sup>7</sup></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Confirming the MIDC.. Running experiments on a small number of rounds, we have found that the Monotonous Ideal Degree Conjecture held. In fact, a stronger result seems to hold in the case of XHash8: In this case, the ideal degree seems equal to</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\underbrace{d^{\\ell r}}_{y_i} \\times \\underbrace{d^{k \\times 2r}}_{x_i},</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">which is  <span class="math">d^{(k-1)2r}</span>  times bigger than the bound given by the conjecture.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">On the Impact of T. The much denser T operation (operating over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p^3</span> ) does not influence the degree of the ideal. In that sense, it a priori does not provide more resistance against algebraic attacks than a simpler layer of monomials applied on each branch.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, in practice, it does imply some important properties. First, its greater density means that all the polynomials have an observable higher Hamming weight&mdash;a property that gets stronger as the exponent increases. This means that the equations are hard to generate and manipulate, and that targeting the (elimination of) specific terms is likely to be much more complicated. More importantly, making the polynomials denser is important to prevent the algorithm targeting sparse systems from becoming applicable.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Furthermore, by operating on several words at once, it prevents an attacker from singling out any of them. Being able to do this is important to select which variables to pick as the leading monomials, or to find heuristics to bypass rounds for free. As a consequence, we consider that these layers offer a significant security increase, albeit not one that is directly visible in the ideal degree.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Comparing XHash8 and XHash12. Unsurprisingly, computing the actual value of  <span class="math">D_I</span>  takes a lot longer for a simplified XHash with a full layer of cubic roots. Intuitively, this makes sense: in this case, the polynomials obtained are further from being a Gr&ouml;bner basis, and thus SAGE needs to work harder to obtain one to compute this quantity.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;7</sup>We need these to be equal to maintain an ideal of dimension 0.</p>

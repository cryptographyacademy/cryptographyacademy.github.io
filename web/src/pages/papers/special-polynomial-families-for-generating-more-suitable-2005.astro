      <p class="text-gray-300">Constructing non-supersingular elliptic curves for pairing-based cryptosystems have attracted much attention in recent years. The best previous technique builds curves with p = lg(q)/lg(r) = 1 (k = 12) and p = lg(q)/lg(r) = 1.25 (k = 24). When k &gt; 12, most of the previous works address the question by representing r(x) as a cyclotomic polynomial. In this paper, we propose a new method to find more pairing-friendly elliptic curves with arbitrary embedding degree k by certain special polynomial families. The new method generates curves with lg(q)/lg(r) = 1 (k &gt; 48) by random forms of r(x). Different representations of r(x) allow us to obtain many new families of pairing-friendly elliptic curves. In addition, we propose a equation to illustrate how to obtain small values of p by choosing appropriate forms of discriminant D and trace t. Numerous parameters of certain pairing-friendly elliptic curves are presented with support for the theoretical conclusions.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-misc-1" class="text-2xl font-bold"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">After the propositions of identity-based encryption scheme [12] and short signature scheme [13], paring-based cryptography has attracted significant attention in modern public-key cryptography. Over pairing-based cryptosystems, Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) on supersingular elliptic curves can be reduced to Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) over an extension field by Weil Pairing [10] or Tate Paring [15]. Although supersingular elliptic curves provides high efficiency for pairing-based cryptosystems [19, 20], since these curves only can be built when embedding degree k &le; 6 [11], researchers have explored other form of curves, e.g. non-supersingular elliptic curves.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In 2001, Miyaji, Nakabayashi and Takano [8] first proposed a method to find suitable non-supersingular elliptic curves for pairing-based cryptosystems. They discussed the problem from the point of view of tract <em>t</em>. Scott and Barreto [1] extended the method of Miyaji <em>et al.</em> and found more suitable non-supersingular elliptic curves when <em>k</em> &isin; <em>[3, 4, 6]</em>. Gallbraith, Mckee and Valenca [3] summarized the method proposed by early researchers and presented some appropriate families of group orders of such elliptic curves when embedding degree <em>k</em> &le; <em>6</em>. Duan, Cui and Chan [5] extended the work of Gallbraith <em>et al</em>. by proposing the idea of effective polynomial families of pairing-friendly elliptic curves.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For larger values of <em>k</em>, Brezing and Weng proposed an alternative method to find these curves [7]. They used <em>t</em> <sup>&minus;</sup> <em>1</em> as a kth root of unity modulo prime <em>r</em>. They generated the curves with best performance so far as <em>lg(q)/lg(r) = 1.25</em> (<em>k = 24</em>). Dupont, Enge and Morain [16] proposed another method for finding the suitable nonsupersingular elliptic curves. Most of the curves they found had <em>lg(q)/lg(r)</em> &asymp; <em>2</em>. In their method, tract <em>t</em> was chosen large enough to make <em>4q &ndash; t2</em> small as to produce effective values of <em>D</em>. Barreto and Naehrig [17] generated non-supersingular elliptic curves with <em>lg(q)/lg(r) = 1</em> when embedding degree <em>k = 12</em>. They presented the best curves with prime group order known so far. Their work was actually generated by a special polynomial family of <em>q(x)</em>, <em>t(x)</em> and <em>r(x)</em>, where <em>4q(x) &ndash; t2 (x)</em> can be factorized as one square polynomial multiplying with one constant number. In the most recent work, Murphy and Fitzpatrick [4] extended the work of Brezing <em>et al</em>. and generated pairing-friendly elliptic curves over prime fields with discriminant <em>D &gt; 4</em> for arbitrary values of <em>k</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper we propose a new method for finding more pairing-friendly elliptic curves. Compared to the previous works, we explicitly present the special polynomial families for generating elliptic curves suitable for pairing-based cryptosystmes with arbitrary values of embedding degree <em>k</em>. We also illustrate the relation to obtain small values of &rho; by choosing appropriate forms of discriminant <em>D</em>, trace <em>t</em> and embedding degree <em>k</em>. Our method allows to find more pairing-friendly elliptic curves with higher security (<em>k &ge; 48</em>) and more efficiency (<sup>&rho;</sup> <sup>&le;</sup> <em>1.2</em>) by various representations of <em>r(x)</em>. In fact, the work of Brezing <em>et al</em>. [17] and Murphy <em>et al</em>. [4] can be represented as a special case of our new method, since they implement <em>r(x)</em> only as cyclotomic polynomials in their work.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This paper is organized as the follows. In Sections 2 we give a description of the mathematics background. In Section 3 we present the new method and discuss the difference compared with previous works. In Section 4 certain special polynomial families of pairing-friendly elliptic curves with random forms of <em>r(x)</em> and arbitrary embedding degree <em>k</em> are presented. In addition, we propose the idea to construct curves with &rho; <em>= lg(q)/lg(r)</em> &asymp; <em>1</em> for large values of <em>k</em> &ge; <em>48</em>. We draw the conclusion in Section 5. The parameters of some pairing-friendly elliptic curves, based on the proposed polynomial families, are presented in Appendix (a), (b), (c) and (d) over prime fields.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-misc-2" class="text-2xl font-bold"><strong>2. Mathematics Background</strong></h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To find suitable elliptic curves for pairing-based cryptosystems, we need to solve certain equations. Assume the cofactor <em>h</em> is an integer, <em>r</em> is the order of a point as a big prime number and <em>t</em> is the trace of an elliptic curve, we want to find an elliptic curve over <em>Fq</em>, where <em>q = p</em> is a prime number (we only consider the prime fields in this paper). ECDLP on such elliptic curves can be reduced to DLP over <em>F<sup>q</sup> k</em> , where <em>k</em> is the smallest integer satisfying certain conditions, defined as the embedding degree [1]. The following equations determine whether such an elliptic curve exists or not.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In a strict sense, to find the suitable elliptic curves for pairing-based cryptosystems [10], we need</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$r \\mid q^k - I \\tag{1}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, under a mild condition [6], we just consider <em>q</em> as a kth root of unity modulo <em>r</em> [7]. Meanwhile, since <em>k</em> is the smallest integer satisfying <em>r | qk &ndash; 1</em>, equation (1) should be presented as <em>r | qk &ndash; 1</em> and <em>q i &ndash; 1</em> is not divisible by <em>r</em> when 0 &lt; <em>i &lt; k</em>. From [14] we have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$dr = \\Phi_k(q) \\tag{2}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <em>d</em> is an integer and &Phi;<em>k(q)</em> is the cyclotomic polynomial of <em>q</em> with embedding degree <em>k</em> and</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$d&#x27;r \\neq \\Phi_i(q), \\ 0 &lt; i &lt; k \\tag{3}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Besides these conditions we need</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$hr = q + 1 - t \\tag{4}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <em>h</em> is an integer. Combining equation (2) and (4) together, we obtain</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$sr = \\Phi_k(t-1) \\tag{5}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <em>s</em> is also an integer [1]. Since k is the smallest integer, we have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$s&#x27;r \\neq \\Phi_i(t-1), \\ 0 &lt; i &lt; k \\tag{6}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">By Hasse's bound we need</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$|t| \\le 2q^{1/2} \\tag{7}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With all the above equations, we compute the elliptic curve by solving</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$DV^2 = 4q - t^2 \\tag{8}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <em>D</em> is chosen by certain conditions [2].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">All the above equations aim for finding suitable elliptic curves for pairing-based cryptosystems in integer fields. But it is impossible to search the whole integer fields to obtain the suitable solutions. We should transfer the problem into polynomial fields. When analyzing in polynomial fields, we assume <em>q</em>, <em>t</em>, <em>r</em> as <em>q(x)</em>, <em>t(x)</em> and <em>r(x)</em>;</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">meanwhile <em>h</em>, <em>d</em>, <em>s</em>, <em>D</em> and <em>V</em> should be considered as <em>h(x)</em>, <em>d(x)</em>, <em>s(x)</em>, <em>D(x)</em> and <em>V(x)</em>. Duan <em>et al</em>. [5] have proposed a lemma which illustrates the fact that in polynomial fields, equation (2) and (5) are already both sufficient and necessary conditions. Thus for finding suitable elliptic curves for pairing-based cryptosystems in polynomial fields, the equations (2, 4, 5, 7, 8) are required and rewritten as:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$d(x)r(x) = \\Phi_k(q(x)) \\tag{9}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$h(x)r(x) = q(x) + 1 - t(x)</span>$
(10)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$s(x)r(x) = \\Phi_k(t(x) - 1) \\tag{11}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$|t(x)| &lt; 2q(x)^{1/2} \\tag{12}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$D(x)V(x)^{2} = 4q(x) - t^{2}(x)</span>$
(13)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">How to build pairing-friendly elliptic curves by finding the polynomial families satisfying equation (9) to (13) were presented in [1, 3, 5, 8, 17]. Most of the work concentrated on embedding degree <em>k</em> &le; <em>6</em>. Only one special polynomial family whe <em>k = 12</em> was found by Barreto <em>et al</em>. [17], which built the best curves with prime group order known so far.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For larger values of <em>k</em>, the polynomial families of <em>q(x)</em>, <em>t(x)</em> and <em>r(x)</em> will not satisy all the conditions from equation (9) to (13). Only some of the parameters will maintain the polynomial relations and the other ones will only be valid for certain <em>x</em> as <em>x0</em>. Brezing and Weng [7] proposed a method to find these curves. In their method, in polynomial fields, <em>t(x)</em> and <em>r(x)</em> will satisfy equation (11) by representing <em>t(x) &ndash; 1</em> as a kth root of unity modulo <em>r(x)</em>. The irreducible polynomial <em>r(x)</em> is always set as a cyclotomic polynomial. <em>q</em> and <em>DV<sup>2</sup></em> will not have the polynomial relations. They can not be represented as polynomials in cyclotomic fields. But all the parameters are satisfying equations (9) - (13) for a specific <em>x0</em>. In the next section, we will present a new method for finding more pairing-friendly elliptic curves with arbitrary embeddin degree <em>k</em> by some special polynomial families. The new method allows <em>r(x)</em> to be an irreducible polynomial with different forms.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section the math evidence for the new method is provided. As proposed in [7], from equation (4) and (8), difference between <em>4q</em> and <em>t <sup>2</sup></em> can be obtained after finding <em>t</em> and <em>r</em>:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$DV^{2} = 4q - t^{2} = 4(hr + t - 1) - t^{2}</span>$
(14)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Represented in polynomial fields, equation (16) can be rewritten as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$DV^{2}(x) = 4h(x)r(x) - (t(x) - 2)^{2}</span>$
(15)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where D is a square-free integer. This is a standard polynomial family of pairing-friendly elliptic curves proposed in [1, 3, 5, 8, 17] with the satisfaction to equation (9) - (13). In polynomial fields, choose r(x) and t(x) as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$s(x)r(x) = \\Phi_k(t(x) - 1)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This can be viewed as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$r(x) \\mid \\Phi_k(t(x) - 1) \\tag{16}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We should mention that polynomial families are hard to find for large values of k (e.g. k &gt; 12) when equation (15) is satisfied. To find more curves, we choose suitable r(x) and t(x) satisfying equation (16). Then for a specific  <span class="math">x_0</span> , assuming equation (15) is satisfied, this can be presented as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$DV^{2}(x_{0}) = 4h(x_{0})r(x_{0}) - (t(x_{0}) - 2)^{2}</span>$
(17)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Dividing D from both sides of equation (17), we have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$V^{2}(x_{0}) = \\left[4h(x_{0})r(x_{0}) / D\\right] - \\left[t(x_{0}) - 2\\right]^{2} / D \\tag{18}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">4h(x_0)r(x_0)</span>  and  <span class="math">[t(x_0) - 2]^2</span>  divides D. Assuming  <span class="math">[t(x_0) - 2]^2 \\mid 4Dh(x_0)</span> , equation (18) can be rewritten as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$V^{2}(x_{0}) = \\{ [t(x_{0}) - 2]^{2} / D^{2} \\} \\{ [4Dh(x_{0})r(x_{0}) / (t(x_{0}) - 2)^{2}] - D \\}</span>$
(19)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Here we use a technique to consider  <span class="math">4Dh(x_0)/(t(x_0)-2)^2</span>  as a polynomial h'(x) for certain  <span class="math">x_0</span> . This means for a specific  <span class="math">x_0</span> ,  <span class="math">4Dh(x_0)</span>  divides  <span class="math">[t(x_0)-2]^2</span>  and it can be represented in polynomial fields as a polynomial h'(x). Then equation (19) can be represented as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$V^{2}(x_{0}) = \\{ [t(x_{0}) - 2]^{2} / D^{2} \\} \\{ h&#x27;(x)r(x) - D \\}</span>$
(20)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Thus if h'(x)r(x) - D can be viewed as a square polynomial  <span class="math">S^2(x)</span> , in equation (20) all parameters have square forms. If  <span class="math">h&#x27;(x)r(x) - D = S^2(x)</span> , for any suitable  <span class="math">x_0</span> , equation (20) is satisfied and can be written as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$V^{2}(x_{0}) = \\{ [t(x_{0}) - 2]^{2} / D^{2} \\} S^{2}(x)</span>$
(21)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This equation represents a modified polynomial family. For the specific  <span class="math">x_0</span> , we have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$DV^{2}(x_{0}) = \\{ [t(x_{0}) - 2]^{2} / D \\} S^{2}(x_{0})</span>$
(22)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Representing equation (14) into equation (22), we obtain</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$q = [t^{2}(x_{0}) + DV^{2}(x_{0})] / 4</span>$
(23)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We choose  <span class="math">x_0</span>  as to satisfy that  <span class="math">r(x_0)</span>  is a prime integer. Then for the specific  <span class="math">x_0</span> , if  <span class="math">q = [t^2(x_0) + DV^2(x_0)] / 4</span>  is a prime integer, we find all the suitable parameters with satisfaction to a pairing-friendly elliptic curve.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The main idea can be presented as the following procedures. First we choose a specific r(x) and trace polynomial t(x) with  <span class="math">r(x) \\mid \\Phi_k(t(x) - 1)</span> . Then after choosing a suitable discriminant D, we find polynomial families h'(x) satisfying that  <span class="math">h&#x27;(x)r(x) - D = S^2(x)</span>  as a square polynomial. In the following steps, we choose a suitable  <span class="math">x_0</span>  with  <span class="math">r(x_0)</span>  is a prime integer and test whether  <span class="math">q = \\{t^2(x_0) + [(t(x_0) - 2)^2 \\mid D]S(x_0)\\} \\mid 4</span>  is also a prime integer. Is q is according to the conditions, we have found the suitable parameters of a pairing-friendly elliptic curves. In the procedure,  <span class="math">4Dh(x_0) \\mid (t(x_0) - 2)^2 = h&#x27;(x)</span> ,  <span class="math">D \\mid 4h(x_0)</span>  and  <span class="math">D \\mid [t(x_0) - 2]^2</span>  are three hidden conditions since we represent h'(x) as a polynomial.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The main step in the new method is to find a suitable discriminant <em>D</em> and special polynomial families <em>h'(x)</em>, <em>r(x)</em>, <em>S(x)</em> with <em>h'(x)r(x) &ndash; D = S2 (x)</em>. The other work to test prime <em>r(x0)</em> and <em>q(x0)</em> is trivial. When <em>r(x)</em> is taken as a standard cyclotomic polynomial, finding suitable <em>S(x)</em> is equal to find the polynomial representations of <em>(- D)1/2</em> in cyclotomic fields. This is because</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$S^{2}(x) + D \\equiv 0 \\bmod r(x) \\tag{24}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In such circumstances, our method is same with the methods proposed by Brezing and Weng [7] since equation (24) can be rewritten as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$DV^{2}(x) = \\{ [t(x) - 2]^{2} / D \\} S^{2}(x)</span>$
(25)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <em>S(x)</em> is the representation of <em>(-D)1/2</em> in cyclotomic fields. This equation is same as the main relation proposed in [7]. Thus the work of Brezing <em>et al</em>. is a special case of our new method since in their method <em>r(x)</em> is only taken as a standard cyclotomic polynomial. Our proposed method ignores the restrictions imposed on the form of <em>r(x)</em>. By our method more pairing-friendly elliptic curves are found by various forms of <em>r(x)</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Based on the above analysis, we propose a new algorithm for finding the suitable pairing-friendly elliptic curves.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Because the key procedure of the new method is to find special polynomial families <em>h'(x)</em>, <em>r(x)</em> and <em>S<sup>2</sup> (x)</em>, in the next section we will list some polynomial families with different embedding degree <em>k</em>, &rho; <em>= lg(q)/lg(r)</em> and <em>r(x)</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we will present some special polynomial families obtained by the new method.

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Table 2 we tabulate all the possible special polynomial families when k = 28. When r(x) is fixed as a cyclotomic polynomial with embedding degree k, h'(x) and t(x) should be chosen with smallest degrees. Thus t(x) always should be taken as x + 1 if  <span class="math">r(x) = \\Phi_k(x)</span> . Although in cyclotomic fields we can modulo  <span class="math">S^2(x_0)[t(x_0) - 2)]^2 / D</span>  by  <span class="math">\\Phi_k(x_0)</span>  to a smaller integer; from the deductions of section 3 we can find that the best choice is still to set t(x) as x + 1.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 2: Special polynomial families when k = 12, 14, 15</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Brezing <em>et al.</em> [7] and Murphy <em>et al.</em> [4] have implemented r(x) as  <span class="math">\\Phi_{ik}(x)</span>  for a given embedding degree k, where i is an integer. In fact, such techniques can not obtain elliptic curves with smaller values of  <span class="math">\\rho</span> . First we analyze the situation when k is an even number. When r(x) is taken as  <span class="math">\\Phi_{ik}(x)</span> , we have  <span class="math">degree(r(x)) = degree(\\Phi_{ik}(x))</span>  =  <span class="math">i \\times degree(\\Phi_{k}(x))</span> ; meanwhile, we have  <span class="math">i \\times degree(t(x))</span>  and  <span class="math">i \\times degree(h&#x27;(x))</span> . Thus the value of  <span class="math">\\rho</span>  is not related to the choice of cyclotomic polynomials since the degrees of r(x), t(x) and h'(x) are increased with same multiples. When k is an odd number, the analysis is similar. Brezing <em>et al.</em> [7] have found the best curves with  <span class="math">\\rho \\approx 1.25</span> , k = 24. They took r(x) as  <span class="math">\\Phi_{48}(x)</span>  and t(x) as  <span class="math">x^2 + 1</span> . In Table 3, we tabulate some polynomial families when k = 24 which illustrates that  <span class="math">\\rho \\approx 1.25</span>  is also obtained for k = 24 when t(x) = x + 1,  <span class="math">r(x) = \\Phi_{24}(x)</span> . These polynomial families prove that the value of  <span class="math">\\rho</span>  has no relation with the choice of the degrees of  <span class="math">\\Phi_k(x)</span>  and t(x).</p>

      <h3 id="sec-4.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.2 Special Polynomial Families with Arbitrary Values of k</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As finding the special polynomial families, we notice a fact which can be implemented to construct pairing-friendly elliptic curves with arbitrary embedding degree k. When k is an even integer,  <span class="math">\\Phi_{sk}(x)</span>  will have the same form as  <span class="math">\\Phi_k(x)</span>  where  <span class="math">s=2^i</span>  (i is a positive integer). The only difference is that x in  <span class="math">\\Phi_k(x)</span>  will be represented as  <span class="math">x^s</span>  in  <span class="math">\\Phi_{sk}(x)</span> . Meanwhile, h'(x) will also have the same property. Thus if we find a special polynomial family for embedding degree k, we can easily obtain the families with the same forms for embedding degree sk ( <span class="math">s=2^i</span> ). The only work is to represent x as  <span class="math">x^s</span> , where s is a positive integer power of s.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The beauty of this property is to find curves with larger embedding degree k with smaller  <span class="math">\\rho</span> . It is because  <span class="math">\\rho = 1 + [2degree(t(x)) + degree(h&#x27;(x))] / degree(r(x))</span> . When degree of r(x) is increased with same multiples of h'(x), if the degree of t(x) is not changed, the value of  <span class="math">\\rho</span>  will be decreased. When h'(x) is a constant integer, the situations are more easily to analyze. Since if we always choose t(x) as x + 1, the values of  <span class="math">\\rho</span>  equals 1 + [2 / degree(r(x))]. By choosing larger values of embedding degree k, the degree of r(x) will increase, then the value of  <span class="math">\\rho</span>  will be decreased (but it can not reach l for ever).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Koblitz and Menezes [18] have suggested to find pairing-friendly elliptic curves</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">with  <span class="math">k=2^i3^j</span>  as large as possible. In Table 4, we tabulate the polynomial families when k=12, 24, 48, 96. The value of  <span class="math">\\rho</span>  is decreased close to 1 when taking larger values of k. Since in these families the value of h is always 4, the small values of  <span class="math">\\rho</span>  is obtained when k=96. When k=48, we construct the parameters of certain paringfriendly elliptic curves with  <span class="math">\\rho \\approx 1</span> . 125. When k=96, we construct the parameters of certain paring-friendly elliptic curves with  <span class="math">\\rho \\approx 1</span> . 06. These curves have better performance compared to previous works, since they have smaller values of  <span class="math">\\rho</span>  for larger values of k. The results are presented in Appendix (b).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 4: More special polynomial families when k = 12, 24, 48, 96</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With this technique we could find any pairing-friendly elliptic curves with arbitrary embedding degree k, e.g. finding curves with larger k than 96 is not a hard task. But since the suitable values of x become sparse when k is increased, finding parameters of elliptic curves with the essential security level (r is a 160 bits prime) [9] is more difficult with large k. This is the reason we find the parameters of an elliptic curve with r as a 416 bits prime integer when k = 96. In addition, it is still not aware how large the embedding degree k should be for a pairing-friendly curve with best performance. (To find curves with prime r close to 160 bits integer for larger values of k, e.g. k = 96, we should use some other techniques. This question will be further discussed in section 4.4.)</p>

      <h3 id="sec-4.3" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.3 Special Polynomial Families with Different Forms of r(x)</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Brezing and Weng [7] had successfully found pairing-friendly elliptic curves with arbitrary embedding degree. But the limitation of their work was that r(x) was only represented as the standard cyclotomic polynomial. It was because their method was to derive kth roots of unity and polynomial representations of  <span class="math">(-D)^{1/2}</span>  in the cyclotomic fields. They did not provide any explanations to the circumstances when r(x) was taken as an arbitrary irreducible polynomial. The work of Murphy and Fitzpatrick [4] was also based on the standard representations of r(x) as  <span class="math">\\Phi_k(x)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our method ignores the limitation imposed on the forms of r(x) since we only need to find h'(x) and D with  <span class="math">h&#x27;(x)r(x) - D = S^2(x)</span> . For this point, r(x) can be any irreducible polynomials satisfying  <span class="math">r(x) \\mid \\Phi_k(t(x) - 1)</span> . This allows us to find much more ellitpc curves by various representations of r(x). In Table 5 we tabulate more special polynomial families with different r(x) when k = 12, 14 and 28. The trace t(x) is taken</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">with degree as small as possible to obtain desired values of  <span class="math">\\rho</span> . In Appendix (c) we generate certain parameters of pairing-friendly elliptic curves by the polynomial families listed in Table 5.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 5 just tabulates some new polynomial families of different r(x) when k = 12, 14 and 28. When the irreducible polynomial r(x) is not limited as a cyclotomic polynomial, more values of the discriminant D will be suitable for generating pairingfriendly elliptic curves. Appendix (c) presents parameters of curves with D=3 when embedding degree k = 14 and 28. Such curves have not been proposed in any relative works before. By the new method, more polynomial families can be found for other values of k. It is no way to list all the special polynomial families with various values of embedding degree k. Table 6 presents such special polynomial families with different forms of r(x) when k = 13, 14 and 15. These new polynomial families will be implemented for finding much more pairing-friendly elliptic curves.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-4.4" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.4 More r with a small factor</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In fact, when it is allowed that r contains a small factor s as r = sn (n is a prime larger than  <span class="math">2^{160}</span> ), much more suitable elliptic curves are found. The same technique has been used in [1]. When  <span class="math">r = s \\times n</span> , n should be a large prime bigger than  <span class="math">2^{160}</span>  [9] and cofactor h will be multiplied with the small factor s. Brezing et al. [7] and Murphy et al. [4] only implemented r as a large prime in their methods. By our method it is easy to find that the condition of prime r(x) can be loosed to r = sn without effecting the values of  <span class="math">\\rho</span>  much. Thus more elliptic curves different with their work are found. The value of  <span class="math">\\rho</span>  will not increase much if s is carefully chosen. In Appendix (d), we presented some examples with this technique when <em>k = 96</em>. By this technique, we effectively decrease the length of <em>r</em>.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-misc-4" class="text-2xl font-bold"><strong>5. Conclusion</strong></h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper, we propose a new method to find more pairing-friendly elliptic curves with arbitrary embedding degree <em>k</em> by certain special polynomial families. This method allows us to obtain new families of pairing-friendly elliptic curves by representing <em>r(x)</em> with various forms. In addition, we propose a new technique to let prime <em>r</em> contain a small factor <em>s</em>. Numerous parameters of new pairing-friendly elliptic curves are found with the proposed method. These curves have higher security (<em>k &ge; 48</em>) and more efficiency (<sup>&rho;</sup> <sup>&le;</sup> <em>1.2</em>) compared to the previous work for paring-based cryptosystems.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Abstract</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Constructing non-supersingular elliptic curves for pairing-based cryptosystems have attracted much attention in recent years. The best previous technique builds curves with <span class="math">\\rho = \\lg(q)/\\lg(r) \\approx 1</span> (<span class="math">k = 12</span>) and <span class="math">\\rho = \\lg(q)/\\lg(r) \\approx 1.25</span> (<span class="math">k = 24</span>). When <span class="math">k &amp;gt; 12</span>, most of the previous works address the question by representing <span class="math">r(x)</span> as a cyclotomic polynomial. In this paper, we propose a new method to find more pairing-friendly elliptic curves with arbitrary embedding degree <span class="math">k</span> by certain special polynomial families. The new method generates curves with <span class="math">\\lg(q)/\\lg(r) \\approx 1</span> (<span class="math">k \\geq 48</span>) by random forms of <span class="math">r(x)</span>. Different representations of <span class="math">r(x)</span> allow us to obtain many new families of pairing-friendly elliptic curves. In addition, we propose a equation to illustrate how to obtain small values of <span class="math">\\rho</span> by choosing appropriate forms of discriminant <span class="math">D</span> and trace <span class="math">t</span>. Numerous parameters of certain pairing-friendly elliptic curves are presented with support for the theoretical conclusions.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">After the propositions of identity-based encryption scheme [12] and short signature scheme [13], paring-based cryptography has attracted significant attention in modern public-key cryptography. Over pairing-based cryptosystems, Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) on supersingular elliptic curves can be reduced to Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) over an extension field by Weil Pairing [10] or Tate Paring [15]. Although supersingular elliptic curves provide high efficiency for pairing-based cryptosystems [19, 20], since these curves only can be built when</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">embedding degree  <span class="math">\\mathrm{k} \\leq 6</span>  [11], researchers have explored other forms of curves, e.g. non-supersingular elliptic curves.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In 2001, Miyaji, Nakabayashi and Takano [8] first proposed a method to find suitable non-supersingular elliptic curves for pairing-based cryptosystems. They discussed the problem from the point of view of tract  <span class="math">t</span> . Scott and Barreto [1] extended the method of Miyaji et al. and found more suitable non-supersingular elliptic curves when  <span class="math">k \\in [3,4,6]</span> . Gallbraith, Mckee and Valenca [3] summarized the method proposed by early researchers and presented some appropriate families of group orders of such elliptic curves when embedding degree  <span class="math">k \\leq 6</span> . Duan, Cui and Chan [5] extended the work of Gallbraith et al. by proposing the idea of effective polynomial families of pairing-friendly elliptic curves.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For larger values of  <span class="math">k</span> , Brezing and Weng proposed an alternative method to find these curves [7]. They used  <span class="math">t - 1</span>  as a kth root of unity modulo prime  <span class="math">r</span> . They generated the curves with best performance so far as  <span class="math">\\lg(q) / \\lg(r) = 1.25</span>  ( <span class="math">k = 24</span> ). Dupont, Enge and Morain [16] proposed another method for finding the suitable non-supersingular elliptic curves. Most of the curves they found had  <span class="math">\\lg(q) / \\lg(r) \\approx 2</span> . In their method, tract  <span class="math">t</span>  was chosen large enough to make  <span class="math">4q - t^2</span>  small as to produce effective values of  <span class="math">D</span> . Barreto and Naehrig [17] generated non-supersingular elliptic curves with  <span class="math">\\lg(q) / \\lg(r) = 1</span>  when embedding degree  <span class="math">k = 12</span> . They presented the best curves with prime group order known so far. Their work was actually generated by a special polynomial family of  <span class="math">q(x)</span> ,  <span class="math">t(x)</span>  and  <span class="math">r(x)</span> , where  <span class="math">4q(x) - t^2(x)</span>  can be factorized as one square polynomial multiplying with one constant number. In the most recent work, Murphy and Fitzpatrick [4] extended the work of Brezing et al. and generated pairing-friendly elliptic curves over prime fields with discriminant  <span class="math">D &amp;gt; 4</span>  for arbitrary values of  <span class="math">k</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper we propose a new method for finding more pairing-friendly elliptic curves. Compared to the previous works, we explicitly present the special polynomial families for generating elliptic curves suitable for pairing-based cryptosystems with arbitrary values of embedding degree  <span class="math">k</span> . We also illustrate the relation to obtain small values of  <span class="math">\\rho</span>  by choosing appropriate forms of discriminant  <span class="math">D</span> , trace  <span class="math">t</span>  and embedding degree  <span class="math">k</span> . Our method allows to find more pairing-friendly elliptic curves with higher security ( <span class="math">k \\geq 48</span> ) and more efficiency ( <span class="math">\\rho \\leq 1.2</span> ) by various representations of  <span class="math">r(x)</span> . In fact, the work of Brezing et al. [17] and Murphy et al. [4] can be represented as a special case of our new method, since they implement  <span class="math">r(x)</span>  only as cyclotomic polynomials in their work.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This paper is organized as the follows. In Sections 2 we give a description of the mathematics background. In Section 3 we present the new method and discuss the difference compared with previous works. In Section 4 certain special polynomial families of pairing-friendly elliptic curves with random forms of  <span class="math">r(x)</span>  and arbitrary embedding degree  <span class="math">k</span>  are presented. In addition, we propose the idea to construct</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">curves with <span class="math">\\rho = \\lg(q)/\\lg(r) \\approx 1</span> for large values of <span class="math">k \\geq 48</span>. We draw the conclusion in Section 5. The parameters of some pairing-friendly elliptic curves, based on the proposed polynomial families, are presented in Appendix (a), (b), (c) and (d) over prime fields.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-1" class="text-2xl font-bold">2. Mathematics Background</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To find suitable elliptic curves for pairing-based cryptosystems, we need to solve certain equations. Assume the cofactor <span class="math">h</span> is an integer, <span class="math">r</span> is the order of a point as a big prime number and <span class="math">t</span> is the trace of an elliptic curve, we want to find an elliptic curve over <span class="math">F_q</span>, where <span class="math">q = p</span> is a prime number (we only consider the prime fields in this paper). ECDLP on such elliptic curves can be reduced to DLP over <span class="math">F_q^k</span>, where <span class="math">k</span> is the smallest integer satisfying certain conditions, defined as the embedding degree [1]. The following equations determine whether such an elliptic curve exists or not.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In a strict sense, to find the suitable elliptic curves for pairing-based cryptosystems [10], we need</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">r \\mid q^k - 1 \\tag{1}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, under a mild condition [6], we just consider <span class="math">q</span> as a kth root of unity modulo <span class="math">r</span> [7]. Meanwhile, since <span class="math">k</span> is the smallest integer satisfying <span class="math">r \\mid q^k - 1</span>, equation (1) should be presented as <span class="math">r \\mid q^k - 1</span> and <span class="math">q^i - 1</span> is not divisible by <span class="math">r</span> when <span class="math">0 &amp;lt; i &amp;lt; k</span>. From [14] we have</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">dr = \\Phi_k(q) \\tag{2}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">d</span> is an integer and <span class="math">\\Phi_k(q)</span> is the cyclotomic polynomial of <span class="math">q</span> with embedding degree <span class="math">k</span> and</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">d&#x27;r \\neq \\Phi_l(q), \\quad 0 &amp;lt; i &amp;lt; k \\tag{3}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Besides these conditions we need</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">hr = q + 1 - t \\tag{4}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">h</span> is an integer. Combining equation (2) and (4) together, we obtain</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">sr = \\Phi_k(t - 1) \\tag{5}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">s</span> is also an integer [1]. Since <span class="math">k</span> is the smallest integer, we have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">D</span> is chosen by certain conditions [2].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">All the above equations aim for finding suitable elliptic curves for pairing-based cryptosystems in integer fields. But it is impossible to search the whole integer fields to obtain the suitable solutions. We should transfer the problem into polynomial fields. When analyzing in polynomial fields, we assume <span class="math">q</span>, <span class="math">t</span>, <span class="math">r</span> as <span class="math">q(x)</span>, <span class="math">t(x)</span> and <span class="math">r(x)</span>;</p>

Duan et al. [5] have proposed a lemma which illustrates the fact that in polynomial fields, equation (2) and (5) are already both sufficient and necessary conditions. Thus for finding suitable elliptic curves for pairing-based cryptosystems in polynomial fields, the equations (2, 4, 5, 7, 8) are required and rewritten as:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">How to build pairing-friendly elliptic curves by finding the polynomial families satisfying equation (9) to (13) were presented in [1, 3, 5, 8, 17]. Most of the work concentrated on embedding degree <span class="math">k \\leq 6</span>. Only one special polynomial family where <span class="math">k = 12</span> was found by Barreto et al. [17], which built the best curves with prime group order known so far.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For larger values of <span class="math">k</span>, the polynomial families of <span class="math">q(x)</span>, <span class="math">t(x)</span> and <span class="math">r(x)</span> will not satisfy all the conditions from equation (9) to (13). Only some of the parameters will maintain the polynomial relations and the other ones will only be valid for certain <span class="math">x</span> as <span class="math">x_0</span>. Brezing and Weng [7] proposed a method to find these curves. In their method, in polynomial fields, <span class="math">t(x)</span> and <span class="math">r(x)</span> will satisfy equation (11) by representing <span class="math">t(x) - 1</span> as a <span class="math">k</span>th root of unity modulo <span class="math">r(x)</span>. The irreducible polynomial <span class="math">r(x)</span> is always set as a cyclotomic polynomial. <span class="math">q</span> and <span class="math">DV^2</span> will not have the polynomial relations. They cannot be represented as polynomials in cyclotomic fields. But all the parameters are satisfying equations (9) - (13) for a specific <span class="math">x_0</span>. In the next section, we will present a new method for finding more pairing-friendly elliptic curves with arbitrary embeddings degree <span class="math">k</span> by some special polynomial families. The new method allows <span class="math">r(x)</span> to be an irreducible polynomial with different forms.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section the math evidence for the new method is provided. As proposed in [7], from equation (4) and (8), difference between <span class="math">4q</span> and <span class="math">t^2</span> can be obtained after finding <span class="math">t</span> and <span class="math">r</span>:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">DV^2 = 4q - t^2 = 4(hr + t - 1) - t^2 \\tag{14}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Represented in polynomial fields, equation (16) can be rewritten as</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">DV^2(x) = 4h(x) r(x) - (t(x) - 2)^2 \\tag{15}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">D</span> is a square-free integer. This is a standard polynomial family of pairing-friendly elliptic curves proposed in [1, 3, 5, 8, 17] with the satisfaction to equation (9) - (13). In polynomial fields, choose <span class="math">r(x)</span> and <span class="math">t(x)</span> as</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">s(x)r(x) = \\Phi_k(t(x) - 1)</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This can be viewed as</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">r(x) \\mid \\Phi_k(t(x) - 1) \\tag{16}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We should mention that polynomial families are hard to find for large values of <span class="math">k</span> (e.g. <span class="math">k &amp;gt; 12</span>) when equation (15) is satisfied. To find more curves, we choose suitable <span class="math">r(x)</span> and <span class="math">t(x)</span> satisfying equation (16). Then for a specific <span class="math">x_0</span>, assuming equation (15) is satisfied, this can be presented as</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">DV^2(x_0) = 4h(x_0)r(x_0) - (t(x_0) - 2)^2 \\tag{17}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Dividing <span class="math">D</span> from both sides of equation (17), we have</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">V^2(x_0) = \\left[ 4h(x_0)r(x_0)/D \\right] - \\left[ t(x_0) - 2 \\right]^2/D \\tag{18}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">4h(x_0)r(x_0)</span> and <span class="math">[t(x_0) - 2]^2</span> divides <span class="math">D</span>. Assuming <span class="math">[t(x_0) - 2]^2 \\mid 4Dh(x_0)</span>, equation (18) can be rewritten as</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">V^2(x_0) = \\left\\{ \\left[ t(x_0) - 2 \\right]^2 / D^2 \\right\\} \\left\\{ \\left[ 4Dh(x_0)r(x_0) / (t(x_0) - 2)^2 \\right] - D \\right\\} \\tag{19}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Here we use a technique to consider <span class="math">4Dh(x_0) / (t(x_0) - 2)^2</span> as a polynomial <span class="math">h&#x27;(x)</span> for certain <span class="math">x_0</span>. This means for a specific <span class="math">x_0</span>, <span class="math">4Dh(x_0)</span> divides <span class="math">[t(x_0) - 2]^2</span> and it can be represented in polynomial fields as a polynomial <span class="math">h&#x27;(x)</span>. Then equation (19) can be represented as</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">V^2(x_0) = \\left\\{ \\left[ t(x_0) - 2 \\right]^2 / D^2 \\right\\} \\left\\{ h&#x27;(x)r(x) - D \\right\\} \\tag{20}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Thus if <span class="math">h&#x27;(x)r(x) - D</span> can be viewed as a square polynomial <span class="math">S^2(x)</span>, in equation (20) all parameters have square forms. If <span class="math">h&#x27;(x)r(x) - D = S^2(x)</span>, for any suitable <span class="math">x_0</span>, equation (20) is satisfied and can be written as</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">V^2(x_0) = \\left\\{ \\left[ t(x_0) - 2 \\right]^2 / D^2 \\right\\} S^2(x) \\tag{21}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This equation represents a modified polynomial family. For the specific <span class="math">x_0</span>, we have</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">DV^2(x_0) = \\left\\{ \\left[ t(x_0) - 2 \\right]^2 / D \\right\\} S^2(x_0) \\tag{22}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Representing equation (14) into equation (22), we obtain</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">q = \\left[ t^2(x_0) + DV^2(x_0) \\right] / 4 \\tag{23}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We choose <span class="math">x_0</span> as to satisfy that <span class="math">r(x_0)</span> is a prime integer. Then for the specific <span class="math">x_0</span>, if <span class="math">q = \\left[ t^2(x_0) + DV^2(x_0) \\right] / 4</span> is a prime integer, we find all the suitable parameters with satisfaction to a pairing-friendly elliptic curve.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The main idea can be presented as the following procedures. First we choose a specific <span class="math">r(x)</span> and trace polynomial <span class="math">t(x)</span> with <span class="math">r(x) \\mid \\Phi_k(t(x) - 1)</span>. Then after choosing a suitable discriminant <span class="math">D</span>, we find polynomial families <span class="math">h&#x27;(x)</span> satisfying that <span class="math">h&#x27;(x)r(x) - D = S^2(x)</span> as a square polynomial. In the following steps, we choose a suitable <span class="math">x_0</span> with <span class="math">r(x_0)</span> is a prime integer and test whether <span class="math">q = \\{t^2(x_0) + [(t(x_0) - 2)^2 / D]S(x_0)\\} / 4</span> is also a prime integer. Is <span class="math">q</span> according to the conditions, we have found the suitable parameters of a pairing-friendly elliptic curve. In the procedure, <span class="math">4Dh(x_0) / (t(x_0) - 2)^2 = h&#x27;(x)</span>, <span class="math">D \\mid 4h(x_0)</span> and <span class="math">D \\mid [t(x_0) - 2]^2</span> are three hidden conditions since we represent <span class="math">h&#x27;(x)</span> as a polynomial.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The main step in the new method is to find a suitable discriminant <span class="math">D</span> and special polynomial families <span class="math">h&#x27;(x), r(x), S(x)</span> with <span class="math">h&#x27;(x)r(x) - D = S^2(x)</span>. The other work to test prime <span class="math">r(x_0)</span> and <span class="math">q(x_0)</span> is trivial. When <span class="math">r(x)</span> is taken as a standard cyclotomic polynomial, finding suitable <span class="math">S(x)</span> is equal to find the polynomial representations of <span class="math">(-D)^{1/2}</span> in cyclotomic fields. This is because</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">S^{2}(x) + D \\equiv 0 \\mod r(x) \\tag{24}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In such circumstances, our method is same with the methods proposed by Brezing and Weng [7] since equation (24) can be rewritten as</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">DV^{2}(x) = \\{[t(x) - 2]^{2} / D\\} S^{2}(x) \\tag{25}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">S(x)</span> is the representation of <span class="math">(-D)^{1/2}</span> in cyclotomic fields. This equation is same as the main relation proposed in [7]. Thus the work of Brezing et al. is a special case of our new method since in their method <span class="math">r(x)</span> is only taken as a standard cyclotomic polynomial. Our proposed method ignores the restrictions imposed on the form of <span class="math">r(x)</span>. By our method more pairing-friendly elliptic curves are found by various forms of <span class="math">r(x)</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Based on the above analysis, we propose a new algorithm for finding the suitable pairing-friendly elliptic curves.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Brezing et al. [7] and Murphy et al.

In fact, such techniques can not obtain elliptic curves with smaller values of  <span class="math">\\rho</span> . First we analyze the situation when  <span class="math">k</span>  is an even number. When  <span class="math">r(x)</span>  is taken as  <span class="math">\\varPhi_{ik}(x)</span> , we have degree  <span class="math">(r(x)) = \\text{degree}(\\varPhi_{ik}(x)) = i \\times \\text{degree}(\\varPhi_k(x))</span> ; meanwhile, we have  <span class="math">i \\times \\text{degree}(t(x))</span>  and  <span class="math">i \\times \\text{degree}(h&#x27;(x))</span> . Thus the value of  <span class="math">\\rho</span>  is not related to the choice of cyclotomic polynomials since the degrees of  <span class="math">r(x)</span> ,  <span class="math">t(x)</span>  and  <span class="math">h&#x27;(x)</span>  are increased with same multiples.

They took  <span class="math">r(x)</span>  as  <span class="math">\\varPhi_{48}(x)</span>  and  <span class="math">t(x)</span>  as  <span class="math">x^2 + 1</span> . In Table 3, we tabulate some polynomial families when  <span class="math">k = 24</span>  which illustrates that  <span class="math">\\rho \\approx 1.25</span>  is also obtained for  <span class="math">k = 24</span>  when  <span class="math">t(x) = x + 1</span> ,  <span class="math">r(x) = \\varPhi_{24}(x)</span> . These polynomial families prove that the value of  <span class="math">\\rho</span>  has no relation with the choice of the degrees of  <span class="math">\\varPhi_k(x)</span>  and  <span class="math">t(x)</span> .</p>

The only difference is that  <span class="math">x</span>  in  <span class="math">\\varPhi_k(x)</span>  will be represented as  <span class="math">x^s</span>  in  <span class="math">\\varPhi_{sk}(x)</span> . Meanwhile,  <span class="math">h&#x27;(x)</span>  will also have the same property. Thus if we find a special polynomial family for embedding degree  <span class="math">k</span> , we can easily obtain the families with the same forms for embedding degree  <span class="math">sk</span>  ( <span class="math">s = 2^i</span> ). The only work is to represent  <span class="math">x</span>  as  <span class="math">x^s</span> , where  <span class="math">s</span>  is a positive integer power of 2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The beauty of this property is to find curves with larger embedding degree  <span class="math">k</span>  with smaller  <span class="math">\\rho</span> . It is because  <span class="math">\\rho = 1 + [2\\text{degree}(t(x)) + \\text{degree}(h&#x27;(x))] / \\text{degree}(r(x))</span> . When degree of  <span class="math">r(x)</span>  is increased with same multiples of  <span class="math">h&#x27;(x)</span> , if the degree of  <span class="math">t(x)</span>  is not changed, the value of  <span class="math">\\rho</span>  will be decreased. When  <span class="math">h&#x27;(x)</span>  is a constant integer, the situations are more easily to analyze. Since if we always choose  <span class="math">t(x)</span>  as  <span class="math">x + 1</span> , the values of  <span class="math">\\rho</span>  equals  <span class="math">1 + [2 / \\text{degree}(r(x))]</span> . By choosing larger values of embedding degree  <span class="math">k</span> , the degree of  <span class="math">r(x)</span>  will increase, then the value of  <span class="math">\\rho</span>  will be decreased (but it can not reach 1 for ever).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Koblitz and Menezes [18] have suggested to find pairing-friendly elliptic curves</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">with  <span class="math">k = 2^i 3^j</span>  as large as possible. In Table 4, we tabulate the polynomial families when  <span class="math">k = 12, 24, 48, 96</span> . The value of  <span class="math">\\rho</span>  is decreased close to 1 when taking larger values of  <span class="math">k</span> . Since in these families the value of  <span class="math">h</span>  is always 4, the small values of  <span class="math">\\rho</span>  is obtained when  <span class="math">k = 96</span> . When  <span class="math">k = 48</span> , we construct the parameters of certain paring-friendly elliptic curves with  <span class="math">\\rho \\approx 1.125</span> . When  <span class="math">k = 96</span> , we construct the parameters of certain paring-friendly elliptic curves with  <span class="math">\\rho \\approx 1.06</span> . These curves have better performance compared to previous works, since they have smaller values of  <span class="math">\\rho</span>  for larger values of  <span class="math">k</span> . The results are presented in Appendix (b).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With this technique we could find any pairing-friendly elliptic curves with arbitrary embedding degree  <span class="math">k</span> , e.g. finding curves with larger  <span class="math">k</span>  than 96 is not a hard task. But since the suitable values of  <span class="math">x</span>  become sparse when  <span class="math">k</span>  is increased, finding parameters of elliptic curves with the essential security level ( <span class="math">r</span>  is a 160 bits prime) [9] is more difficult with large  <span class="math">k</span> . This is the reason we find the parameters of an elliptic curve with  <span class="math">r</span>  as a 416 bits prime integer when  <span class="math">k = 96</span> . In addition, it is still not aware how large the embedding degree  <span class="math">k</span>  should be for a pairing-friendly curve with best performance. (To find curves with prime  <span class="math">r</span>  close to 160 bits integer for larger values of  <span class="math">k</span> , e.g.  <span class="math">k = 96</span> , we should use some other techniques. This question will be further discussed in section 4.4.)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Brezing and Weng [7] had successfully found pairing-friendly elliptic curves with arbitrary embedding degree. But the limitation of their work was that  <span class="math">r(x)</span>  was only represented as the standard cyclotomic polynomial. It was because their method was to derive kth roots of unity and polynomial representations of  <span class="math">(-D)^{1/2}</span>  in the cyclotomic fields. They did not provide any explanations to the circumstances when  <span class="math">r(x)</span>  was taken as an arbitrary irreducible polynomial. The work of Murphy and Fitzpatrick [4] was also based on the standard representations of  <span class="math">r(x)</span>  as  <span class="math">\\varPhi_k(x)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our method ignores the limitation imposed on the forms of  <span class="math">r(x)</span>  since we only need to find  <span class="math">h&#x27;(x)</span>  and  <span class="math">D</span>  with  <span class="math">h&#x27;(x)r(x) - D = S^2(x)</span> . For this point,  <span class="math">r(x)</span>  can be any irreducible polynomials satisfying  <span class="math">r(x) \\mid \\Phi_k(t(x) - 1)</span> . This allows us to find much more elliptic curves by various representations of  <span class="math">r(x)</span> . In Table 5 we tabulate more special polynomial families with different  <span class="math">r(x)</span>  when  <span class="math">k = 12, 14</span>  and 28. The trace  <span class="math">t(x)</span>  is taken</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">with degree as small as possible to obtain desired values of  <span class="math">\\rho</span> . In Appendix (c) we generate certain parameters of pairing-friendly elliptic curves by the polynomial families listed in Table 5.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In fact, when it is allowed that  <span class="math">r</span>  contains a small factor  <span class="math">s</span>  as  <span class="math">r = sn</span>  ( <span class="math">n</span>  is a prime larger than  <span class="math">2^{160}</span> ), much more suitable elliptic curves are found. The same technique has been used in [1]. When  <span class="math">r = s \\times n</span> ,  <span class="math">n</span>  should be a large prime bigger than  <span class="math">2^{160}</span>  [9] and cofactor  <span class="math">h</span>  will be multiplied with the small factor  <span class="math">s</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper, we propose a new method to find more pairing-friendly elliptic curves with arbitrary embedding degree <span class="math">k</span> by certain special polynomial families. This method allows us to obtain new families of pairing-friendly elliptic curves by representing <span class="math">r(x)</span> with various forms. In addition, we propose a new technique to let prime <span class="math">r</span> contain a small factor <span class="math">s</span>. Numerous parameters of new pairing-friendly elliptic curves are found with the proposed method. These curves have higher security (<span class="math">k \\geq 48</span>) and more efficiency (<span class="math">\\rho \\leq 1.2</span>) compared to the previous work for pairing-based cryptosystems.</p>

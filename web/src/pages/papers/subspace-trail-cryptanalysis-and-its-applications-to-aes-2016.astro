    <p class="text-gray-300">Abstract. We introduce subspace trail cryptanalysis, a generalization of invariant subspace cryptanalysis. With this more generic treatment of subspaces we do no longer rely on specific choices of round constants or subkeys, and the resulting method is as such a potentially more powerful attack vector. Interestingly, subspace trail cryptanalysis in fact includes techniques based on impossible or truncated differentials and integrals as special cases.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Choosing AES-128 as the perhaps most studied cipher, we describe distinguishers up to 5-round AES with a single unknown key. We report (and practically verify) competitive key-recovery attacks with very low data-complexity on 2, 3 and 4 rounds of AES. Additionally, we consider AES with a secret S-Box and we present a (generic) technique that allows to directly recover the secret key without finding any information about the secret S-Box. This approach allows us to use e.g. truncated differential, impossible differential and integral attacks to find the secret key. Moreover, this technique works also for other AES-like constructions, if some very common conditions on the S-Box and on the MixColumns matrix (or its inverse) hold. As a consequence, such attacks allow to better highlight the security impact of linear mappings inside an AES-like block cipher.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, we show that our impossible differential attack on 5 rounds of AES with secret S-Box can be turned into a distinguisher for AES in the same setting as the one recently proposed by Sun, Liu, Guo, Qu and Rijmen at CRYPTO 2016.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If a cryptographic primitive succumbs to a particular non-random behavior, it might be possible to distinguish it from what one would expect from sufficiently generic behavior. Invariant subspace cryptanalysis is a cryptanalytic technique that is powerful for certain block ciphers. If there exists an invariant subspace for the round function and for the key schedule, then this technique can be used to mount fast distinguishers and key recovery. This technique was introduced in <em>[x11]</em> at CRYPTO 2011 for the cryptanalysis of PRINTcipher. Its efficiency has also been demonstrated on the CAESAR candidate iSCREAM, on the LS-design Robin and on the lightweight cipher Zorro in <em>[x15]</em>, and on the block cipher Midori64 <em>[GJN^{+}15]</em>. However, if such symmetries do not exist or are not found, invariant subspace cryptanalysis is not applicable. This leads to the natural question: Can subspace properties still be used, even if no special symmetries or constants allow for invariant subspaces? This paper will answer this question in the affirmative.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-9" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1.1 High-Level Overview of Subspace-Trail Technique</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our main contribution is the analysis of subspaces in SPNs (Substitution-Permutation Networks) constructions with a technique that can be seen as a generalization of invariant subspace attacks <em>[x11, x15]</em>. While invariant subspace cryptanalysis relies on iterative subspace structures, our analysis is concerned with trails of different subspaces. To use an analogy, if invariant subspaces would correspond to iterative differential characteristics, then our method would be “subspace-counterpart” of differential characteristics.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In particular, we study the propagation of subspaces trough various building blocks like S-Boxes and linear layers. In that sense it has similarities with SASAS cryptanalysis <em>[x5]</em>, but also with Evertse’s linear structures <em>[x6]</em>, while another way to generalize invariant subspaces - called “nonlinear invariant attack” - has recently been introduced in <em>[x16]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper we investigate the behavior of subspaces in keyed permutations. At a high level, we fix subspaces of the plaintext that maintain predictable properties after repeated applications of a key-dependent round function. First we identify what we call subspace trails which is essentially a coset of a plaintext subspace that encrypts to proper subspaces of the state space over several rounds. The trails are formed by the affine hulls of the intermediate ciphertexts. Subspace trails typically consist of subspaces that increase in dimension for each round, meaning that if the plaintext subspace has low dimension in comparison to the block length, the subsequent subspaces dimension increases for each round. For byte-based ciphers (like AES), a quick and dirty test for subspaces is to compute the affine hulls of a <span class="math">n</span>-round encryption (for a certain <span class="math">n\\geq 1</span>) of all values for each byte and then identify these subspaces. For bit-based ciphers, it is more important to determine what was coined a nucleon in <em>[x15]</em>, that is candidate plaintext subspaces that seem to fit symmetries in the round function. Trails of affine hulls of the intermediate ciphertexts that grow slowly in dimension for each round, typically reflect slow diffusion in the round function. This is often the case for ciphers that iterate simple round functions many times. In this paper we will focus on what we call constant dimensional subspace trails, which are trails of cosets that preserve dimension over several rounds. We show how to connect two or more trails and form longer trails that preserve predictable structure. In particular, when we connect two trails we typically seek to describe an output coset of a first trail in terms of cosets of the input coset for the second trail.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To make the presentation more concrete, we focus on AES-128. The Rijndael block cipher <em>[x7]</em> has been designed by Daemen and Rijmen in 1997 and accepted as the AES</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">1Note that since we don't look for subspaces trails that are restricted to be invariant, the algorithm provided in [LMR15] is not suitable for finding subspace trails.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(Advanced Encryption Standard) since 2000 by NIST. Nowadays, it is probably the most used block cipher.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-10" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1.2 Contributions</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">There are four types of contributions in this paper. Firstly the definition and description of the subspace trails technique. As first examples, we describe it’s application to secret-key distinguishers for up to 4 rounds of AES. In more details, the approach to the generalization of invariant subspace cryptanalysis to subspace trails is outlined in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3 we give technical preliminaries with respect to AES-like permutations, and in Sect. 3.3 we state central theorems related to subspace trails and their intersections. When concretely applying it to AES, we describe in Sect. 4 distinguishers of round-reduced AES with a single unknown key up to 4 rounds. They correspond to known truncated differential, impossible differential, and integral distinguishers. From this it will become clear that these properties can be seen as special cases of subspace trails.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Secondly, in App. E we describe new low data-complexity key-recovery attacks on AES up to 4 rounds, based on a combination of a truncated differential property (i.e. a relation among pairs of texts) and of properties of individual texts, which follows naturally from the proposed subspace trail approach.The relationship between these attacks and truncated differential cryptanalysis is discussed in App. E.3.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Thirdly, in Sect. 5 and 7 we describe a new and generic technique that can be used to attack AES with a secret S-Box. Even if we do not improve the current best results in this model by Tiesen et al. <em>[x21]</em>, our technique allows (for the first time) to discover the secret key directly, without necessarily finding any equivalent representation or any other information about the S-Box. We show how not only integral attacks, but also truncated differential attacks and impossible differential attacks can exploit this technique. This technique can also be used to attack other AES-like block ciphers, if some very common conditions on the S-Box and on the MixColumns matrix (or its inverse) are guaranteed.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, starting from the impossible differential attack on 5 rounds of AES with a secret S-Box, in Sect. 8 we describe a new 5-round secret-key distinguisher for AES in the same setting as the one presented in <em>[SLG^{+}16]</em>. A critically discussion of that particular distinguisher setting is proposed in Sect. 8.2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Before starting with these detailed sections, we survey our concrete results: the distinguishers in the unknown (secret)-key model, and the key-recovery attacks in the cases of known and secret S-Box, and in both cases we compare them with earlier work.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-11" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1.3 Secret-Key Distinguishers for AES</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The aim of a distinguishing attack is to find some properties of a cipher that random permutations don’t have such that it is possible to distinguish a cipher from random permutations. In the usual security model, the adversary is given a black box (oracle) access to an instance of the encryption function associated with a random secret key and its inverse. The goal is to find the key or more generally to efficiently distinguish the encryption function from a random permutation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Table 1 we summarize the secret-key distinguishers for 1 up to 5 rounds. Such results often serve as a basis for key recovery attacks in the most relevant single-key setting. The subspace trail cryptanalysis includes as special cases of differential cryptanalysis techniques (like truncated or impossible differentials) and integral cryptanalysis, hence the complexities for distinguishers up to 4 rounds is the same.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The first distinguisher for five rounds of AES-128 has been proposed recently in CRYPTO 2016 <em>[SLG^{+}16]</em>. However, this distinguisher requires the whole input-output space to work, or less than the full codebooks if some knowledge of subkey bytes is assumed.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 1: AES secret-key distinguishers, working independent of key schedule. Data complexity is measured in minimum number of chosen plaintexts CP or/and chosen ciphertexts CC which are needed to distinguish the AES permutation from a random permutation with probability higher than  <span class="math">95\\%</span> . The case in which the final MixColumns operation is omitted is denoted by "r.5 rounds", that is  <span class="math">r</span>  full rounds and the final round.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the same setting of this distinguisher, in Sect. 8 we propose our secret key distinguisher for five rounds of AES, which requires (much) less than the whole input-output space without any knowledge about subkeys. Since we derive this distinguisher in a natural way from the impossible differential attack on five rounds of AES with a secret S-Box, we introduce it in Sect. 1.6 together with the mentioned attack, and we focus for the moment only on the distinguishers up to four rounds.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Relation to other Distinguishers. The 1-, 2- and 3-round distinguishers presented in Sect. 4.1 and 4.3 exploit the same well-known structural properties that also truncated differentials exhibit. Using a different notation (namely the AES "Super S-Box"), 2-round subspace trails were already discovered and investigated in [DR06a] and [DR06b], with the objective to understand how the components of the AES interact. In these papers, authors study the probability of differentials and characteristics over 2 rounds of AES, giving bound on the maximum differential probability.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In [DKR97], Daemen et al. proposed a new method that can break more rounds of SQUARE than differential and linear cryptanalysis, which is named the SQUARE attack consequently. In [KW02], Knudsen and Wagner proposed the integral cryptanalysis as a generalized case of such attacks. The first key-recovery attacks on round-reduced AES were obtained by exploiting a 3-round integral distinguisher to attack up to 6 rounds. A re-interpretation of this integral distinguisher (also commonly labeled as square distinguisher) using the subspace trail notation is proposed in Sect. 4.4.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Knudsen [Knu98] and Biham et al. [BBS99] independently proposed the impossible-differential cryptanalysis. This distinguisher exploits differential with probability zero, and it is re-proposed using the subspace trail notation in Sect. 4.4.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The subspace trail approach is mostly providing an alternative description of known properties under the umbrella of a single framework. However, there are other recent techniques that this approach does not seem to include. Recently integral distinguishers have been generalized by Todo [Tod15b] and in there also applied to AES-like primitives. Distinguishers for AES itself were not improved, but clear progress e.g. with MISTY cryptanalysis was demonstrated [Tod15a]. Todo's generalization can take S-Box properties into account, on the other hand the property exploited is still a type of zero-sum. Thus it complements our approach which is independent of the S-Box, but exploits properties more subtle than zero-sums. Subspace trails do not seem to capture other types of distinguisher. Among them are Polytopic distinguishers [Tie16], DS-type distinguishers [DS08a], or non-linear invariants [TLS16].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">1.4 Low Data-Complexity Key-Recovery Attacks on AES</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since practical attacks on block ciphers became extremely rare in the last two decades, the approaches of the cryptanalysis community have been concentrating on attacking reduced-round variants of block ciphers and/or to allow the adversary more degrees of freedom in its control. In the first approach, the usual goal of the adversary is to maximize the number of rounds that can be broken, using less data than the entire codebook and less time than exhaustive key search. Attacks following such an approach are of importance, since they ensure that the block ciphers are strong enough and because they help to establish the security margins offered by the cipher. However, aiming for the highest number of rounds often leads cryptanalyst to attacks very close to brute force ones, or requiring completely impractical amounts of chosen/known inputs up to the full codebook. Practical attacks, especially those focusing on low data complexity, rightfully gained more attention recently, and this is also the focus of the key-recovery part in this paper.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">State of the Art. AES with its wide-trail strategy was designed to withstand differential and linear cryptanalysis <em>[x10]</em>, so pure versions of these techniques have limited applications in attacks. Hence, it is widely believed that no regular differential attack can be mounted on more than 5 rounds of AES (see <em>[PSC^{+}02]</em> for details). For achieving the highest number of rounds, the most effective single-key recovery methods are impossible differential cryptanalysis (which yielded the first attack on the 7-round AES-128 <em>[x27]</em> with non-marginal data complexity) and integral attacks <em>[x9]</em>. Another attack that initially has obtained less attention than the previous ones is the Meet-in-the-Middle attack <em>[x11]</em>, which has potential if enhanced by other techniques/attacks, as the differential attack <em>[x12, x13, x14]</em> or as the bicliques technique <em>[x3]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In works like <em>[BDD^{+}12]</em> authors consider Low-Data Complexity attacks on reduced-rounds of AES, that is they apply attacks assuming the attacker has limited resources, e.g. few plaintext/ciphertext pairs, which is often much more relevant in practice than attacks only aiming at the highest number of rounds. The results of this work have then been improved in <em>[x2]</em>. In that paper, authors set up tools which try to find attacks automatically by searching some classes of Guess-and-Determine and Meet-in-the-Middle attacks. These tools take as input a system of equations that describes the cryptographic primitive and some constraints on the plaintext and ciphertext variables. Then, they first run a search for an “ad hoc” solver for the equations to solve, build it, and then run it to obtain the actual solutions.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Another work in the low-data complexity scenario is the Polytopic Cryptanalysis presented in <em>[x23]</em>, which is a generalization of differential cryptanalysis. In particular, the impossible polytopic cryptanalysis variant (that is, polytopic cryptanalysis that makes use of differentials with probability zero) was shown to allow competitive low-data attacks on round-reduced AES.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-12" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Our Key-Recovery Results</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper, we present key-recovery truncated differential attacks on reduced-round variants of AES-128 based on subspace trail cryptanalysis. A comparison of all known and relevant attacks on AES and our attacks presented in this paper is given in Table 2. To better understand this table, we highlight some aspects. Without going into the details here, AES is a key-iterated block cipher that consists of the repeated application of a round transformation on the state (called intermediate result). Each round transformation is a sequence of four steps. All the rounds are equal, except for the last one which is a slightly different. One of the steps that compose each round (the MixColumns operation) is omitted in the last round.

    <p class="text-gray-300">On the other hand, MitM-style attacks can sometimes work better when all rounds are the same. Since the attacks presented in  <span class="math">\\mathrm{[BDD^{+}12]}</span>  and found by the tool described in [BDF11] mainly exploit the MitM technique, they are sometimes affected by the presence of the final MixColumns, that is the data and the computational complexities are not equal if the final MixColumns is omitted <span class="math">^2</span> . In contrast, note that our attack (based on the truncated differential technique) is independent of the presence of the last MixColumns.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As the data complexity and number of rounds attacked is not always directly comparable, we re-ran the tool from [BDF11] in our settings. As a result, we are able to provide the computational cost of the best attack found by the tool for the case of 3.5 rounds (that is, 4 rounds of AES without the final MixColumns operation) using 2 chosen plaintexts.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our attack on 3 rounds as described in App. E is based on the property that a coset of a particular subspace  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}</span>  of the plaintexts space is always mapped into a coset of another</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">particular subspace <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}</span> after two rounds. Exploiting the particular shape of the subspace <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}</span> and given two ciphertexts (which plaintexts belong to the same coset of <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}</span>), the right key is one of those such that these two ciphertexts belong to the same coset of <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}</span> one round before. We show how to extend this approach in order to attack 4 rounds in App. E.4 by extend our attack at the end, while in App. E.5 we show how to extend it at the beginning.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-13" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1.5 Attack on AES with a Single Secret S-Box</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The subspace trail framework also allows to consider attacks on AES with a <em>single secret</em> S-Box, i.e. the case in which the AES S-Box is replaced by a secret 8-bit one while keeping everything else unchanged. If the choice of the S-Box is made uniformly at random from all 8-bits S-Boxes, the size of the secret information increases from 128-256 bits (i.e. the key size in AES) to 1812-1940. Thus, this could be a good attempt to strengthen the cipher or all to reduce the number of rounds. Note that AES was designed in order to achieve good resistance against differential and linear cryptanalysis, and this includes the choice of the S-Box. However, a randomly chosen S-Box is very highly resistant against these attacks as well.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In <em>[x21]</em>, authors are able to attack up to 6-round of AES with identical and secret S-Box using techniques from integral cryptanalysis. Authors demonstrate that despite the increased size of the secret information in the cipher, they are able to recover both the secret key and the S-Box for the 4-round, 5-round and 6-round versions of AES-128. More precisely, authors are able to find the whitening key up to 256 variants, that is <span class="math">(k_{0},k_{0}\\oplus k_{1},...,k_{0}\\oplus k_{15})</span> (where <span class="math">k_{i}</span> is the <span class="math">i</span>-th byte of the whitening key) for unknown <span class="math">k_{0}</span>. We emphasize that to obtain this result, authors must determine the secret S-Box (up to an additive constant before and after the S-Box, i.e. <span class="math">\\text{S-Box}(x)\\sim a\\oplus\\text{S-Box}(b\\oplus x)</span>) in order to find the key. In other words, using their technique it is not possible to find the key independent of the S-Box. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only work in the literature regarding attacks on AES with a secret S-Box.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, several other results in literature consider (other) encryption schemes with secret part. PRESENT with a secret S-Box has for example been considered in <em>[x1, x16]</em>. One of the first work in this context has been presented by Biryukov and Shamir <em>[x2]</em>, who applied integral cryptanalysis to a generalized SPN structure denoted SASAS, which consists of three substitution layers separated by two affine layers. In their paper, the attacker is assumed not to have any knowledge about the linear layer or the S-boxes which are all allowed to be chosen independently at random. The SASAS attack recovers an equivalent representation of this SPN and thus allows decryption of any ciphertext. The attack allows to break the equivalent of three rounds of AES. A follow up work is <em>[x3]</em>, where authors considered the ASASA scheme in order to design public key or white-box constructions using symmetric cipher components.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In all the previous works, an attacker must work both on the secret S-Box and on the secret key, that is she has to first find information on the secret S-Box in order to discover the secret key. Thus, a natural questions arise: <em>Is it also possible to directly find the secret key without having to discover any information about the secret S-Box?</em> In this paper, we show that it’s possible if some (very common) assumptions are guaranteed. Using the subspace-trail framework, we present a <em>generic</em> technique to discover <em>directly</em> (i.e. without working on the S-Box) the secret key of AES up to some variants, and we show how it is exploited by a truncated differential attack in Sect. 6 (in particular, we consider 3 rounds of AES in App. G.1 and 4 rounds in App. H), by an impossible differential attack in Sect. 7 and by an integral attack in App. G.3.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The assumptions required are that the S-Boxes are identical, that each row of the MixColumns matrix has two identical elements and that each row has these two identical element in different positions. An example is the MixColumns matrix of AES, or any</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">cyclic matrix with two identical elements.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A comparison between this technique and the one presented in [TKKL15] is shown in Table 3. Even if the assumptions are the same (i.e. the assumption of secret and identical S-Box), our goals are different from the one of [TKKL15]. Similar to [TKKL15], using our attack it is only possible to find the whitening key up to  <span class="math">(256)^{4} = 2^{32}</span>  variants, if no information about the S-Box are discovered and used. Anyway, these  <span class="math">2^{32}</span>  variants can be reduced up to 256, working also on the secret S-Box and using a strategy similar to the one of [TKKL15], as shown in detail in App. G.2.1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, we recall the advice given in  <span class="math">\\left[\\mathrm{SLG}^{+}16\\right]</span>  "when design an AES-like cipher, it is better to choose those MDS matrices  <span class="math">M_{MC}</span>  such that both  <span class="math">M_{MC}</span>  and  <span class="math">M_{MC}^{-1}</span>  do not have identical elements in the same columns", which allows to protect the cipher against our attacks presented in this paper and in  <span class="math">\\left[\\mathrm{SLG}^{+}16\\right]</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In  <span class="math">\\left[\\mathrm{SLG}^{+}16\\right]</span> , authors presented the first 5-round secret key distinguisher for AES-128, based on the balanced property.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This distinguisher is constructed in two steps. At first step, authors assume that some of the subkey bits are known. Using this knowledge, they show how to choose the ciphertexts such that the balanced property holds on 5 rounds of AES. This distinguisher requires  <span class="math">2^{120}</span>  texts if the difference of two bytes (i.e. 8 bits) of the subkey is known, or  <span class="math">2^{96}</span>  texts if the differences of four pairs of bytes (i.e. 32 bits) are known. In the second step, authors assume that no secret key material is known. The idea is basically to repeat the first step of the distinguisher for each possible values of the subkey bits used to choose the ciphertexts. For the AES case, when this guess is correct (i.e. when these guessed bits are equal to that of the secret key) the balanced property holds for 5 rounds, which surely occurs in an exhaustive search.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that this distinguisher requires all the input-output space to work, that is the</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">data complexity is <span class="math">2^{128}</span> texts when no subkey byte is known. Moreover, the distinguisher presented in <em>[SLG^{+}16]</em> doesn’t exploit the details of the S-Box (which can be considered secret), that is the ciphertexts are chosen independently of the definition of the S-Box, but it requires some assumptions on the MixColumns matrix (which are the same ones we described for the key recovery attacks on AES with secret S-Box).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As we show in Sect. 8, our impossible differential attack on 5 rounds of AES with a secret S-Box can be turned into a distinguisher in the same setting of the one proposed by <em>[SLG^{+}16]</em>. In our case, we consider an impossible differential trail instead of the balance property. As in the CRYPTO paper, the idea is to check the existence of a key for which the impossible differential trail is satisfied. Note that with respect to a key recovery attack, both our distinguisher and the one presented in the CRYPTO paper have the advantage that it is not necessary to find the entire key to distinguish the two cases, since a limited number of bytes (e.g. the XOR difference of two bytes) is sufficient. Moreover, as in <em>[SLG^{+}16]</em>, our distinguisher is independent by the details of the S-Box operation, but requires the same assumption on the MixColumn matrix <span class="math">M_{MC}</span> (i.e. at least one column must have two identical elements). A critical discussion of these distinguishers is provided in Sect. 8.2, arguing that in some sense the quest for the first 5-round distinguisher is still open despite the recent results.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As maybe the most interesting aspect, this distinguisher provides a counter-example to the conjectures made in <em>[SLG^{+}16]</em>, besides the fact that it doesn’t need the entire input-output space but only <span class="math">2^{98.2}</span> chosen plaintexts. Indeed, the distinguisher presented in <em>[SLG^{+}16]</em> is constructed in the chosen-ciphertext mode, and only in the case in which MixColumns in the last round is not omitted. For this reason, authors claim that “since the 5-round distinguisher for AES can only be constructed in the chosen-ciphertexts mode, the security margin for the round-reduced AES under the chosen-plaintext attack may be different from that under the chosen-ciphertext attack”. However, our distinguisher is constructed in the chosen-plaintexts setting, and it works independent of the last MixColumns operation. Hence it seems there is no clear evidence that chosen-ciphertext security is less than chosen-plaintext security in AES.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Sect. 8.1 we show that also the distinguisher of <em>[SLG^{+}16]</em> can be turned into a key recovery attack, while in Sect. 8.2 we critically discuss the model in which these distinguishers work.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-15" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1.7 Practical Verification</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Almost all results in the paper have been verified using a C/C++ implementation:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We practically verified the secret-key distinguishers for up to 4 rounds, and we have found that the practical results are consistent with our theory. The source codes of the secret-key distinguishers can be found in <em>[x14]</em>. Due to the huge data and computational complexity of the secret-key distinguishers on 5-round AES described in Sect. 8, it can not be verified even on small-scale AES <em>[x10]</em> (more details are given in App. I.1.3). Theoretically considerations are given to prove its correctness. We practically verified the low-data complexity attacks on 1, 2, 3 and 4 rounds. For the 3 rounds attack, one or two pairs of plaintexts (that is two or three different plaintexts) are sufficient to discover the key of the final round, as predicted. Since the attack on 4 rounds described in App. E.4 has a very high computational cost, we have tested it in a different way, which is explained in detail with the presentation of the attack. The source codes of the low-data complexity attacks can be found in <em>[x14]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Key-Recovery Attacks on AES with a Secret S-Box. We practically verified the truncated differential attacks on AES with a secret S-Box on 3 and 4 rounds, and the integral attack on AES with a secret S-Box on 3 rounds. The experimental results are in according to our theory. In particular, considerations about the practical computational costs of these attacks (in comparison with the theoretical ones) are reported in Sect. 6. The source codes of the key-recovery attacks on AES with a single secret S-Box can be found in [git16a].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we recall the invariant subspace cryptanalysis of [LAAZ11, LMR15] (depicted in Fig. 1), and then we introduce the concept of subspace trails (Fig. 2).</p>

Assume there exists a coset  <span class="math">V \\oplus a</span>  such that  <span class="math">F(V \\oplus a) = V \\oplus a&#x27;</span> . Then if the round key  <span class="math">K</span>  resides in  <span class="math">V \\oplus (a \\oplus a&#x27;)</span> , it follows that  <span class="math">F(V \\oplus a) \\oplus K = V \\oplus a</span>  and we get an iterative invariant subspace.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A slightly more powerful property can occur if for each  <span class="math">a</span> , there exists a unique  <span class="math">b</span>  such that  <span class="math">F_{K}(V \\oplus a) := F(V \\oplus a) \\oplus K = V \\oplus b</span>  meaning that the subspace property is invariant, but not the initial coset. That is, for each initial coset  <span class="math">V \\oplus a</span> , its image under the application of  <span class="math">F_{K}</span>  is another coset of  <span class="math">V</span> , in general different from the initial one.

In this paper, we generalize this concept and search for trails of subspaces. In the simplest case we look for pairs of subspaces  <span class="math">V_{1}</span>  and  <span class="math">V_{2}</span>  such that</p>

With subspace structures at hand, we might ask questions about the probability that ciphertexts or sums of ciphertexts reside in certain subspaces, given that the plaintexts obey certain subspace structure (e.g. their sum is also in a fixed subspace). If the sum is over two texts this approaches resembles (truncated) differential cryptanalysis, if the sum is over more it can resemble integral cryptanalysis.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For AES-type block ciphers, we are typically not able to construct very long trails. In this case we can connect trails together and depending on the intersection properties of the endpoints of the trails, get predictable subspace properties for longer trails. However, in general these are not necessarily simple constant dimensional trails. In the following we describe subspace trail cryptanalysis and later-on distinguishers based on it. For sake of concreteness and better exposition, we focus on the case of AES. We’d like to emphasize that the properties described here extend almost immediately to any AES-like cipher with little modifications.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The Advanced Encryption Standard <em>[x10]</em> is a Substitution-Permutation network that supports key size of 128, 192 and 256 bits. The 128-bit plaintext initializes the internal state as a <span class="math">4\\times 4</span> matrix of bytes as values in the finite fields <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{256}</span>, defined using the irreducible polynomial <span class="math">x^{8}+x^{4}+x^{3}+x+1</span>. Depending on the version of AES, <span class="math">N_{r}</span> round are applied to the state: <span class="math">N_{r}=10</span> for AES-128, <span class="math">N_{r}=12</span> for AES-192 and <span class="math">N_{r}=14</span> for AES-256. An AES round applies four operations to the state matrix:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>SubBytes (S-Box) - applying the same 8-bit to 8-bit invertible S-Box 16 times in parallel on each byte of the state (it provides the non-linearity in the cipher);</li>

      <li>ShiftRows (<span class="math">SR</span>) - cyclic shift of each row (<span class="math">i</span>-th row is shifted by <span class="math">i</span> bytes to the left);</li>

      <li>MixColumns (<span class="math">MC</span>) - multiplication of each column by a constant <span class="math">4\\times 4</span> invertible matrix over the field <span class="math">GF(2^{8})</span> (it and ShiftRows provide diffusion in the cipher);</li>

      <li>AddRoundKey (<span class="math">ARK</span>) - XORing the state with a 128-bit subkey.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Subspace Trail Cryptanalysis and its Applications to AES</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One round of AES can be described as  <span class="math">R(x) = K \\oplus MC \\circ SR \\circ \\mathrm{S - Box}(x)</span> .

      <li>if  <span class="math">i \\equiv 0 \\mod 4</span> , then  <span class="math">W[i] = W[i - 4] \\oplus \\text{RotByte}(\\text{S-Box}(W[i - 1])) \\oplus \\text{RCON}[i/4]</span> ,</li>

      <li>otherwise,  <span class="math">W[i] = W[i - 1] \\oplus W[i - 4]</span> ,</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">i = 4, \\dots, 43</span> , RotByte rotates the word by 8 bits to the left and  <span class="math">RCON[\\cdot]</span>  is an array of predetermined constant.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The Notation Used in the Paper. Let  <span class="math">x</span>  denote a plaintext, a ciphertext, an intermediate state or a key.

We denote by  <span class="math">k^r</span>  the key of the  <span class="math">r</span> -th round, where  <span class="math">k^0</span>  is the secret key. If only the key of the final round is used, then we denote it by  <span class="math">k</span>  to simplify the notation. Finally, we denote by  <span class="math">R</span>  one round of AES <span class="math">^6</span> , while we denote  <span class="math">i</span>  rounds of AES by  <span class="math">R^{(i)}</span> . If the MixColumns operation is omitted in the last round, then we denote it by  <span class="math">R_f</span> . As last thing, in the paper we often use the term "partial collision" (or, more simply, collision) when two texts belong to the same coset of a given subspace  <span class="math">X</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is easy to see that SubBytes maps cosets of diagonal and column spaces to cosets of diagonal and column spaces. Since SubBytes operates on each byte individually and it is bijective, and since the bytes of column and diagonal spaces are independent, its only effect is to change the coset. It is also easy to see that ShiftRows maps a coset of a diagonal space to a coset of a column space, since diagonals are mapped to columns, and it maps a coset of a column space to a coset of an inverse-diagonal space. The effect of MixColumns to a column space <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_I \\oplus a</span> is simply to change the coset, since applying the MixColumns matrix to a column space <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_i</span> has no effect.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof. As we have just seen, since SubBytes is bijective and operates on each byte independently, it simply changes the coset  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_I \\oplus a</span>  to  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_I \\oplus a&#x27;</span> , where  <span class="math">a_{i,j}&#x27; = \\mathrm{S - Box}(a_{i,j})</span>  for each  <span class="math">i,j = 0,\\ldots,3</span> . ShiftRows simply moves the bytes of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_I \\oplus a&#x27;</span>  to a column space  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_I \\oplus b&#x27;</span> , where  <span class="math">b&#x27; = SR(a&#x27;)</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof. By definition 5, the mixed spaces  <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_I</span>  are defined as the application of the Mix-Columns operation to inverse-diagonal space  <span class="math">\\mathcal{ID}_I</span> . Since a ShiftRows operation maps a column space to an inverse-diagonal space, a mixed space  <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_I</span>  is equivalently defined as the application of the linear layer in AES to column spaces  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_I</span> . Since the SubBytes layer only moves a coset  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_I \\oplus a</span>  to a coset  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_I \\oplus a&#x27;</span> , it follows that for any fixed coset  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_I \\oplus a</span> , there exists  <span class="math">b \\in \\mathcal{M}_I^\\perp</span>  such that  <span class="math">MC \\circ SR \\circ \\mathrm{S - Box}(\\mathcal{C}_I \\oplus a) \\oplus K = \\mathcal{M}_I \\oplus b</span> , where  <span class="math">b = MC \\circ SR(a&#x27;) \\oplus K</span>  and  <span class="math">a_{i,j}&#x27; = \\mathrm{S - Box}(a_{i,j})</span>  for each  <span class="math">i, j = 0, \\dots, 3</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Similarly to before, this simply states that a coset of a sum of column spaces  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_I</span>  encrypts to a coset of the corresponding sum of mixed spaces  <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_I</span>  over one round.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We continue with useful properties of AES subspaces. In this section we show the following: diagonal spaces and column spaces have non-trivial intersection, column spaces and mixed spaces have non-trivial intersection, but diagonal spaces and mixed spaces have only trivial intersection.

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we describe a series of subspace trails for AES. Additionally we also describe how these trails can be used to formulate ways to detect non-randomness, often colloquially referred to a distinguishers. All distinguishers in this section, ranging from two up to four rounds, are independent of the round keys and are formulated without the knowledge of the key. From now on, we assume that any subspaces <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_{I}</span>, <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{I}</span> or <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_{I}</span> has nonzero dimension (that is, <span class="math">I\\subseteq\\{0,1,2,3\\}</span> is not empty). Moreover, when we intersect two subspaces <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_{I}</span> and <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_{J}</span>, where both <span class="math">I</span> and <span class="math">J</span> are assumed non-empty, we always assume that the sum of their dimensions is not larger than 16.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Thus, one pair of plaintexts (that is two texts) is sufficient to distinguish the random case from the other one. Indeed, on average in the random case we expect  <span class="math">2^{-94} \\cdot 2 = 2^{-93} \\simeq 0</span>  collisions (a "collision" occurs when two elements belong to the same coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_I</span> ), while this number is always equal to 1 in the other case. The cost of this distinguisher is hence two texts. An equivalent distinguisher over 2 rounds was already introduced in [DR06b], where authors investigated how the components of the AES interact over 2 rounds.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, note that a similar distinguisher can be used for the 1 round case. Indeed, note that if two plaintexts belong to the same coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_I</span>  (equivalently  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_I</span> ), then they belong to the same coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_I</span>  (equivalently  <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_I</span> ) with probability 1 for each  <span class="math">I</span>  after 1 round. Moreover, observe that it also is possible to set up a 2 rounds distinguisher using the impossible differential properties defined in (2) or (3).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Lorenzo Grassi ^{1} , Christian Rechberger ^{1,3} and Sondre Rønjom ^{2,4}</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Before to go on, we highlight that in App. E we present new key-recovery attacks for 3- and 4-round of AES that exploit the 2-round subspace trail of AES just presented.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For 3 rounds, the idea is simply to exploit the fact that two elements in the same coset of a diagonal space  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_I</span>  belong to the same coset of a mixed space  <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_I</span>  after 2 rounds - see Prob. (1). Thus, given two plaintexts  <span class="math">p^1</span>  and  <span class="math">p^2</span>  in the same coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_I</span>  (that is  <span class="math">p^1 \\oplus p^2 \\in \\mathcal{D}_I</span> ) and the corresponding ciphertexts  <span class="math">c^1</span>  and  <span class="math">c^2</span>  after 3 rounds, the final key  <span class="math">k</span>  must satisfy the following relationship:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">R _ {k} ^ {- 1} (c ^ {1}) \\oplus R _ {k} ^ {- 1} (c ^ {2}) \\in \\mathcal {M} _ {I}.</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In order to find the secret key and to minimize the data and the computational costs, these attacks exploit the shape of the mixed space  <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_I</span> , that is the facts that the columns of a coset of a mixed space  <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_I</span>  depend on different and independent variables and the relationships that hold among the bytes of the same column of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_I</span> . The attacks on 4 rounds are obtained extending at the end or at the beginning this attack on 3 rounds.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As highlight in App. E.3, these attacks are truncated differential in nature, and are competitive with the other low-data complexity attacks present in literature, as the ones proposed in [BDF11] and  <span class="math">\\mathrm{[BDD^{+}12]}</span> . We refer to App. E for a detailed analysis.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">There are several techniques that can be used to set up a 3-round distinguisher for AES, as for example (1) truncated differential, (2) balance property and (3) impossible differential. In this section, we only describe the truncated differential distinguisher using the subspace trail, which we'll be used to set up the attack on 4-round of AES with secret S-Box. The other two distinguishers based on the balance property and on the impossible differential are presented in details using the subspace trail in the next section. Note that the arguments in next section used for 4 rounds of AES holds also for the 3-round case.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The most competitive distinguisher on 3-round of AES is based on truncated differential trails, and an example of it is depicted in Fig. 5. In the following, we re-interpret it using the subspace trail.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">!<a href="img-4.jpeg">img-4.jpeg</a> Figure 5: Truncated differential characteristic over 3-round AES. White box denotes a byte with a zero difference, while black box denotes a byte with a non-zero difference.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Consider a coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_I</span>  as starting point. After two rounds, this coset is mapped into a coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_I</span>  with probability 1. Indeed, as we have seen in Lemma 1, a coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_I</span>  is mapped into a coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_I</span>  with probability 1 after one round, and, as we have seen in Lemma 2, a coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_I</span>  is mapped into a coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_I</span>  with probability 1 after one round. Thus, if we consider two elements that belong to the same cosets of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_I</span> , after two rounds they belong in the same coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_I</span>  for sure. However, at the same time and with a certain probability, it is possible that these two elements belong to the same coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_J \\cap \\mathcal{M}_I \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}_J</span>  for a certain  <span class="math">J</span>  after two rounds.

    <p class="text-gray-300">To do this, we recall the birthday paradox. Given <span class="math">d</span> (equally likely) values and <span class="math">n</span> variables, the probability that at least two of them have the same value is given by:</p>

However, this property holds if we choose any of the four 12-dimensional space <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_{J}</span> as a target distinguisher space, each yielding an independent experiment. Since this experiments are independent, we have that the probability to have at least one collision in the subspace case given <span class="math">m</span> texts is:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Exactly as before, the idea is to look for the minimum number of texts  <span class="math">m</span>  in order to guarantee at least one collision in the random case with high probability. Since there are four 12-dimensional space  <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_J</span>  and using the birthday paradox, the probability to have at least one collision in the random case given  <span class="math">m</span>  texts is well approximated by  <span class="math">p = 1 - e^{-m(m - 1) / (2\\cdot 2^{30})}</span> . Thus,  <span class="math">m\\simeq 2^{16.25}</span>  texts are sufficient to set up a 4-round distinguisher (in this case, the probability to have a collision in the random case is approximately  <span class="math">95\\%</span>  - note that  <span class="math">2^{15.75}</span>  texts are sufficient to have at least one collision with probability of  <span class="math">75\\%</span> ).

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, starting from this 4-round impossible subspace trail, it is possible to re-define the impossible differential attack in a very natural way. We highlight this relationship in App. D, giving all the details.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">From now on, we focus on AES with a single secret S-Box, and we show how to exploit subspace trails in order to set up key-recovery attacks. More precisely, assume to consider AES with secret and identical (bijective) S-Box. Here we present a generic strategy related to the presented subspace trail that can be used to recover directly the secret key (that is, without finding any information or equivalent representation of the secret S-Box). In particular, in the following we show how truncated differential, impossible differential, and square attacks can exploit this strategy to attack 3- up to 5-round of AES.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The main idea of our attack on AES with a secret S-Box is the following. As we have seen, a coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_i</span>  is mapped into a coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_i</span>  after one round. Using some particular (but very common) properties of the MixColumns matrix, it is possible to choose a subset of a coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_i</span>  which depends on the secret key, such that it is mapped after one round into a subset of a coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_J \\cap \\mathcal{C}_i \\subseteq \\mathcal{D}_J</span>  with probability 1. That is, consider a subset of a coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_i</span>  which depends on the guessed values of some bytes of the secret key. If these guessed values are wrong, then after one round this subset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_i</span>  is mapped into a subset of a coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_i</span> . Instead, if these guessed values are correct, then after one round this subset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_i</span>  is mapped into a subset of a coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_J</span>  with probability 1. Note that also when the guessed values are wrong it is possible that the initial subset is mapped into a subset of a</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Subspace Trail Cryptanalysis and its Applications to AES</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_J</span>  after one round, but this happens with probability strictly less than 1. Using this property together with other considerations, the attacker can identify the right key.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This attack exploits some particular (but very common) properties of the MixColumns matrix  <span class="math">M_{MC}</span> . However, before to list these properties of  <span class="math">M_{MC}</span>  used for the attack, we define the concepts of (two) consecutive-row bytes and of (two) consecutive-diagonal bytes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Definition 7. Let  <span class="math">t \\in \\mathbb{F}_{2^k}^{4 \\times 4}</span>  a text. Given two different bytes  <span class="math">t_{i,j}</span>  and  <span class="math">t_{l,k}</span>  (where the indexes are taken modulo 4):</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>if they lie in the same row, they are "consecutive-row bytes" if  <span class="math">i = l</span> , and if  <span class="math">j + 1 = k</span>  for  <span class="math">j &amp;lt; k \\leq 3</span>  or  <span class="math">k + 1 = j</span>  otherwise;</li>

      <li>if they lie in the same diagonal, they are "consecutive-diagonal bytes" if  <span class="math">i + 1 = l</span>  for  <span class="math">i &amp;lt; l \\leq 3</span>  or  <span class="math">l + 1 = i</span>  otherwise, and if  <span class="math">j + 1 = k</span>  for  <span class="math">j &amp;lt; k \\leq 3</span>  or  <span class="math">k + 1 = j</span>  otherwise.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Examples of two consecutive-row bytes are  <span class="math">(t_{0,0}, t_{0,1})</span>  or  <span class="math">(t_{0,0}, t_{0,3})</span> , while examples of two consecutive-diagonal bytes are  <span class="math">(t_{0,0}, t_{1,1})</span>  or  <span class="math">(t_{0,0}, t_{3,3})</span> . Using this definition, the two properties of the MixColumns matrix  <span class="math">M_{MC}</span>  that we are going to use are:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>each row of  <span class="math">M_{MC}</span>  has two identical consecutive-row bytes;</li>

      <li>each row of  <span class="math">M_{MC}</span>  has these two identical consecutive-row bytes in different positions, that is two different rows can not have the two identical consecutive-row bytes in the same columns.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that a cyclic matrix with two identical elements for each row satisfies these conditions. Moreover, these conditions can be a little generalized, since for example it is not necessary that the two identical byte are consecutive.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using this properties of  <span class="math">M_{MC}</span> , our attack is based on the following proposition.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proposition 2. Let  <span class="math">p^1</span>  and  <span class="math">p^2</span>  two texts such that  <span class="math">p_{i,j}^1 = p_{i,j}^2</span>  for each  <span class="math">(i,j) \\neq \\{(0,0),(1,1)\\}</span>  and  <span class="math">p_{0,0}^1 \\oplus p_{1,1}^1 = p_{0,0}^2 \\oplus p_{1,1}^2</span> . If  <span class="math">p_{0,0}^1 \\oplus p_{1,1}^1 = p_{0,0}^2 \\oplus p_{1,1}^2 = k_{0,0} \\oplus k_{1,1}</span>  (where  <span class="math">k</span>  is the secret key of the first round), then after one round they belong to the same coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_0 \\cap \\mathcal{D}_{0,1,3} \\subseteq \\mathcal{D}_{0,1,3}</span> , that is  <span class="math">R(p^1) \\oplus R(p^2) \\in \\mathcal{C}_0 \\cap \\mathcal{D}_{0,1,3} \\subseteq \\mathcal{D}_{0,1,3}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof. First of all, note that these two texts  <span class="math">p^1</span>  and  <span class="math">p^2</span>  belong in the same coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_0 \\cap \\mathcal{C}_{0,1} \\subseteq \\mathcal{D}_0</span>  (by definition of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_0</span> ). As we have already seen, if two elements belong to the same coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_0</span> , then after one round they belong to the same coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_0</span> . Thus, it is sufficient to prove that  <span class="math">R(p^1) \\oplus R(p^2) \\in \\mathcal{D}_{0,1,3}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since  <span class="math">R(p^1) \\oplus R(p^2) \\in \\mathcal{C}_0</span> , in order to prove that  <span class="math">R(p^1) \\oplus R(p^2) \\in \\mathcal{D}_{0,1,3}</span>  it is sufficient to prove that  <span class="math">R(p^1)_{2,0} \\oplus R(p^2)_{2,0} = 0</span> . By simple computation:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\begin{array}{l} R (p ^ {1}) _ {2, 0} = \\mathrm {S - B o x} (p _ {0, 0} ^ {1} \\oplus k _ {0, 0} ^ {0}) \\oplus \\mathrm {S - B o x} (p _ {1, 1} ^ {1} \\oplus k _ {1, 1} ^ {0}) \\oplus \\\\ \\oplus \\alpha \\cdot \\mathrm {S - B o x} (p _ {2, 2} ^ {1} \\oplus k _ {2, 2}) \\oplus (\\alpha + 1) \\cdot \\mathrm {S - B o x} (p _ {3, 3} ^ {1} \\oplus k _ {3, 3}). \\\\ \\end{array}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">First of all observe that  <span class="math">\\mathrm{S - Box}(p_{0,0}^{1}\\oplus k_{0,0}^{0})\\oplus \\mathrm{S - Box}(p_{1,1}^{1}\\oplus k_{1,1}^{0}) = 0</span> . Indeed, since  <span class="math">p_{0,0}^{1}\\oplus p_{1,1}^{1} = k_{0,0}\\oplus k_{1,1}</span>  by definition, then  <span class="math">p_{0,0}^{1}\\oplus k_{0,0}^{0} = p_{1,1}^{1}\\oplus k_{1,1}^{0}</span> , that is  <span class="math">\\mathrm{S - Box}(p_{0,0}^{1}\\oplus k_{0,0}^{0}) = \\mathrm{S - Box}(p_{1,1}^{1}\\oplus k_{1,1}^{0})</span> , or equivalently  <span class="math">\\mathrm{S - Box}(p_{0,0}^{1}\\oplus k_{0,0}^{0})\\oplus \\mathrm{S - Box}(p_{1,1}^{1}\\oplus k_{1,1}^{0}) = 0</span> . Thus:</p>

Moreover, we stress that, with respect to other attacks present in literature in the same setting (i.e. AES with a secret S-Box), for the first time we show that it is possible to discover the secret key directly, that is without discovering any information (e.g. an equivalent class) about the secret S-Box.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-30" class="text-2xl font-bold">6 Truncated Differential Attacks on 3 and 4 Rounds of AES with a Secret S-Box</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we briefly show how to exploit the previous strategy to set up truncated differential attacks on 3- and 4-round of AES with a secret S-Box. We limit here to give the idea of these attacks, and we refer to App. G and H for all the details together with the presentation of the square attack on AES with a secret S-Box (see App. G.3).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Truncated Diff. Attack on 3 rounds of AES with Secret S-Box The attack on 3-rounds - illustrated in Fig. 9 - works as follows. Consider a pair of plaintexts <span class="math">p^{1}</span> and <span class="math">p^{2}</span> with the condition <span class="math">p^{1}_{i,j}=p^{2}_{i,j}</span> for each <span class="math">(i,j)\\neq\\{(0,0),(1,1)\\}</span> and <span class="math">p^{1}_{0,0}\\oplus p^{1}_{1,1}=p^{2}_{0,0}\\oplus p^{2}_{1,1}</span>. As we have seen, if <span class="math">p^{1}_{0,0}\\oplus p^{1}_{1,1}=p^{2}_{0,0}\\oplus p^{2}_{1,1}=k_{0,0}\\oplus k_{1,1}</span>, then <span class="math">p^{1}</span> and <span class="math">p^{2}</span> belong to the same coset of <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_{0,1,3}</span> after one round with probability 1. Consequently, after three rounds they belong to the same coset of <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_{0,1,3}</span> with probability 1 (or of <span class="math">\\mathcal{ID}_{0,1,3}</span> if the final MixColumns is omitted), since a coset of <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_{0,1,3}</span> is mapped into a coset of <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_{0,1,3}</span> with probability 1. Instead, if <span class="math">p^{1}_{0,0}\\oplus p^{1}_{1,1}=p^{2}_{0,0}\\oplus p^{2}_{1,1}\\neq k_{0,0}\\oplus k_{1,1}</span>, then <span class="math">p^{1}</span> and <span class="math">p^{2}</span> belong to the same coset of <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_{0,1,3}</span> after one round only with probability <span class="math">2^{-8}</span> (that is, only if <span class="math">R(p^{1})_{2,0}\\oplus R(p^{2})_{2,0}=0</span>). Thus, after three rounds they belong to the same coset of <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_{0,1,3}</span> only with probability <span class="math">2^{-8}</span>. Our attack exploits these different probabilities in order to find <span class="math">k_{0,0}\\oplus k_{1,1}</span>. More details are given in App. G.1.</p>

The choice of the plaintexts (i.e.  <span class="math">p_{0,0} \\oplus p_{1,1} = k_{0,0} \\oplus k_{1,1}</span> ) guarantees that after one round there are only three bytes with non-zero difference instead of four, that is the plaintexts belong to the same coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_0 \\cap \\mathcal{D}_{0,1,3}</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">Lorenzo Grassi ^{1} , Christian Rechberger ^{1,3} and Sondre Rønjom ^{2,4}</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">the probability that there exists one <span class="math">\\Delta</span> with the previous property is only <span class="math">2^{-120}</span>. This distinguisher works only in the decryption direction (i.e. using chosen ciphertexts) and only if the final MixColumns operation is not omitted. Moreover, there is no evidence that this distinguisher can work with less than the entire input-output space<span class="math">^{12}</span>. We refer to [SLG^{+}16] for more details. To summarize, this distinguisher requires the full codebook (i.e. <span class="math">2^{128}</span> texts), and the verification cost is well approximated by <span class="math">2^{128}</span> XOR operations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For comparison, our distinguisher requires only <span class="math">2^{98.2}</span> different (plaintexts, ciphertexts), works in the encryption direction (i.e. using chosen plaintexts) independently by the presence of the final MixColumns operation. Thus, as we said in the introduction, this provides a counter-example to the claims made in [SLG^{+}16]. That is, as we have already discussed in details in the introduction, this distinguisher provides a counter-example to the conjecture made by these authors that the security margin for round-reduced AES under the chosen plaintext attack is different from that under the chosen-ciphertexts attack.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Only for completeness, we prove that if our distinguisher uses all the input-output space, the probability of success is <span class="math">1 - 2^{-2^{25.5}}</span>. If all the texts are used, then for each <span class="math">\\delta</span> there are <span class="math">2^{112}</span> different sets <span class="math">V_{\\delta}</span>. Thus, it is possible to construct approximately <span class="math">2^{15} \\cdot 2^{112} = 2^{127}</span> different pairs. The probability that for a (wrong) <span class="math">\\delta</span> no one of these pairs satisfy the required property is approximately <span class="math">1 - (1 - 2^{-94})^{2^{127}} \\simeq 1 - e^{-2^{33}} \\simeq 1 - 2^{-2^{55.5}}</span>. Thus, the probability of success is approximately <span class="math">(1 - 2^{-2^{33.5}})^{2^8} \\simeq 1 - 2^{-2^{25.5}}</span> if all the input-output space is used, which is much higher than for the integral distinguisher (which is approximately <span class="math">1 - 2^{-120}</span>). We stress that our distinguisher works even using a less data complexity that the entire input-output space, and that <span class="math">2^{110.5}</span> different (plaintexts, ciphertexts) (or equivalently <span class="math">2^{94.5}</span> different sets <span class="math">V_{\\delta}</span> for each <span class="math">\\delta</span>) are sufficient to have approximately the same probability of success of [SLG^{+}16].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, in [SLG^{+}16] authors exploit the link between zero-correlation linear hulls and the integral property to set up our distinguisher, while our distinguisher presented in this paper exploits the impossible differential trails. For completeness, we recall that Impossible Differential, Integral and Zero-Linear Correlation are not independent, as shown in details in [SLR^{+}15]. In particular, the presence of a zero correlation linear hull distinguisher (very likely) implies the existence of an Impossible Differential distinguisher and of an Integral one.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Turn the CRYPTO Distinguisher into a Key-Recovery Attack. As we have turned our key recovery attack into a distinguisher, it is also possible to turn the distinguisher of [SLG^{+}16] into an attack, as also the authors observed in their paper. The idea is to repeat the distinguisher three times (using the version presented in Corollary 5 of [SLG^{+}16] and reported in the footnote, it is possible to recover four bytes of the key), in order to recover the secret key up to <span class="math">2^{32}</span> variants. Note that also in this case as for our attacks, it is not possible to eliminate more variants of the key without using any information about the secret S-Box. This attack requires the entire input-output space, and it has a cost of <span class="math">3 \\cdot 2^{128} = 2^{129.6}</span> XOR operations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Final Observations. Finally, it is very easy to generalize our distinguisher and the one proposed in [SLG^{+}16] to any AES-like block cipher with the following properties: (1) the encryption scheme adopts identical S-Boxes and (2) at least one row of the MixColumns matrix <span class="math">M_{MC}</span> (or its inverse) contains (at least) two identical elements. If one of these two assumptions is missing, the above distinguishers don't work. As a consequence, note that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\{(p,e)\\mid c_{0,0}\\oplus c_{1,3}=\\delta_{0},c_{0,1}\\oplus c_{3,2}=\\delta_{1},c_{1,2}\\oplus c_{2,1}=\\delta_{2},c_{2,0}\\oplus c_{3,3}=\\delta_{3}\\}</span>, where <span class="math">\\Delta=(\\delta_0,\\ldots,\\delta_3)</span>. Also in this case, for an AES permutation there exists one <span class="math">\\Delta</span> for which the balance property holds among the plaintexts, while for a random permutation this happens only with probability <span class="math">2^{-96}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">^{12}</span>It may be possible to use the recently proposed statistical integral distinguisher [WCC^{+}16] to modify the distinguisher presented in [SLG^{+}16] into a statistical integral one, with the goal to reduce the data complexity at the cost of success probability.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">the distinguisher described in this section can not work in the decryption mode (that is, with chosen ciphertexts instead of chosen plaintexts), since no one of the columns of the inverse MixColumns <span class="math">M_{MC}^{-1}</span> has two equal elements. Actually, the first requirement can be relaxed. Indeed, it is sufficient that only the two S-Boxes that are in the positions in which the MixColumns matrix has identical elements are equal.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that these assumptions are similar but not equal to the ones required for a key recovery attacks. Indeed, for our key recovery attacks on an AES-like block cipher with secret S-Box, all the S-Boxes must be identical and each row of the MixColumns matrix <span class="math">M_{MC}</span> must contain (at least) two identical elements in different positions.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We emphasize that these assumptions are quite common for the construction of AES-like ciphers (or more in general, for SPNs ciphers). Indeed, symmetric encryption schemes are usually a trade-off between the security and computational efficiency. Thus, to enhance the performance of an encryption scheme (especially for lightweight cryptography), designers usually use identical S-Box and a diffusion layer which maximize the number of 1’s (or elements with relatively low hamming weights).</p>

    <h3 id="sec-36" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">8.2 Critical Discussion of the Distinguisher Model and Open Problems</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we have shown how to interpret the 5-round secret S-Box attack from the section before as a distinguisher for 5-round AES which corresponds to the model used in <em>[SLG^{+}16]</em>, with our main point being to give a counter-example to the conjecture motivated by the results therein. By doing that we also significantly improved the complexity of such a distinguisher.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since any key recovery attack can be used as a distinguisher, the natural question that arises is if such a distinguisher is actually meaningful. Both ours and the distinguisher from <em>[SLG^{+}16]</em> have two properties that set them apart from “any” key recovery-attack:</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>for both distinguishers it is sufficient to find <em>only part of the key</em> (e.g. one byte) to distinguish an AES permutation with a secret S-Box from a random one. In other words, it is not necessary finding the entire secret key but only part of it;</li>

      <li>both distinguishers don’t need any information/details about the S-Box (i.e. they don’t find or/and exploit any information/details of the secret S-Box) in order to find part of the key.</li>

    </ol>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In order to better highlight this sub-class of attacks/distinguishers, we denote them by “<em>weak” secret-key distinguishers</em>. In contrast, we refer to (pure) secret-key distinguisher when a property which is independently of the secret key is exploited, and to key-recovery attack when (at least) one of the two previous properties is not satisfied.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We emphasize that all the secret-key distinguishers currently present in literature - and presented in this paper in Sect. 4 - exploit a property which is independent of the key and of the details of the S-Box. In particular, it is not necessary to know the details of the S-Box to check the integral property or verify is two texts belong or not to the same coset of a mixed space <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_{I}</span> (that is, the property exploited by the truncated and the impossible differential distinguishers). This second property is in common with the “weak” secret-key distinguishers just defined. On the opposite, a key-recovery attack (e.g. an integral attack, a truncated differential one, …) usually exploits such details to find the key. As an example, we highlight that also the attacks presented in <em>[x17]</em> on AES with a single secret S-Box don’t satisfy the second requirement (i.e. it exploits the details of the S-Box to find the secret key). Indeed, even if the S-Box is secret, such attacks necessarily need to find/know the details of the S-Box (up to an equivalent class) before to discover the secret key, or in other words they can not discover the secret key without exploiting the details of the secret S-Box. Thus, such attacks can not be considered as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">“weak” secret-key distinguishers with respect to categorization just defined, but falls in the generic category of the key-recovery attacks.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Even if there are key-recovery attacks on up to 7 rounds for AES-128 <em>[x10]</em> with known S-Box, and up to 6 rounds for AES-128 with a secret S-Box <em>[x15]</em>, it seems for example not possible to find a distinguisher with properties (1) and (2) for even 6 rounds.

    <p class="text-gray-300">We have generalized invariant subspace cryptanalysis to subspace trails and have seen that it includes truncated differential-, impossible differential- and integral attacks. For concrete applications we focused on AES-128, and this led to a method that can use <em>all</em> the aforementioned techniques to recovery the secret key for up to 5 rounds without needing to know the S-Box apart from assuming it being a permutation. When the S-Box is known we described new truncated-differential attacks with very low data complexity that are competitive with the best known attacks. It is conceivable that such attacks are also found without the subspace trail approach (truncated differential + ad-hoc optimizations of the key-recovery method that go beyond looking at the differences only), but the combination of properties of individual texts and sums of text follows more naturally from the subspace trail approach.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As one of the major results, we have proposed a new strategy to attack SPNs cipher with a single secret S-Box, if some very generic assumptions on the MixColumns matrix are satisfied. In particular, we showed how several techniques like truncated differential, impossible differential and integral attack can exploit it to recover directly (i.e. without discovering anything of the secret S-Box) the secret key for 1- up to 5- rounds of AES</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We also used this approach to give a counter-example to the conjecture of Sun et al. <em>[SLG^{+}16]</em> related to 5-round distiguishers. By doing that we also significantly improved the complexity of a distinguisher in their model, arguing however that the quest for a real 5-round distinguisher (that is, a 5-round secret key distinguisher for an AES permutation which is not derived from a key recovery attack but exploits a property which is independent of the secret key) is still open. Future work includes trying to exploit the subspace properties in other ways to get more efficient or longer distinguishers, perhaps by considering also S-Box properties, to use this approach to devise more key-recovery attacks and to apply the approach to other schemes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we provide more details about the secret key distinguisher presented in Sect. using the subspace trail notation. In the following, we present an alternative description of the truncated differential distinguisher on 3-round of AES using the subspace trail notation, and we re-propose a distinguisher based on the balance property using the subspace trail notation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A possible explanation of the truncated differential distinguisher on 3-round of AES is given in Sect. 4.3. Here we show that it is possible to obtain the same result considering the intersection of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_I</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_J</span>  after one round, instead of the intersection of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_I</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_J</span>  after two rounds.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Consider a coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_I</span>  as starting point. As we have seen in Lemma 1, a coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_I</span>  is mapped into a coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_I</span>  with probability 1 after one round. Thus, if we consider two elements that belong to the same cosets of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_I</span> , after one round they belong in the same coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_I</span>  for sure. However, at the same time and with a certain probability, it is possible that these two elements belong to the same coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_J \\cap \\mathcal{C}_I \\subseteq \\mathcal{D}_J</span>  for a certain  <span class="math">J</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">Integral cryptanalysis [DKR97, KW02] is a cryptanalytic attack that is particularly applicable to block ciphers based on substitution-permutation networks, like AES. Unlike differential cryptanalysis, which uses pairs of chosen plaintexts with a fixed XOR difference, integral cryptanalysis uses sets (or multi-sets) of chosen plaintexts in which one part is held constant and another part varies through all possibilities. For example, an attack might use 256 chosen plaintexts that have all but 1 of its byte the same, and all differ in that 1 byte. Such a set has a XOR sum of 0, and it is possible to prove that the XOR sum of the corresponding sets after three rounds is equal to 0.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">An integral distinguisher can also be constructed for four rounds of AES. In particular, a 4-round integral distinguisher for AES exploits the fact that summing over all <span class="math">2^{32}</span> ciphertexts (formed by encrypting a coset of a diagonal space <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_{i}</span> four rounds) is zero (e.g. <em>[x13]</em> for details). Here we show how this zero-sum distinguisher can be re-interpreted in terms of subspace trails. The same analysis can also be done for 3-round AES.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">First of all, note that the entire space <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{8}}^{4\\times 4}</span> can be decomposed as <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{8}}^{4\\times 4}=\\mathcal{M}_{0}\\oplus\\mathcal{M}_{1}\\oplus\\mathcal{M}_{2}\\oplus\\mathcal{M}_{3}</span>, where <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_{j}</span> is the <span class="math">j</span>-th mixed space defined above. Let <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_{I}=\\mathcal{M}_{0}\\oplus\\mathcal{M}_{1}\\oplus\\mathcal{M}_{2}</span>. If we encrypt the <span class="math">2^{32}</span> plaintexts of a coset of <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_{i}</span> (for four round with the final MixColumns), we get a set of <span class="math">2^{32}</span> ciphertexts <span class="math">C=\\{c_{1},c_{2},\\ldots,c_{2^{32}}\\}</span>, where each <span class="math">c_{i}</span> belongs to a different coset of <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_{I}</span>. If we decompose these vectors with respect to the subspaces <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_{i}</span>, each <span class="math">c_{i}</span> can be written as <span class="math">c_{i}=c_{i,0}\\oplus c_{i,1}\\oplus c_{i,2}\\oplus c_{i,3}</span> where <span class="math">c_{i,j}\\in\\mathcal{M}_{j}</span>. Since each <span class="math">c_{i}</span> belongs to a different coset of <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_{I}</span>, it means that the components <span class="math">c_{i,3}</span> are all different; thus their sum must be zero since it amounts to summing over all vectors in <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_{3}</span>. Since this property holds for all four choices of <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_{I}</span>, it means that all of the components <span class="math">c_{i,j}</span> must be different with respect to the same subspace <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_{j}</span>, thus the sum over all the vectors in <span class="math">C</span> is zero.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For completeness, another explanation of the 4-round zero-sum distinguisher is possible, and exploits the subspace trail and the zero-sum property over 3 rounds. As we have seen, a coset of a diagonal space <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_{i}\\oplus a</span> is mapped after one round into a coset of a column space <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{i}\\oplus b</span>. Let <span class="math">i=0</span> for simplicity. By definition, <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{0}\\oplus b=(\\mathcal{C}_{0}\\cap\\mathcal{D}_{0})\\oplus(\\mathcal{C}_{0}\\cap\\mathcal{D}_{1,2,3})\\oplus b</span>, that is:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{0}\\oplus b=\\bigcup_{x\\in(\\mathcal{C}_{0}\\cap\\mathcal{D}_{1,2,3})\\oplus b}(\\mathcal{C}_{0}\\cap\\mathcal{D}_{0})\\oplus x,</span></p>

Differential cryptanalysis traditionally considers characteristics or differentials with relatively high probabilities and uses them to distinguish the correct unknown keys from the wrong keys. The idea is that the difference predicted by the differential appears frequently only when the correct key is used to decrypt the last few rounds of many pairs of ciphertexts. Impossible differential analysis exploits instead the differences which should not occur (i.e., that have probability exactly zero). In this case, a key that decrypts a pair of ciphertexts to that difference is certainly wrong.</th>

    <p class="text-gray-300">that is the second, the third and the fourth columns of the two texts are equal after one round<span class="math">^{17}</span>.

Thus, all the keys such that <span class="math">R(p^1) \\oplus R(p^2) \\in \\mathcal{D}_I</span> are certainly wrong.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">There are three possibilities that can be exploited for an impossible differential attack, which are <span class="math">\\dim(\\mathcal{D}_I) = 4</span> and <span class="math">\\dim(\\mathcal{ID}_J) = 12</span>, <span class="math">\\dim(\\mathcal{D}_I) = 12</span> and <span class="math">\\dim(\\mathcal{ID}_J) = 4</span>, and finally <span class="math">\\dim(\\mathcal{D}_I) = \\dim(\\mathcal{ID}_J) = 8</span>.

In particular, the first combination is exploited for example in [LDKK08] and in [BA08], while the second one is exploited in [MDRM10]. Interestingly, in literature there isn't any attack that exploits the last (impossible) input/output combination of differences. A possible reason of this fact is that using this combination it is not possible to attack 7 rounds of AES-128 as for the other combinations. Moreover, even if it is possible to attack 7 rounds of AES-192 and 8 rounds of AES-256 using it, our results (omitted due to page limit) show that in this case the data and the computational complexity is not better than the other attacks already present in literature that exploit the first and the second impossible combinations.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-48" class="text-2xl font-bold">E Key Recovery Attacks on 3 and 4 Rounds of AES</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Starting from the subspace trails of AES found in the previous section, in the following we show how to exploit them to set up low-data complexity attacks. In particular, in the following we focus only on the subspace trail distinguisher on 2 rounds presented in Sect. 4.1 and on AES-128. The following attack is a truncated differential attack, where the attacker exploits the relationship among the differences of bytes in different positions to recover the key. The attack on 3 rounds can be extended at the end - App. E.4 - or at the beginning - App. E.5 - in order to set up competitive attacks on 4 rounds of AES. Moreover, it is also possible to attack 5 rounds of AES using both the extensions, but such an attack is no more competitive with respect to the others present in literature.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">^{17}</span>For completeness, to show this fact we compute the <span class="math">i</span>-th column of <span class="math">SR^{-1}(p^1)</span> and <span class="math">SR^{-1}(p^2)</span> after one round for <span class="math">i = 1,2,3</span>.

Let <span class="math">a, b \\in \\mathcal{M}_I^\\perp</span>, and let <span class="math">s^1 \\in \\mathcal{M}_I \\oplus a</span> and <span class="math">s^2 \\in \\mathcal{M}_I \\oplus b</span>. Denote <span class="math">s</span> as the sum of <span class="math">s^1</span> and <span class="math">s^2</span>, i.e. <span class="math">s = s^1 \\oplus s^2</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Then, <span class="math">a = b</span> if and only if all the following equivalences are satisfied:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof. If <span class="math">a = b</span>, it is straightforward to prove that all the previous equivalences are satisfied.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">y_1&#x27; = y_1 \\oplus a_{1,0} \\oplus b_{1,0}</span> and observe that <span class="math">b_{1,0} = b_{1,0} \\oplus a_{1,0} \\oplus a_{1,0}</span>. Rewriting <span class="math">s_{:,0}^2</span> using <span class="math">y_1&#x27;</span> instead of <span class="math">y_1</span> and working in a similar way on all the other columns, it is easy to prove that <span class="math">s^1</span> and <span class="math">s^2</span> belong to the same coset of <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_I</span>, that is <span class="math">a = b</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using the previous Theorem and the fact that the columns of <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_I</span> depend on different and independent variables, the attacker can work independently on each column of <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_I</span> and so on each column of <span class="math">SR^{-1}(k)</span>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Given <span class="math">c^1</span> and <span class="math">c^2</span>, the attacker guesses (for example) the bytes <span class="math">k_{1,3}</span> and finds all the values of bytes <span class="math">k_{0,0}, k_{2,2}</span> and <span class="math">k_{3,1}</span> of the key of the final round such that <span class="math">s^1</span> and <span class="math">s^2</span> belong to the same coset of <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_I</span>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">The solutions of equation (11) are related to the differential uniformity of the S-Box. Since the inverse function  <span class="math">\\mathrm{S - Box^{-1}}</span>  is differential 4-uniform, there are at most four different solutions <span class="math">^{18}</span> . In particular, there are two solutions with probability  <span class="math">126 / 256</span> , four solutions with probability  <span class="math">1 / 256</span>  and zero solutions with probability  <span class="math">129 / 256</span> . That is, on average there exist about 2.016 different values that satisfy equation (11) with probability  <span class="math">49.6\\%</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Suppose for the moment that  <span class="math">c^1</span>  and  <span class="math">c^2</span>  are two ciphertexts such that  <span class="math">c_{i,j}^{1} \\neq c_{i,j}^{2}</span>  for each  <span class="math">i, j \\in \\{0, \\dots, 3\\}</span> . Guessed the byte key  <span class="math">k_{1,3}</span> , then the attacker finds  <span class="math">2.016^3 \\simeq 8.194</span>  possible combinations  <span class="math">(k_{0,0}, k_{2,2}, k_{3,1})</span>  that satisfy the equivalence (10) with probability  <span class="math">(49.6\\%)^3 \\simeq 12.2\\%</span> . Since there are 256 values of  <span class="math">k_{1,3}</span> , we have in total  <span class="math">0.122 \\times 256 \\times (2.016)^3 \\simeq 255.95</span>  combinations  <span class="math">(k_{0,0}, k_{1,3}, k_{2,2}, k_{3,1})</span>  for the first column (analogous for the others).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The computational cost to find these 256 combinations  <span class="math">(k_{0,0}, k_{1,3}, k_{2,2}, k_{3,1})</span>  for the first column (and analogous for the other ones) can be estimated at 3 (conditions)  <span class="math">\\times 2^8</span>  (values of  <span class="math">k_{1,3} \\times [2 + 2 \\times 2^8</span>  (values of  <span class="math">k_{0,0}, k_{2,2}, k_{3,1}</span>  for each condition)] = 2 <span class="math">^{18.59}</span>  S-Box look-ups and 2 <span class="math">^{17.59}</span>  XOR operations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Actually, it is possible to improve this result. Indeed, observe that if the value  <span class="math">k_{0,0}</span>  satisfies (or not) equation (10) for a given value  <span class="math">k_{1,3}</span> , then this equation is also satisfied (or not) by the value  <span class="math">k_{0,0} \\oplus c_{0,0}^{1} \\oplus c_{0,0}^{2}</span> . That is, for each  <span class="math">k_{1,3}</span>  the attacker has to test only 128 values of  <span class="math">k_{0,0}</span>  and not 256. The same consideration holds for the other bytes of the key. Thus, the computational cost to find the 256 combinations  <span class="math">(k_{0,0}, k_{1,3}, k_{2,2}, k_{3,1})</span>  for the first column (and analogous for other columns) can be estimated at  <span class="math">2^{16.59}</span>  S-Box look-ups.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using the previous procedure, the attacker is able to find  <span class="math">2^{8}</span>  combinations for each column, that is  <span class="math">(2^{8})^{4} = 2^{32}</span>  candidates of the keys in total. A first possibility is simple to store them in the memory and to do a brute force attack on these  <span class="math">2^{32}</span>  possible keys, that is to check for which of these keys the condition  <span class="math">c^{1} = R^{(3)}(p^{1})</span>  (or equivalently  <span class="math">c^{2} = R^{(3)}(p^{2})</span> ) is satisfied. In this case, the total cost of the attack is approximately  <span class="math">2^{32}</span>  executions of the three-round cipher (observe that this second step is more expensive than the first one),  <span class="math">2^{32}</span>  memory access and the memory cost is approximately  <span class="math">256 \\times 4</span>  (byte)  <span class="math">\\times 4</span>  (columns)  <span class="math">= 2^{12}</span>  byte.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This result can be a little improved if the plaintexts belong to the same coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_0\\cap \\mathcal{C}_0</span>  (where  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_0\\cap \\mathcal{C}_0</span>  has dimension 4 since  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_0\\cap \\mathcal{C}_0 = \\langle e_{0,0}\\rangle</span>  - Lemma 5). In particular, using only 2 chosen plaintexts that belong to the same coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_0</span> , the total cost of the attack is approximately of  <span class="math">2^{32}</span>  executions of the three-round cipher,  <span class="math">2^{32}</span>  memory access and the memory cost is approximately  <span class="math">256\\times 4</span>  (byte)  <span class="math">\\times 4</span>  (columns)  <span class="math">= 2^{12}</span>  byte.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">By definition,  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_0\\cap \\mathcal{C}_0</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_0\\cap \\mathcal{M}_0</span>  correspond to symbolic matrix:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">a_{i}(\\cdot)</span>  are defined as in (8). Using similar arguments as before, for each  <span class="math">a\\in (\\mathcal{D}_0\\cap \\mathcal{C}_0)^\\perp</span>  there exist unique  <span class="math">b\\in (\\mathcal{C}_0\\cap \\mathcal{M}_0)^\\perp</span>  and unique  <span class="math">c\\in \\mathcal{M}_0^\\perp</span>  such that:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Thus, suppose that the attacker has found  <span class="math">2^{8}</span>  possible combinations for each column of the secret key. Instead to attack by brute force all the  <span class="math">2^{32}</span>  possible keys, the idea is the following. Given  <span class="math">c^{1}</span>  and  <span class="math">c^{2}</span>  and a (possible) key  <span class="math">k^{3}</span>  of the final round, the idea is to compute  <span class="math">s^{1} = R^{-1}(c^{1})</span>  and  <span class="math">s^{2} = R^{-1}(c^{2})</span> , that is to decrypt one round  <span class="math">c^{1}</span>  and  <span class="math">c^{2}</span> , with a</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">cost of <span class="math">16\\times 2=32</span> S-Box look-ups. Then, the attacker can easily compute <span class="math">k^{2}</span> using the inverse key schedule (cost of 4 S-Box look-ups). Finally, she checks if <span class="math">R^{-1}(s^{1})</span> and <span class="math">R^{-1}(s^{2})</span> belong to the same coset of <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{0}\\cap\\mathcal{M}_{0}</span>, that is if the first columns of <span class="math">R^{-1}(s^{1})</span> and <span class="math">R^{-1}(s^{2})</span> satisfied conditions similar to (10). The cost of this last operation is 8 S-Box look-ups. Since these conditions are verified with probability <span class="math">2^{-24}</span>, only <span class="math">2^{8}</span> possible keys of <span class="math">k^{3}</span> satisfy these conditions. The cost of this step is <span class="math">2^{32}\\times(32+4+8)=2^{37.46}</span> S-Box look-ups, that is <span class="math">2^{31.55}</span> executions of the three-round cipher. Using a brute force attack, the attacker can find the right key among the last <span class="math">2^{8}</span> candidates.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For this attack, the attacker needs about 2 chosen plaintexts in the same coset of <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_{0}\\cap\\mathcal{C}_{0}</span>, the total computational cost is about <span class="math">2^{10.7}</span> (first step) <span class="math">+2^{31.55}</span> (check) <span class="math">+2^{8}</span> (brute force) <span class="math">=2^{31.55}</span> executions of the three-round cipher and <span class="math">2^{32}</span> memory access, and a memory cost of about <span class="math">2^{12}</span> bytes of memory (to store the combinations of the columns of the key found in the first step). In a 32-bit implementation, each round of AES can be implemented by 20 memory accesses, that is 16 look-ups table for S-Box <span class="math">+SR+MC</span> and 4 look-ups table for the key schedule. Thus, one can declare that the total complexity of the attack is approximately <span class="math">(20\\cdot 3)^{-1}\\times 2^{32}+2^{31.55}=2^{31.58}</span> executions of the three-round encryption.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remember that these results are based on the hypothesis that <span class="math">c_{i,j}^{1}\\neq c_{i,j}^{2}</span> for each <span class="math">i,j\\in\\{0,...,3\\}</span>. By simple computation, the probability that this condition is satisfied is <span class="math">(255/256)^{16}=0.9393</span>, so everything works with high probability.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-53" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">E.1.2 Recover the Secret Key using 3 Chosen Plaintexts</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Another possibility is to use a third plaintext <span class="math">p^{3}</span> that belongs to the same coset of <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_{I}</span> of <span class="math">p^{1}</span> and <span class="math">p^{2}</span> (i.e. <span class="math">p^{1}\\oplus p^{3}\\in\\mathcal{D}_{I}</span>), and such that the corresponding ciphertexts satisfy the following conditions:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">c_{i,j}^{1}\\neq c_{i,j}^{2},\\quad c_{i,j}^{1}\\neq c_{i,j}^{3},\\quad c_{i,j}^{2}\\neq c_{i,j}^{3}\\qquad\\forall i,j\\in\\{0,...,3\\}.</span> (12)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The idea is simply to repeat the first step of the attack, on the combinations of key columns that satisfy condition (10) for the first pair of texts, using a second pair of texts composed of <span class="math">p^{3}</span> and one of the first two plaintexts. That is, to eliminate the wrong keys checking the keys found previously (at the first step) with this second pair. As before, the idea is to work again on each column independently. Remember that, for each column, the right combination is the only one that satisfies the condition (10) for each pair of ciphertexts such that the corresponding plaintexts belong to the same coset of <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_{I}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using 3 chosen plaintexts and to improve the total computational cost, the attack should be a little modified. Working independently for each column, the best idea is to work only on one of the equations of (10), e.g. the first one. Given the first pair of plaintexts, the attacker is able to recover 256 possible combinations for the pair <span class="math">(k_{0,0},k_{1,3})</span>. For each one of them, the attacker checks if it verifies the condition (10) also for the second pair of plaintexts. Since on average each equation of the condition (10) is satisfied with probability <span class="math">2^{-8}</span>, the attacker finds the correct combination of <span class="math">(k_{0,0},k_{1,3})</span>. In this way, the attacker knows <span class="math">k_{1,3}</span> and so she knows the right part of equations (10). Thus, in the same way of before, she can easily discover <span class="math">k_{2,2}</span> and <span class="math">k_{3,1}</span>. However, since the attacker knows the right part of the equations, only two texts pass the first step. Indeed, observe that there are <span class="math">2^{8}</span> possible values and that each equation is satisfied only with probability <span class="math">2^{-8}</span>, thus only one text passes the test. Anyway, if <span class="math">x</span> satisfies (11), then also <span class="math">x\\oplus\\alpha</span> satisfies it. Using the second pair of texts, the attacker finds the right bytes of the key.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Working independently on each column, a good idea is to perform these two steps at the same time, that is to check the combination found with the first pair of plaintexts immediately using the second one: in this way, the attacker doesn’t need to store anything (except the right combination for each column).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remember that this result is based on the hypothesis that condition (12) is satisfied. By simple computation, this happens with probability <span class="math">(255\\cdot 254/256^{2})^{16}=82.85\\%</span>. Actually,</p>

For simplicity, in this pseudo-code, we show how to find only the first diagonal of the secret key of the last round, and we don't use the following optimization: if  <span class="math">x</span>  satisfies (11) then also  <span class="math">x \\oplus \\alpha</span>  satisfies it. To recover the entire key, it is sufficient to repeat exactly the same attack for the other diagonals using the same pairs of ciphertexts.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">the condition (12) can be (a little) relaxed. For example, three chosen plaintext such that  <span class="math">c_{0,0}^{1} = c_{0,0}^{2} \\neq c_{0,0}^{3}</span>  and  <span class="math">c_{1,3}^{1} \\neq c_{1,3}^{2} \\neq c_{1,3}^{3}</span>  can also be used to find the key. Thus, using 3 chosen plaintexts the probability of success is:  <span class="math">\\left[\\sum_{i=0}^{3} \\binom{4}{i} \\left(\\frac{255 \\cdot 254}{256^2}\\right)^{4-i} \\left(\\frac{255}{256^2}\\right)\\right]^{4} = 88.83\\%</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The computational cost for the first step can be approximated by  <span class="math">2^{-1} \\cdot 2^{8}</span>  (values of  <span class="math">k_{1,3}</span> )  <span class="math">\\times (2 + 2 \\times 2^{-1} \\cdot 2^{8}</span>  (values of  <span class="math">k_{0,0}</span> )  <span class="math">+4 \\times 256</span>  (check with 2-nd pair)  <span class="math">= 2^{15.055}</span>  S-Box look-ups, while the cost for the second step is  <span class="math">2 \\times 2^{-1} \\cdot 2^{8}</span>  (values of  <span class="math">k_{2,2}</span>  and  <span class="math">k_{3,1}</span> )  <span class="math">+2 \\times 2</span>  (check with 2-nd pair)  <span class="math">= 2^{8}</span>  S-Box look-ups. In conclusion, our attack needs 3 chosen plaintexts (one plaintext is in common for the two pairs) and the total computational cost is approximately 4 (columns)  <span class="math">\\times (2^{15.055} + 2 \\times 2^{8}) = 2^{17.08}</span>  S-Box look-ups, that is about  <span class="math">2^{11.2}</span>  executions of the three-round cipher (the memory cost is negligible).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, note that after the identification of a subspace trail the previous attack can be easily generalized to other AES-like ciphers.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is also possible to perform the previous attack in a slight different way, that is using look-ups table. First of all, for each values of  <span class="math">\\alpha</span>  and  <span class="math">\\beta</span> , the idea is to precompute the values of  <span class="math">x</span>  that satisfy condition (11) and to store them in a table. The cost of this precomputation is approximately  <span class="math">2^{16}</span>  S-Box look-ups <span class="math">^{19}</span> , that is about  <span class="math">2^{10.1}</span>  executions of</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Subspace Trail Cryptanalysis and its Applications to AES</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">three-round AES. The memory cost to store this table is approximately <span class="math">(2^{8})^{2} = 2^{16}</span> bytes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Then, for each column, the attacker is able to discover the 256 key combinations with <span class="math">3 \\cdot 2^{8}</span> look-ups table (that is, 3 look-ups table for each values of <span class="math">k_{1,3}</span>). In order to find the right key among these combinations, she can use the same techniques described previously, or she can use another pair of plaintexts and again the look-ups table. On average, using 3 chosen plaintexts and working in the same way described previously, for each column the attacker needs <span class="math">2^{8}</span> look-ups table and <span class="math">2^{8} \\cdot 4 = 2^{10}</span> S-Box look-ups to discover <span class="math">k_{0,0}</span> and <span class="math">k_{1,3}</span> (i.e. the attacker finds the 256 possible values of <span class="math">(k_{0,0}, k_{1,3})</span> using look-ups table, and then tests them with the second pair of texts), and 2 look-ups table to discover the other 2 bytes. Thus, the total computational cost is of <span class="math">4 \\cdot (2^{8} + 2) = 2^{10.02}</span> look-ups table (with a memory cost of <span class="math">2^{16}</span> bytes) and <span class="math">2^{10} \\cdot 2 = 2^{11}</span> S-Box look-ups (since she needs <span class="math">2^{10}</span> S-Box look-ups to compute the value of <span class="math">\\beta</span> for each value of <span class="math">k_{1,3}</span>), that is <span class="math">2^{5.1}</span> executions of three-round AES (the precomputation cost is about <span class="math">2^{10.1}</span> executions of three-round AES). Since 1 round of AES can be approximated by <span class="math">20 \\simeq 2^{4.32}</span> memory accesses<span class="math">^{20}</span>, one can declare that the total complexity of the attack is approximately <span class="math">(20 \\cdot 3)^{-1} \\times 2^{10} + 2^{5.1} = 2^{5.68}</span> executions of the three-round encryption.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-55" class="text-2xl font-bold">E.1.4 3-Round Attacks - Final Round with MixColumns Operation</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For sake of completeness, the attacks on 3 rounds described in App. E.1 work exactly in the same way in the case in which the MixColumns operation is not omitted in the last round. In this case, the idea (very common in the literature) is simply to change the position of the final MixColumns operation with the final AddRoundKey operation (remember that these operations are linear). In this case, the major difference is that the attacker has to work with <span class="math">\\tilde{k}</span> defined as:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\tilde {k} := M C ^ {- 1} (k), \\tag {13}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">instead of <span class="math">k</span> (the secret key of the final round). Moreover, in this case <span class="math">s^h = R^{-1}(c^h)</span> (for <span class="math">h = 1,2</span>) are defined as <span class="math">s_{i,j}^{h} = \\mathrm{S - Box}^{-1}(\\tilde{c}_{i,j + i}^{h}\\oplus \\tilde{k}_{i,j + i})</span> where <span class="math">i,j = 0,\\dots,3</span> (and <span class="math">i + j</span> is taken modulo 4) and where <span class="math">\\tilde{c}^h\\coloneqq MC^{-1}(c^h)</span>. Note that when all bytes of <span class="math">\\tilde{k}</span> have been determined, the secret key <span class="math">k</span> can be recovered by <span class="math">k = MC(\\tilde{k})</span>.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-56" class="text-2xl font-bold">E.2 The Attack on 1 and 2 Rounds of AES</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, note that the same attack can be used to attack 1 and 2 round of AES. In the case of 2 rounds of AES, consider the following situation:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Differential cryptanalysis [BS91] is a general form of cryptanalysis applicable to block ciphers. It studies how differences in information input can affect the resulting difference at the output. Differential attacks exploit the fact that pairs of plaintexts with certain differences yield other differences in the corresponding ciphertexts with a non-uniformity probability distribution. Statistical key information is deduced from ciphertext blocks obtained by encrypting pairs of plaintext block with a specific (bitwise) difference under the target key. In particular, for a pair of plaintexts related by a constant (bitwise) difference, one tries for all values of the round key in the last round if the expected difference in the ciphertexts occurs. This is repeated several times and the most suggested values are assumed to be the value of the secret key of the last round. Attacks following this basic attack vector can not be described without considering the details of the S-Boxes of the cipher as it affects the probability of events. A variant of this attack is the truncated differential attack [Knu95], in which the attacker considers only part of the difference</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">between pairs of texts, i.e. it is a differential attack where only part of the difference in the ciphertexts can be predicted. As truncated differential cryptanalysis can be described without considering details of S-Box and since subspace trail cryptanalysis is largely independent of concrete choices of an S-Box, truncated differential cryptanalysis is hence much closer in nature to subspace trail cryptanalysis.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Starting from the previous attack on 3 rounds, in this section we show how to extend it at the end in order to attack 4 rounds of AES. In a similar way, in App. E.5 we show how to attack 4 rounds of AES extending the previous attack on 3 rounds at the beginning. Consider the following situation:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">p\\xrightarrow{R^{(2)}(.)}s\\xrightarrow{R(.)}z\\xrightarrow{R_{I}(.)}c,</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">p\\in\\mathcal{D}_{I}\\oplus a</span> (for a fixed <span class="math">a\\in\\mathcal{D}_{I}^{+}</span>) and MixColumns operation is omitted (only for simplicity) in the final round.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As we have seen, if <span class="math">p^{1}\\oplus p^{2}\\in\\mathcal{D}_{I}</span>, then <span class="math">s^{1}\\oplus s^{2}\\in\\mathcal{M}_{I}</span>. The idea of the attack is simply to guess part of the key of the final round, in order to partially decrypt <span class="math">c</span> and obtain (part of) <span class="math">z</span>. Then the attacker can repeat the attack on 3 rounds, working on <span class="math">z</span> and exploiting the relationships that hold between the bytes of <span class="math">s^{1}\\oplus s^{2}</span>. In this case, the attacker founds on average one values of <span class="math">k^{3}</span> for each guessed value of <span class="math">k^{4}</span>. Thus, she can not say anything</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">about <span class="math">k^{3}</span> a priori, since it depends on the guessed value of <span class="math">k^{4}</span>. That is, she has to check that the key of the third round <span class="math">k^{3}</span> and of the final round <span class="math">k^{4}</span> satisfy the key schedule. If they satisfy the key schedule, then the attacker has found the right key, otherwise she has to repeat the previous procedure for the other values of <span class="math">k^{4}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the following, we give all the details of the attack. In the first part, the attacker guesses two columns of the last key <span class="math">k^{4}</span>, partial decrypts the pairs of ciphertexts and discovers part of the key of the third round <span class="math">k^{3}</span>, using the attack on 3 rounds described previously. Then she checks that the found key satisfies the key schedule with the guessed key <span class="math">k^{4}</span>. In the second part of the attack, for the key candidates that satisfy the key schedule, the attacker is able to recover other bytes of <span class="math">k^{4}</span> and <span class="math">k^{3}</span> (using again the key schedule). In order to find the complete secret key, the attacker has to guess the remaining unknown bytes of the secret key and to do a brute force attack. The attack can be performed using three or only two chosen plaintexts.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-59" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">E.4.1 Details of the Attack</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Details of the First Part of the Attack. In order to show our attack, suppose that the attacker guesses the following eight bytes of the key of the final round <span class="math">k^{4}</span>:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">SR(k_{i,3}^{4})=k_{i,3-i}^{4}\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad SR(k_{i,0}^{4})=k_{i,-i}^{4}\\qquad\\forall i\\in\\{0,1,2,3\\},</span> (14)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">that is the first and the fourth columns of <span class="math">k^{4}</span> after the ShiftRows operation (the index <span class="math">-i</span> is taken module 4). Observe that there are <span class="math">(2^{8})^{8}=2^{64}</span> possibilities in total. Note that since the attacker can not impose any restriction/condition on the secret key, she has to repeat the following steps for each possible values of these eight bytes of <span class="math">k^{4}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using these guessed key bytes of <span class="math">k^{4}</span> and three given ciphertexts <span class="math">c^{1},c^{2},c^{3}</span> (which plaintexts <span class="math">p^{1},p^{2},p^{3}</span> belong to the same coset of <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_{I}</span>), the attacker is able to compute:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">z_{i,j}^{h}=\\text{S-Box}^{-1}(c_{i,j+i\\ \\text{mod}\\ 4}^{h}\\oplus k_{i,j+i\\ \\text{mod}\\ 4}^{4})\\qquad\\forall h\\in\\{1,2,3\\},\\,\\forall j\\in\\{0,3\\},\\,\\forall i.</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The cost of this step is <span class="math">2^{64}\\cdot 8\\cdot 3=2^{68.6}</span> S-Box look-ups. Note that the positions of the guessed bytes of the key <span class="math">k^{4}</span> can not be chosen in an arbitrary way, since in the following step the attacker has to apply the InverseMixColumns operation on two columns of <span class="math">z</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using <span class="math">z^{1},z^{2}</span> and <span class="math">z^{3}</span> (instead of <span class="math">c^{1},c^{2},c^{3}</span>), the attacker can repeat the previous attack on 3 rounds and finds eight bytes (i.e. first and fourth columns) of the key <span class="math">k^{3}</span>, in order to guarantee that <span class="math">s^{i}\\oplus s^{j}\\in\\mathcal{M}_{I}</span> for each <span class="math">i,j=1,2,3</span>. In this case, note that for each column the attacker can impose only one relationship that involves two bytes, and not three relationships as in the previous attack on 3 round. For example, the only relationship that holds for the first column is the following (analogous for the others):</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\text{S-Box}^{-1}(\\hat{z}_{0,0}^{1}\\oplus\\tilde{k}_{0,0}^{3})\\oplus\\text{S-Box}^{-1}(\\hat{z}_{0,0}^{2}\\oplus\\tilde{k}_{0,0}^{3})=\\alpha[\\text{S-Box}^{-1}(\\hat{z}_{1,0}^{1}\\oplus\\tilde{k}_{1,0}^{3})\\oplus\\text{S-Box}^{-1}(\\hat{z}_{1,0}^{2}\\oplus\\tilde{k}_{1,0}^{3})],</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">\\tilde{k}^{3}=SR^{-1}(MC^{-1}(k^{3}))</span> and <span class="math">\\hat{z}=SR^{-1}(MC^{-1}(z))</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Thus, given eight byte of <span class="math">k^{4}</span>, the computational cost to find 8 bytes of <span class="math">k^{3}</span> is approximately <span class="math">4\\times 2^{7}\\times(2+2\\cdot 2^{7})=2^{17}</span> S-Box look-ups and <span class="math">2^{5}</span> byte of memory. That is, the computational cost to find the <span class="math">2^{64}</span> combinations of all the eight bytes of <span class="math">k^{3}</span> (equivalently <span class="math">\\tilde{k}^{3}</span> - note that we are working with columns of <span class="math">SR(k^{3})</span>) and <span class="math">k^{4}</span> is <span class="math">2^{64}\\times 2^{17}=2^{81}</span> S-Box look-ups.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">When the attacker has found eight bytes of <span class="math">k^{3}</span>, she has to check if they satisfy the key schedule. In particular, the following three conditions between the eight bytes of <span class="math">k^{3}</span> and the eight bytes of <span class="math">k^{4}</span> hold:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">k_{0,0}^{4}=\\text{S-Box}(k_{1,3}^{3})\\oplus k_{0,0}^{3}\\oplus 0\\text{x}08,\\quad k_{3,0}^{4}=\\text{S-Box}(k_{0,3}^{3})\\oplus k_{3,0}^{3},\\quad k_{1,3}^{4}=k_{1,3}^{3}\\oplus k_{1,2}^{4}.</span> (15)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Details of the Second Part of the Attack. In order to find the right key, the idea is to test the <span class="math">2^{40}</span> found combinations using a brute force attack. Observe that for each of these combinations (composed of eight bytes of <span class="math">k^{4}</span> and 8 bytes of <span class="math">k^{3}</span>), the attacker can compute other four bytes of <span class="math">k^{4}</span> using the key schedule, that is:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">k_{1,0}^{4}=</span> <span class="math">\\text{S-Box}(k_{2,3}^{3})\\oplus k_{1,0}^{3},</span> <span class="math">k_{2,3}^{4}=k_{2,3}^{3}\\oplus k_{2,2}^{4},</span> <span class="math">k_{2,0}^{4}=</span> <span class="math">\\text{S-Box}(k_{3,3}^{3})\\oplus k_{2,0}^{3},</span> <span class="math">k_{0,2}^{4}=k_{0,3}^{3}\\oplus k_{0,3}^{4}.</span> (16)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and (in an analogous way) three bytes of <span class="math">k^{3}</span>, which are <span class="math">k_{2,1}^{3},k_{2,2}^{3}</span> and <span class="math">k_{3,1}^{3}</span>. Thus, four bytes of the key of the final round <span class="math">k^{4}</span> are still unknown, which are:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">k_{0,1}^{4}\\qquad k_{1,1}^{4}\\qquad k_{3,2}^{4}\\qquad k_{3,3}^{4},</span> (17)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">k_{3,2}^{4}\\oplus k_{3,3}^{4}=k_{3,0}^{3}</span> (18)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and <span class="math">k_{3,0}^{3}</span> is known. To do the brute force attack, the idea is simply to guess those three bytes. That is, the attacker has to test <span class="math">2^{40}\\cdot(2^{8})^{3}=2^{64}</span> possible keys by brute force. The cost of this step is <span class="math">2^{64}</span> four-round AES. Only for completeness, note that another possibility is to consider plaintexts that belong to the same coset of <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_{0}\\cap\\mathcal{C}_{0}</span>, and to use the fact that after one round they belong to the same coset of <span class="math">\\mathcal{C}_{0}\\cap\\mathcal{M}_{0}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As for the attack on 3 rounds, a good idea is to perform these two steps at the same time, that is to test the keys found in the first step by the brute force attack. In this way, the attacker doesn’t need to store anything.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In conclusion, for this attack the attacker needs 3 different chosen plaintexts and the computational cost is approximately <span class="math">2^{68.6}+2^{81}\\simeq 2^{81}</span> S-Box look-ups for the first part of the attack, that is about <span class="math">2^{74.7}</span> four-round AES, and then a further <span class="math">2^{64}</span> four-round AES for the brute force attack of the second part, that is in total <span class="math">2^{74.7}+2^{64}\\simeq 2^{74.7}</span> four-round AES (the memory cost is negligible).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Observe that the first step of this attack can be performed using only table look-ups, in the same way of the attack described in App. E. In this case, the cost of the first step of the attack becomes <span class="math">2^{64}\\cdot 2^{12}=2^{76}</span> memory access, since the cost of the attack on 3 rounds is <span class="math">2^{12}</span> memory access and the attacker has to repeat this step for all the <span class="math">2^{64}</span> possible values of the 8 bytes of the key of the final rounds. Thus, in this case the attacker needs 3 different chosen plaintexts, the computational cost is approximately <span class="math">2^{76}</span> memory accesses and <span class="math">2^{64}</span> four-round AES encryptions, and the memory cost is about <span class="math">2^{16}</span> bytes. Using a previous observation (1 round of AES <span class="math">\\approx 20</span> memory accesses), one can declare that the total complexity of the attack is approximately <span class="math">(20\\cdot 4)^{-1}\\times 2^{76}+2^{64}=2^{69.71}</span> executions of the four-round encryption.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-60" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">E.4.2 Attack with <em>only</em> 2 Chosen Plaintexts (or more than 3)</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is also possible to mount this attack using only 1 pair of chosen plaintexts, that is 2 chosen plaintexts are sufficient to discover the secret key. At the first step, using a single pair of chosen plaintexts, the attacker is able to discover <span class="math">2^{32}</span> combinations for the eight bytes of <span class="math">k^{3}</span> for each combination of the eight bytes of <span class="math">k^{4}</span>. Instead to use a third chosen plaintext to find the right combination, the idea is simply to do a brute force attack. In particular, using the conditions (15), the attacker is able to eliminate <span class="math">2^{24}</span> wrong combinations. Then, for each of the <span class="math">2^{8}</span> survived combinations, she can easily find other four bytes of <span class="math">k^{4}</span> using the conditions (16), and (in the same way as before) she guesses the remaining four bytes of <span class="math">k^{4}</span> (remember that it is sufficient to guess only three of them). Thus, for each combination of the eight bytes of <span class="math">k^{4}</span>, the attacker has to test by brute force <span class="math">2^{32}</span> values. This means that in total she has to test by brute force <span class="math">2^{32}\\times(2^{8})^{8}=2^{96}</span> possible values. In conclusion, for this attack, the attacker needs 2 different chosen plaintexts and the computational cost is <span class="math">2^{96}</span> four-round AES (the memory cost is negligible).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We also show that it is not possible to improve the computational cost of the attack using more chosen plaintexts. Indeed, in the second step of the attack with three chosen plaintexts, suppose to check the <span class="math">2^{40}</span> survived combinations with other two pairs of plaintexts that belong to the same coset <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_{I}\\oplus a</span>. That is, given <span class="math">p^{4}</span> and <span class="math">p^{5}</span>, the attacker check for which combinations of the 8 bytes of the keys <span class="math">k^{3}</span> and <span class="math">k^{4}</span>, the conditions <span class="math">s^{1}\\oplus s^{4}\\in\\mathcal{M}_{I}</span> and <span class="math">s^{1}\\oplus s^{5}\\in\\mathcal{M}_{I}</span> are satisfied. Observe that the probability that both these conditions are satisfied is <span class="math">2^{-64}</span>, thus only one key (the right one) survived. Anyway, the total computational cost of this variant is again approximately <span class="math">2^{74.7}</span> four-round AES, since the most expensive step of the attack is the first one, which doesn’t change if the attacker uses more than three chosen plaintexts.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, these two versions of this attack work in a similar way if MixColumns operation is not omitted in the last round. In this case, the idea is simply to change the position of MixColumns operation with the final AddRoundKey operation. As these operations are linear they can be interchanged, by first XORing the data with an equivalent version of the key (that is <span class="math">\\tilde{k}^{4}:=MC^{-1}(k^{4})</span>) and only then applying the MixColumns operation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Practical Verification. Since this attack on 4 rounds with the extension at the end has a very high computational cost, we tested it in a different way. As we have seen, the attacker has to guess eight bytes of the final key, for a total of <span class="math">2^{64}</span> possibilities. In our experiments, the attacker guesses only two bytes of the final key instead of eight, where the remaining six bytes are fixed and equal to those of the secret key. In this way, the total complexity of the attack becomes more feasible for a real test and allows us to have a practical verification of the attack.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">E.5 Key-recovery Attack on 4 Rounds of AES - Extending the 3 Rounds Attack at the Beginning</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the previous section, we have showed how to extend at the end the attack on 3 rounds presented in App. E. In this section, we show how to attack 4 rounds extending at the beginning the attack on 3 rounds. As we’ll show, both from the computational point of view and from the data complexity point of view, this attack on 4 rounds is better if <span class="math">\\dim(\\mathcal{D}_{I})=12</span> than <span class="math">\\dim(\\mathcal{D}_{I})=4</span>. Since the attack on 3 rounds given in Sect. E works the same when <span class="math">\\dim(\\mathcal{D}_{I})=12</span>, we present it in details in the end of this section. We limit ourselves to report the data and the computational complexity of this attack. In the case in which <span class="math">\\dim(\\mathcal{D}_{I})=12</span>, the attack on 3 rounds needs 4 pairs of plaintexts, that is 5 chosen plaintexts, and the total computational cost is approximately at <span class="math">2^{31.09}</span> S-Box look-ups, that is about <span class="math">2^{25.18}</span> executions of the three-round cipher (the memory consumption is negligible), or <span class="math">2^{24.6}</span> memory access and <span class="math">2^{24.18}</span> S-Box look-ups (with a memory cost of approximately <span class="math">2^{16}</span> bytes).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As before, the idea is to eliminate some of the keys found in the previous step using other pairs of ciphertexts, and the attacker can take advantage of the independence of the columns to perform this step with a low computational cost. In particular, the probability that each column of the key found previously satisfies (22) for another pair of ciphertexts is on average  <span class="math">2^{-8}</span> . Thus, using a second pair of plaintexts, the attacker reduces the keys to  <span class="math">2^{96} \\times (2^8)^{-4} = 2^{64}</span>  with a computational cost of  <span class="math">2^{27}</span>  S-Box look-ups. Thus, the attacker needs other two pairs of plaintexts to discover the secret key (with a total computational cost of about  <span class="math">2^{19} + 2^{11}</span>  S-Box look-ups). Performing these steps at the same time, that is checking the combinations found with the first pair of plaintexts immediately with the other ones, allows to save memory.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Subspace Trail Cryptanalysis and its Applications to AES</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that using 5 chosen plaintexts the attacker can construct 10 different pairs, but only 4 of them are useful for the attack. For example, suppose that the attacker uses a (first) pair formed by the first and the by second ciphertext, and a (second) that formed by the first and by the third ciphertext. Then the keys that satisfy (22) for these two pairs, automatically satisfy (22) for the pair formed by the second and by the third ciphertext. However, using four pairs of plaintexts with one plaintext in common (that is, 5 different chosen plaintexts), the probability of success is greater than <span class="math">99.9\\%</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In conclusion, this attack needs 4 pairs of plaintexts, that is 5 chosen plaintexts, the total computational cost is approximately at <span class="math">2^{31.09}</span> S-Box look-ups, that is about <span class="math">2^{25.18}</span> executions of the three-round cipher (the memory cost is negligible).

Moreover, it is also possible to consider the case in which only one row of the MixColumns matrix has two identical elements. In this case, it is not possible to recover all the key bytes using the previous procedure, but at most four byte-differences (one per diagonal). However, it is still possible to find the secret key, working also on the secret S-Box. The details of this procedure are given in App. G.2.2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Practical Verification. The attack just presented has been practically verified: as final thing, we report here the practical results. Suppose that an attacker is looking for a byte difference, e.g.  <span class="math">\\delta \\equiv k_{0,0} \\oplus k_{1,1}</span>  (similarly for the other cases). As we have seen, in order to have a probability of success higher than  <span class="math">95\\%</span> , she has to use 3 pairs of texts (with one text in common), and the computational cost can be approximated by  <span class="math">3 \\cdot 2^{8} = 768</span>  XOR operations (in the worse case). However, consider the case of a wrong guessed value of  <span class="math">\\delta</span> . In this case, when the attacker finds the first pair of ciphertexts that doesn't belong to the same coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_0</span> , she can immediately deduce that the guessed value  <span class="math">\\delta</span>  is certainly wrong, without considering the other remaining pairs. For this reason, we can expect that the practical computational cost is lower than the theoretical one (which is computed analyzing the worse case). In effect, our practical results show that the average computational cost of the attacker is of 261 XOR operations, that is  <span class="math">1/3</span>  of the theoretical one.</p>

Collecting enough equations and working exactly as in <em>[x19]</em>, it is possible to recover (an equivalent representation of) this function.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Assume that this function is found (we refer to <em>[x19]</em> for more details), and note that similar relationships hold among the bytes of the other diagonals.

Working in the same way for all the diagonals, this allows to reduce the possible variants of the whitening key to <span class="math">2^{8}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, note that for this step we are forced to use chosen ciphertexts instead of chosen plaintexts.

Since the key schedule involves some S-Box operations, it is not possible to use it to find <span class="math">k^{3}</span> given variants of the whitening key. Thus, a possible way to overcome the problem is to consider chosen ciphertexts, in order to find relationships that involves <span class="math">\\mathrm{S-Box}(\\cdot\\oplus k)</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Algorithm 9: Square Attack on 3-round of AES with secret S-Box. The same attack can be used to find the remaining part of the key.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">after 2 rounds, it follows that the 3-round encryption of  <span class="math">V_{\\delta}</span>  has the balance property if  <span class="math">\\delta = k_{0,0} \\oplus k_{1,1}</span> . Instead, if  <span class="math">\\delta \\neq k_{0,0} \\oplus k_{1,1}</span> , the probability that  <span class="math">V_{\\delta}</span>  satisfies the balance property after 3-round if  <span class="math">\\delta \\neq k_{0,0} \\oplus k_{1,1}</span>  is  <span class="math">(2^{-8})^{-16} = 2^{-128}</span> , since it is not in general possible to guarantee any property of the one round of encryption of  <span class="math">V_{\\delta}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Thus, the idea is to consider  <span class="math">2^{8}</span>  different sets  <span class="math">V_{\\delta}</span> , one for each possible values of  <span class="math">\\delta</span> , and to check if the balance property on the ciphertexts is satisfied or not. If the balance property is not satisfied, then the value  <span class="math">\\delta</span>  as candidate for  <span class="math">k_{0,0} \\oplus k_{1,1}</span>  is certainly wrong. What is the probability that all the false candidates don't satisfy this test? By simply computation is  <span class="math">(1 - 2^{-128})^{2^8 - 1} \\simeq 1 - 2^{-120}</span> . As a result, in order to find one byte of the secret key, the data complexity is  <span class="math">2^{8} \\cdot 2^{8} = 2^{16}</span> , while the computational complexity can be approximated to  <span class="math">2^{16}</span>  XOR operations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As for the attack of App. G.1, the idea is to repeat the attack for three different consecutive-diagonal bytes, and for all the four diagonals. In this way, the attacker is able to find  <span class="math">2^{32}</span>  variants of the whitening key without working on the secret S-Box. The total data complexity for the attack can be approximated to  <span class="math">12 \\cdot 2^{16} = 2^{19.6}</span>  chosen plaintexts, and a cost of  <span class="math">2^{19.6}</span>  XOR operations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For completeness, using the same strategy of App. G.1, one can reduce this number of variants to  <span class="math">2^{8}</span>  working also on the secret S-Box.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Practical Verification. As last thing, we report that for this attack the practical computational cost is approximately the same of the theoretical one, and that the given data complexity allows to have an high probability of success, as indicated above.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As for the case of 3-round of AES, we present an attack on 4-round of AES with secret S-Box which exploits the truncated differential attack and the subspace trail. The previous truncated differential attack on 3-round of AES with secret S-Box exploits a subspace trail with probability 1. In this section, we present a truncated differential to attack 4-round of AES with secret S-Box - illustrated in Fig. 14 - that exploits the subspace trail described in Sect. 4.3, which has probability strictly less than 1 (but greater than 0).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The idea of the attack is to exploit the fact that two elements that belong to the same coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_I</span>  belong to the same coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{M}_J</span>  after three rounds with probability higher than two random elements, as we have showed in Sect. 4.3. To set up the attack, we exploit this fact together with the possibility to map a subset of a coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_i</span>  (which depends on the secret key) into a subset of a coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_I</span>  after one round.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Consider two plaintexts  <span class="math">p^1</span>  and  <span class="math">p^2</span>  such that  <span class="math">p_{i,j}^1 = p_{i,j}^2</span>  for each  <span class="math">(i,j) \\neq \\{(0,0),(1,1)\\}</span>  and  <span class="math">p_{0,0}^1 \\oplus p_{1,1}^1 = p_{0,0}^2 \\oplus p_{1,1}^2 = \\delta</span> . As we have seen, if  <span class="math">\\delta = k_{0,0} \\oplus k_{1,1}</span> , then the two plaintexts belong to the same coset of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_{0,1,3}</span>  after one round. First of all, the previous choice of plaintexts can be generalized.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Practical Verification. The attack just presented has been practically verified: as final thing, we report here the practical results. For simplicity, here we limit to report the results when the attacker tries to find two bytes of the secret key - as <span class="math">k_{0,0}\\oplus k_{1,1}</span> and <span class="math">k_{1,2}\\oplus k_{2,3}</span> - using <span class="math">2^{13}</span> different chosen plaintexts. These results can be easily extended for the complete attack, as described in the previous text. For completeness, we consider both the two cases in which the attacker (1) re-orders the texts before to count the number of collisions (working only on consecutive ordered elements), or (2) constructs all the possible pairs. This second setting allows to understand better the importance of the re-ordering algorithm in terms of performance/computational cost.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the second case (that is the one in which all the possible pairs are constructed - no use of the re-ordering algorithm), the expected theoretical computational cost in order to find 2 bytes of the secret key is of <span class="math">(2^{8})^{2}\\cdot 2^{12}\\cdot(2^{13}-1)=2^{41}-2^{28}\\simeq 2^{41}</span> memory accesses, and it is approximately the same of the practical computational one. Instead, for the first setting (that is the one the re-order the text before to counts the number of collisions) the expected theoretical computational cost in order to find 2 bytes of the secret key is of <span class="math">4\\cdot(2^{8})^{2}\\cdot 2^{13}\\cdot(\\log 2^{13}+1)\\simeq 2^{32.8}</span> memory accesses. The average practical computational cost is approximately of <span class="math">2^{32.65}</span> memory accesses, which is very close to the theoretical one. Finally, <span class="math">2^{13}</span> chosen plaintexts are (largely) sufficient to find the right value of <span class="math">k_{0,0}\\oplus k_{1,1}</span> and <span class="math">k_{1,2}\\oplus k_{2,3}</span>, as predicted by the theory.</p>

In order to find the entire key, the idea is simply to repeat the previous attack 12 times (i.e. three times for each possible diagonal), in order to find <span class="math">2^{32}</span> variants of the whitening secret key. As shown in App. G.1 for the three round case, it is useless to repeat more times this attack, since it is not possible to reduce this number of variants without exploiting the details of the S-Box.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Subspace Trail Cryptanalysis and its Applications to AES</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Due to the huge data and computational complexities of the proposed distinguisher, it can not verified directly on AES. Here we show that - due to the same reasons - it can not also verified on small-scale AES, as presented in <em>[x10]</em>. While in “real” AES, each word is composed of 8 bits, in this variant each word is composed of 4 bits. We refer to <em>[x10]</em> for a complete description of this small-scale AES, and we limit ourselves to describe the results of our 5-round distinguisher in this case.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">First of all, note that the argumentations exploited by the proposed distinguisher hold exactly in the same way also for this small-scale variant of AES (they are independent by the fact that each word of AES is of 4 or 8 bits).

    <p class="text-gray-300">Lorenzo Grassi ^{1} , Christian Rechberger ^{1,3} and Sondre Rønjom ^{2,4}</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since each one of these sets contains <span class="math">2^{32}</span> texts (equivalently <span class="math">2^{63}</span> pairs), since there are <span class="math">2^{32}</span> possible <span class="math">\\Delta</span> and since we have to repeat this attack 4 times, the total number of texts for the attack is <span class="math">4\\cdot 2^{32}\\cdot 2^{35.74}\\cdot 2^{32}=2^{101.75}</span>, which is higher than before.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finally, using the same argumentation of Sect. 8, we can approximate the computational cost to <span class="math">4\\cdot 2^{101.75}\\cdot(\\log 2^{101.75}+1)=2^{110.4}</span> table look-ups, which is higher than before.</p>`;

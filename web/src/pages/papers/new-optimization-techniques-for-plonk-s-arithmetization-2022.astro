      <p class="text-gray-300">PlonK is a universal and updatable zk-SNARK for general circuit satisfiability that allows a verifier to check the validity of a certain NP statement very efficiently, optionally in zero-knowledge. PlonK requires that the NP relation of interest be expressed as a system of so-called PlonK constraints. Such conversion is complex and can be implemented in various ways, having a great impact on the prover complexity (which is typically linearithmic in the number of PlonK constraints).
We propose several general results for simplifying PlonK constraint systems, which produce more compact but equivalent systems and can lead to significant performance improvements. We also develop an automated optimizer of constraints, based on our techniques, that can be used to construct very compact and less error-prone constraint systems, favoring a more auditable circuit design.
Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our techniques by implementing optimized constraint systems for the Poseidon hash, obtaining the most compact representations in the Turbo-PlonK model with minimal custom gates. En route, we devise a novel optimization idea for implementing Poseidon partial rounds and show that it can be applied to both simplifying SNARK circuits and achieving performance improvements in CPU implementations of the Poseidon hash.</p>

This comes at the cost of a significantly slower prover, compared to other zero-knowledge proof systems with higher communication complexity <a href="#page-19-1">[JKO13,</a> <a href="#page-19-2">GMO16,</a> <a href="#page-18-1">CGM16]</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To be secure, SNARKs usually require a so-called structured reference string (SRS), usually comprising the successive powers of, which if known would break soundness. The generation of such SRS is usually performed collaboratively through a multi-party computation (MPC) protocol in so-called setup ceremonies <a href="#page-18-2">[BGM17]</a>. These ceremonies require a significant effort and can last for several months <a href="#page-18-3">[Com16,</a> <a href="#page-18-4">Fil20,</a> <a href="#page-17-1">Azt20]</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The first SNARKs required a new SRS for every different NP relation to be proven, however, recent designs <a href="#page-19-3">[MBKM19,</a> <a href="#page-18-5">GKM</a><sup>+</sup>18, <a href="#page-19-4">GWC19,</a> <a href="#page-18-6">CHM</a><sup>+</sup>20] use an SRS that is universal and can encode any circuit (of bounded size). Furthermore, the SRS of these new constructions is updatable and can be upgraded without having to perform a new setup ceremony. Other works <a href="#page-17-2">[BCR</a><sup>+</sup>19, <a href="#page-17-3">BDFG21]</a> even allow for an SRS to be subversion-resistant <a href="#page-17-4">[ALSZ21]</a> or in the transparent setting <a href="#page-17-5">[BFLS91]</a>, that can be generated from cryptographic hash functions, without a trusted setup.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">PlonK <a href="#page-19-4">[GWC19]</a>, which stands for Permutations over Lagrange-bases for Oecumenical Non-interactive arguments of Knowledge, is a universal and updatable zero-knowledge SNARK for general circuit satisfiability. Given its significant improvements with respect to its predecessor Sonic <a href="#page-19-3">[MBKM19]</a>, especially on prover efficiency, PlonK has become very popular and has been adopted by several state-of-the-art blockchain projects such as Zcash <a href="#page-19-5">[HBHW22]</a>, Mina <a href="#page-18-7">[BMRS20]</a>, the Dusk Network <a href="#page-19-6">[MKF21]</a> or Anoma <a href="#page-19-7">[GYB21]</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In PlonK's original paper, circuits are expressed in terms of a 2 fan-in 1 fan-out parametric arithmetic gate over an algebraic field (typically, the scalar field of an elliptic curve). The whole constraint system is transformed into polynomials which are then committed using a polynomial commitment scheme and evaluated on a random point during the proving process. On the one hand, the circuit polynomials and commitments, which correspond to the public circuit parameters, are computed in a preprocessing phase. On the other hand, the polynomials associated to the witness of the NP relation, their commitments and their evaluations are computed by the prover.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using Fast Fourier Transforms for the polynomial conversion and efficient polynomial multiplication, and computing the commitments with KZG <a href="#page-19-8">[KZG10]</a>, the prover complexity is in O(kn &middot; logn) scalar operations for the former and O(kn) group operations for the latter where k is the number of wires, and n the number of constraints.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As the gate fan-in/fan-out is limited, the arithmetization of cryptographic primitives may be inefficient and require a significant number of constraints. PlonK extensions have been developed to alleviate this issue. Turbo-PlonK <a href="#page-19-9">[GW19]</a>, for instance, allows the use of custom gates to express the same statement in fewer constraints. Many implementations <a href="#page-19-5">[HBHW22,</a> <a href="#page-18-7">BMRS20]</a> rely on this extension to enable efficient elliptic curve operations or hashing.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The circuit is furthermore limited by the SRS size. Indeed, as the polynomials are committed with the SRS, the number of constraints in a circuit is upper-bounded by the size of the SRS. As the SRS cannot be easily replaced (in a trustworthy manner), its size has direct implications on the circuit and thus on the SNARK's scope. As such, a compact representation of circuits is paramount to make PlonK-based SNARKs more practical. This is the subject of this paper.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-1.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1.1 Applications of SNARKs</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A number of blockchain projects have jumped on the opportunity of using zk-SNARKs, and leverage the unique properties that zero-knowledge proofs provide, for various applications. From identification to storage (Filecoin <a href="#page-19-10">[Lab17]</a>) as well as private transactions (Zcash <a href="#page-19-5">[HBHW22]</a>). Unlike other alternative ZK proving systems, zk-SNARKs enjoy extremely efficient verification times and very compact proofs, this makes them particularly suitable for on-chain validation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The prover is however significantly slower, typically, linearithmic in the number of polynomial constraints necessary to model the circuit associated to the NP relation. Furthermore, in most SNARK implementations, these polynomial constraints live over the scalar field of an elliptic curve, this makes it expensive to implement circuits that contain Boolean operations, since these must be simulated using scalar values over a much bigger domain. Consequently, modeling standard cryptographic primitives such as AES, SHA2 or Blake or standard digital signatures with SNARKs is costly. Alternatively, many blockchain systems have opted for adopting less standard but more SNARK-friendly hash functions such as Poseidon <a href="#page-18-8">[GKR</a><sup>+</sup>21], Rescue <a href="#page-17-6">[BCL</a><sup>+</sup>20] or Sinsemilla <a href="#page-19-5">[HBHW22]</a>. Furthermore, SNARKs are typically efficient over their native scalar field. Modelling algebraic operations over different fields would incur significant overheads. Consequently, a common solution is to implement the desired (algebraic) cryptographic primitives over a curve designed to be compatible with another curve. An example is the Jubjub curve, whose base field was designed to be compatible with the scalar field of BLS13-381.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Hash functions are an essential building block for blockchain applications, as they are the basis for Merkletree-based set accumulator schemes and signature schemes. Although SNARK-friendly hash functions can be implemented significantly more efficiently than their more standard counterparts, they are still one of the main bottlenecks <a href="#page-20-1">[WS21,</a> <a href="#page-20-2">Zca21]</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For these reasons, it is important to develop new techniques that allow us to model efficient and compact circuits of such primitives.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-1.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1.2 Our contributions</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We pursue the study of PlonK-based constraint systems and propose several general results that can lead to performance improvements and more compact proving systems.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Simplification of PlonK constraint systems. We propose generic optimization mechanisms to simplify Turbo-PlonK constraint systems. Our techniques can reduce the number of constraints and variables in the arithmetization, while preserving the satisfiability of the underlying system of polynomials equations induced by them (therefore preserving the NP relation being proved).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our simplifications exploit the fact that Turbo-PlonK constraints can access the wires corresponding to the next constraint in the system. We revisit this idea, originally proposed in <a href="#page-19-9">[GW19]</a>, which opens many new opportunities for optimization, e.g., by sharing wires across constraints (see Section <a href="#page-7-0">3.1)</a>. Furthermore, we show how different constraints with unused wires can be combined together if they are &quot;compatible&quot;; and how abandoning the input/output wires abstraction and thinking of constraints as the polynomial equations they induce can be advantageous, e.g., applying Gaussian elimination on such equations can lead to equations that can be modeled with fewer constraints.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Automated optimizer of constraints. We propose an automated mechanism for applying the above simplification techniques, abstracted out as simple rewriting rules (Section <a href="#page-8-0">3.2)</a>. This allows a user to design circuits in the original and less error-prone (but unoptimized) input/output abstraction based on arithmetic gates and then use our automated optimizer to benefit from our simplification techniques. Furthermore, our automated optimizer can lead to simplifications that could hardly be implemented manually, for example, by identifying separate parts of the circuit that can be combined together.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Optimized circuits for the Poseidon hash. We demonstrate the potential of our techniques by implementing optimized circuits for the Poseidon hash. En route, we devise a novel idea for implementing partial rounds, coined the linear skip (Section <a href="#page-10-0">4.2)</a>, that leverages the fact that partial rounds are almost linear functions, and the composition of linear functions is again a linear function. To the best of our knowledge, this technique has not been used in existing PlonK-based implementations of the Poseidon circuit <a href="#page-18-9">[Dus21,</a> <a href="#page-20-2">Zca21,</a> <a href="#page-20-1">WS21]</a> and has not been considered in the literature.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 1. This work is part of a library implemented by the Nomadic Labs' Crypto Team <a href="#page-19-11">[Nom22b]</a>, designed to develop private transactions (based on the Sapling protocol by Zcash <a href="#page-19-5">[HBHW22]</a>) and zeroknowledge rollups over the Tezos blockchain <a href="#page-19-12">[Goo14]</a>. The current proposal uses Merkle-trees as set accumulators and Schnorr signatures for validating the authenticity of transactions. Both primitives heavily rely on a secure hash function, which as been chosen to be Poseidon. This justifies our efforts to optimize constraint systems and the choice of the Poseidon hash as our use case in this paper.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-1.3" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1.3 Related work</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Zero-knowledge arguments. Zero-knowledge arguments were introduced by Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff in 1985 <a href="#page-19-13">[GMR85]</a>. They allow a prover to convince a verifier of the validity of a certain statement without revealing any other information, e.g., why the statement is true. A few years later, Blum, Feldman and Micali <a href="#page-17-7">[BFM88]</a>, extended this notion and considered non-interactive zero-knowledge arguments (NIZK), where the communication between the two parties is unilateral: the prover produces a &quot;certificate&quot; of the validity of the statement, that can be verified by everyone.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Existing generic protocols that implement zero-knowledge argument systems <a href="#page-17-7">[BFM88,</a> <a href="#page-18-10">DMP90,</a> <a href="#page-18-11">FLS90]</a> for any NP relation have been perceived as mainly theoretical results for many years, given that they used to involve expensive NP reductions and required several executions of the same routine in order to achieve reasonable soundness. Only special purpose protocols for specific NP languages <a href="#page-20-3">[Sch91,</a> <a href="#page-18-12">Cra97,</a> <a href="#page-18-13">CDS94,</a> <a href="#page-19-14">GS08]</a> were considered efficient enough for practical deployment, and they have been widely used for building digital signatures and anonymous credentials.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Recently, we have witnessed significant improvements on the design of efficient general-purpose zeroknowledge proof systems which enjoy varying degrees of practicality <a href="#page-19-0">[Gro16,</a> <a href="#page-17-8">BCG</a><sup>+</sup>17, <a href="#page-17-9">BBB</a><sup>+</sup>18, <a href="#page-19-3">MBKM19,</a> <a href="#page-19-15">LMR19]</a>. Such improvements have been motivated by the increasing development of blockchain systems that demand zero-knowledge arguments to achieve privacy and scalability <a href="#page-17-10">[BCG</a><sup>+</sup>14, <a href="#page-18-14">DFKP13]</a>. In these systems, communication complexity is one of the most important performance factors, which has led to an increasing interest and remarkable progress in so-called succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (SNARKs); or zk-SNARKs, if they provide zero-knowledge.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">PlonK family. A number of projects has branched out since PlonK's release.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Following Turbo-PlonK, Plookup <a href="#page-19-16">[GW20]</a>, in 2020, allows the use of look-up tables and as such facilitates range checks and queries with the use of new identities.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Several polynomial commitments schemes, SHPlonk [BDFG20] and FFlonk [GW21a], released in 2020 and 2021, implicitly target  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span> . FFlonk and SHPlonk are variants of the KZG protocol that respectively allow the opening multiple polynomials at a single point, via an &quot;FFT-like identity&quot;, and the opening of multiple polynomials at multiple points at lower verifier cost. However, these variants usually increase the cost of the prover or the verifier, so they may be applicable to specific scenarios only.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Updates to the original protocol were also released over the years. This include more efficient methods to handle zero-knowledge, published by Mina in 2020 [pro20], and public inputs, published by Gabizon and Williamson in 2021 [GW21b].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The Electric Coin Company changed their proving system from Groth16 to  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span>  in 2020 when publishing Halo2 [BGH]. This project presents a different &quot;PLONKish&quot; arithmetization and allows recursion. Plonkup [PFM+22], in 2022, presented an implementation of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span>  with Turbo- <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span>  and Plookup. Mir protocol released in 2022 Plonky2 [pro22] a variant of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span>  using Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive proofs (FRI) also enabling recursion.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">R1CS vs  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span> 's constraint system. Groth16 and  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span>  are the two main proof systems used in the blockchain world. They differ in many points, including the universality of the setup, but especially in their arithmetization.  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span>  uses an algebraic gate which corresponds to the equality of the addition and multiplication of two input and with an output variable while Groth16 uses Rank 1 Constraint Systems (R1CS) which corresponds to the equality of the multiplication of the sum of n variables with another sum. As such, it is hard to compare these constraint systems.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">R1CS can encode linear combinations of any size without an additional overhead, whereas  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span>  is limited by the number of wires in the gate's architecture. However,  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span>  offers custom gates which allow the verification of complex, potentially non-linear, operations in one constraint. Lookups can also be efficiently used with  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span> 's extension, Plookup, decreasing the cost of binary operations such as decompositions as well as facilitating standard cryptography such as Pedersen hash (c.f. Sinsemilla).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Alternative efficient implementations of Poseidon. In the original Poseidon paper [GKR<sup>+</sup>19, Appendix B], the authors propose an optimization that exploits the structure of partial rounds and the fact that they only involve one S-box. This idea, inspired by a similar technique proposed for LowMC [DKP<sup>+</sup>19], consists of rearranging the structure of the constant and linear layers in order to express the (linear part) of partial rounds as the multiplication by a very sparse matrix. This can greatly reduce the number of operations required for its evaluation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This technique is similar to our proposed optimization called the <em>linear skip</em>, where such (linear part) of partial rounds is replaced by the identity matrix at the cost of carrying a computation for the next layer. Another fundamental difference between the two mechanisms is that our linear skip can be applied to jumping over <em>several</em> partial rounds (at the cost of carrying a bigger linear computation with every skipped round).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">recently revisited in the case of algebraic hash functions in an effort to reduce the number of permutations. These partial SPNs (P-SPNs) gave birth to Zorro in 2013, LowMC in 2015 and MiMC in 2016 to cite a few. These P-SPNs are lighter in computational cost, but are also more difficult to analyze security-wise and are sometime vulnerable to attacks <a href="#page-18-17">[EGL</a><sup>+</sup>20].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Grassi et al. presented in 2020 the HADES Design Strategy together with an analysis framework built upon the wide trail design strategy. The Hades strategy is organized in layers, with so-called partial rounds (P-SPNs) surrounded by full rounds (SPNs) to prevent statistical attacks. They instantiated HadesMiMC and compared it in an MPC setting with MiMC, GMiMc and rescue showing a higher runtime and lower communication cost.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-2.3" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2.3 Poseidon</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Poseidon <a href="#page-18-8">[GKR</a><sup>+</sup>21] is an algebraic hash function family presented by Grassi et al. in 2020 relying on the Hades Design strategy. In particular, Poseidon consists of a substitution-permutation network applied to a state with w registers. Such network combines so-called full rounds with partial rounds. In a full round the state is modified by adding a constant to each register element, applying a non-linear function (S-box) to each of them and a linear linear layer involving all the elements in the state. Partial round are similar, but only apply the non-linear S-box to one of the register elements (see Figure <a href="#page-4-0">1)</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The use of partial rounds aims at reducing the number of non-linear (and more expensive) operations. For this reason, it is particularly amenable for its implementation in R1CS constraint systems and PlonK-based ones and the Poseidon function family has been used in a number of projects, including Zcash <a href="#page-19-5">[HBHW22]</a>, the Dusk Network <a href="#page-19-6">[MKF21]</a> and Mina <a href="#page-18-7">[BMRS20]</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-2.4" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2.4 SNARKs arithmetizations</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Most SNARKs model NP relations as arithmetic circuits that are represented by systems of multivariate polynomial equations. More concretely, let Cx(w) := R(x, w) be a circuit parameterized by a statement x, which is satisfiable (on a certain input witness w) iff x belongs in the NP language induced by R. Circuit C<sup>x</sup> is modeled by a system of n multivariate polynomial equations f1(x, w) = 0 &and; . . . &and; fn(x, w) = 0 on variables x and w; in such a way that C<sup>x</sup> is satisfiable iff so is the system of equations. Variables x are so-called public inputs whereas variables w correspond to the witness of the NP relation. The proving system allows a prover to convince a verifier that they know an assignment on variables w that satisfies all polynomial equations when variables x are fixed to some public value that determines the statement being proven.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The specific details about how arithmetic circuits are transformed into polynomial constraints are known as the system's arithmetization. Different SNARKs impose different additional restrictions on the system of polynomial constraints. For example, Rank 1 Constraint Systems (R1CS) require that every polynomial f<sup>i</sup> be such that it can be factored into three linear polynomials  <span class="math">a_i</span> ,  <span class="math">b_i</span>  and  <span class="math">c_i</span>  as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$f_i(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{w}) = a_i(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{w}) b_i(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{w}) - c_i(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{w})</span>$
.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">On the other hand,  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span>  imposes the following restrictions (see Section 2.5):</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Each polynomial  <span class="math">f_i</span>  can involve on at most N different variables, where N is known as the gate architecture size. The original publication [GWC19] describes a wire architecture of N=3, but different values of N have been explored by several implementations of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span> , e.g., the Dusk Network uses N=4 [Dus21] and Mina uses N=15 wires [WS21].</li>
      <li>A polynomial  <span class="math">f_i</span>  can only contain monomials of a restricted form. The original version of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span>  allows for a constant monomial, any degree-1 monomial, and just one degree-2 monomial, but the set of supported monomials (or more generally, terms) may be extended with so-called <em>custom gates</em> [GW19].</li>
    </ul>

      <h3 id="sec-2.5" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2.5 <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span> 's arithmetization</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">From  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span>  constraint system. In the  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span>  proof system [GWC19], a constraint is a tuple (a, b, c, sels) where a, b, c are formal variables and sels is a set of so-called selectors. A selector is a circuit parameter used as a switch to activate a gate. Constraints are often represented in a matrix, with one row per constraint and a column for each selector, where the matrix values are the selector coefficients of each constraint.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the original version of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span> , the available selectors are  <span class="math">q_L,q_R,q_O</span> , adding the left, right and output wires (resp. a, b and c),  <span class="math">q_M</span> , multiplying two wires (a and b), and  <span class="math">q_C</span>  adding a public constant. As such, every constraint, induces a polynomial equation:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">
<span class="math">$q_{\\mathsf{L}} \\cdot \\mathsf{a} + q_{\\mathsf{R}} \\cdot \\mathsf{b} + q_{\\mathsf{O}} \\cdot \\mathsf{c} + q_{\\mathsf{M}} \\cdot \\mathsf{a} \\cdot \\mathsf{b} + q_{\\mathsf{C}} = 0 \\ . \\tag{1}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Such equation captures addition and multiplication gates, useful for modeling algebraic circuits. For example, an addition gate c = a + b can be modeled by setting  <span class="math">q_L = q_R = 1</span> ,  <span class="math">q_O = -1</span>  and  <span class="math">q_M = q_C = 0</span> . And a multiplication gate c = ab can be modeled as  <span class="math">q_M = 1</span> ,  <span class="math">q_O = -1</span>  and  <span class="math">q_L = q_R = q_C = 0</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To a polynomial equation. NP relations are converted it into algebraic circuits by modeling their satisfiability as sets of polynomial equations of the form (1), induced by  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span>  constraints  <span class="math">\\{(a_i,b_i,c_i,\\mathsf{sels}_i)\\}_{i\\in[n]}</span> . These constraints are then compiled into a single polynomial equation:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">
<span class="math">$(Q_l \\cdot A + Q_r \\cdot B + Q_o \\cdot C + Q_m \\cdot A \\cdot B + Q_c)(X) = 0 , \\qquad (2)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where polynomials A, B and C encode the <em>witness</em> to the NP relation and Q polynomials define the circuit and may be precomputed. The polynomials can be efficiently computed using iFFT as follows. Let  <span class="math">\\omega \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p</span>  be a primitive  <span class="math">2^k</span> -th root of unity, for some k such that  <span class="math">n &lt; 2^k</span> . Polynomial  <span class="math">Q_l</span>  is defined as the minimal polynomial that evaluates to  <span class="math">q_{L_i}</span>  on  <span class="math">\\omega^i</span> , for every  <span class="math">i \\in [n]</span> . (The rest of Q polynomials are defined analogously.) A  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span>  proof will be simply an argument of knowledge of polynomials A, B, C such that equation (2) holds when evaluated on  <span class="math">\\omega^i</span> , for every  <span class="math">i \\in [n]</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Defining  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span>  as a polynomial protocol. As such,  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span>  can be seen as a polynomial protocol in which a party proves the veracity of several polynomial identities on a witness in a subgroup. These identities are those induced by circuit's constraints, as well as those induced by copy-constraints (which check that the witness is consistent with the circuit structure) and potentially other ones by extra functionalities like  <span class="math">\\mathsf{P}look\\mathsf{up}</span>  or  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Turbo}\\text{-}\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span> . The prover computes then a new polynomial T by dividing a combination of all identities and the unitary smallest polynomial that vanishes on each point of the subgroup.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In practice, the proof is achieved by leveraging a polynomial commitment scheme [KZG10] as follows. The selectors and circuit-relative polynomials are committed in a preprocessing phase and made public (that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;1</sup> As we will see, extra selectors may be introduced for encoding complex functionalities more efficiently [GW19].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;2</sup> As well as other polynomial equalities relative to the so-called <em>copy-constraints</em> which we omit here for simplicity.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">way, the verifier only needs to handle the commitments to these polynomials, which are much more compact than the polynomials themselves). The prover also commits to the wire polynomials A, B, C (after, possibly, having added a blinding factor term to achieve zero-knowledge) and T. The prover is then challenged to evaluate all committed polynomials at a point &xi; &isin; Z<sup>p</sup> chosen uniformly at random.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The verifier will check the validity of the polynomial evaluations given by the prover at &xi;, and then use these evaluations to check that a certain polynomial identity is 0 at &xi;. This identity ensures that T has been computed correctly, which implies that all polynomials identities vanish in the subgroup, as desired.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Extending to arbitrary polynomials Turbo-PlonK. The Turbo-PlonK proposal is key in unlocking PlonK capabilities by allowing one to change PlonK's constraint equation <a href="#page-5-2">(1)</a> or even append another one to it. With this technique, one can view the selectors q<sup>L</sup> and so on as elementary gates that are added up to form an arithmetic identity. We can define new multivariate polynomials of any degree P(a, b, c), a new selector q<sup>P</sup> and add the expression q<sup>P</sup> &middot; P(a, b, c) to <a href="#page-5-2">(1)</a> and <a href="#page-5-3">(2)</a>. Another possibility offered by Turbo-PlonK is the addition of new identities. These identities, of the form I(a, b, c,sels) = 0, must also hold when evaluated on all &omega; i . They can be switched off by setting all selectors to 0. Several identities can share the same selectors, in which case additional identity-specific may be needed to switch identities. This new functionality can be of great help when checking different relations on the same variable or checking domain independent relations such as arithmetic and elliptic curve operations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One has to be careful when adding a new gate because it increases the prover and verifier costs. A specialized custom gate can drastically cut the cost of one component of a circuit, but may be less efficient than a more general purpose gate which could be reused. For example, adding the rather generic power of 5 gate, q<sup>x</sup> <sup>5</sup> , for the Poseidon circuit increases the prover cost by 1 to 2n group operations (c.f. Table <a href="#page-15-0">2)</a> but as it substantially decreases the number of constraints, from 624 to 464 constraints, the overall proving cost is reduced by &asymp; 10% (c.f. Table <a href="#page-15-1">1)</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Furthermore, because of FFT threshold effects, experimentation is often needed when choosing the most adequate custom gate. Hence, measuring the frequency usage of the associated selector can be helpful to determine the usefulness of a specific custom gate alongside the analysis of a custom gate's degree and complexity as well as the reduction in the number of constraints.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">3 New optimizations on PlonK's arithmetization</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A Turbo-PlonK constraint is simply a PlonK constraint inducing (possibly) more than one polynomial equality.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Definition 1 (Turbo-PlonK constraint). A Turbo-PlonK constraint is a tuple (a, b, c,sels) where a, b, c are formal variables and sels is a set of selectors. A selector is a pair q : &alpha;, where q is the selector's name and &alpha; &isin; Zp, its coefficient.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Definition 2 (Turbo-PlonK constraint system). A Turbo-PlonK constraint system is an ordered list of Turbo-PlonK constraints. There exists a function P that maps each pair of consecutive constraints into a set of polynomial equations (each corresponding to a so-called identity), involving the formal variables of both constraints, but whose coefficients depend only on the selectors of the first.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 2. One may ask why only the variables of a constraint and the next are involved in an equation. Why not the second next too? The reason is that accessing the next constraint variables comes &quot;for free&quot;. Indeed, PlonK's permutation argument requires evaluating the permutation polynomials on &xi;, but also on &xi;&omega;, which corresponds to the next constraint values. Accessing further values, e.g. two constraints away, is possible but would incur the additional cost (for both prover and verifier) of opening polynomial commitments at a new evaluation point, e.g. &xi;&omega;<sup>2</sup> , making these gates less practical.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As an example of a Turbo-PlonK custom gate, we can introduce a selector called qbin, with associated identity qbin a (a &minus; 1) = 0, to ensure that the first variable in a constraint is Boolean. That way, constraint (a, b, c, {q<sup>M</sup> : 1, q<sup>O</sup> : &minus;1, qbin : 1}) would model the fact that c = b or c = 0, ensured by the polynomial constraints (checked in parallel):</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$-c + ab = 0</span>$
and  <span class="math">a(a-1) = 0</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We can also extend the arithmetic identity by defining linear selectors referring to the next gate wires as:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">
<span class="math">$(a_i, b_i, c_i, \\{q_L, q_R, q_O, q_M, q_C, \\widetilde{q}_L, \\widetilde{q}_R, \\widetilde{q}_O\\}) , \\qquad (3)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">representing identity</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">
<span class="math">$q_{L} a_{i} + q_{R} b_{i} + q_{O} c_{i} + q_{M} a_{i} b_{i} + q_{C} + \\widetilde{q}_{L} a_{i+1} + \\widetilde{q}_{R} b_{i+1} + \\widetilde{q}_{O} c_{i+1} = 0 ,</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(4)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where ai+1, bi+1 and ci+1 refer to the next-constraint wires. Note that the polynomial equation induced by a constraint is no longer fully determined by the constraint itself, but also its relative position in the constraints system.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the rest of this work, we consider all arithmetic selectors from <a href="#page-7-1">(3)</a>, as well as an extra arithmetic selector q<sup>x</sup> <sup>5</sup> : &delta; that adds an extra term &delta; a 5 i to the identity from <a href="#page-7-2">(4)</a>. (This selector will be used to model Poseidon S-boxes with just 1 constraint.) Our results are generic with respect to other possible selectors whose identity runs in parallel.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-3.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.1 Optimizing Turbo-PlonK constraint systems</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We propose several ideas for optimizing a constraint system. In Section <a href="#page-8-0">3.2</a> we then present an automated mechanism, formalized as re-writing rules (Figure <a href="#page-9-0">3)</a>, that systematically applies these atomic optimizations.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-misc-1" class="text-2xl font-bold">Shared wires across constraints</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Two linear combinations that involve common wires can be implemented more efficiently if they are handled together. For example, a linear combination of the form out = &alpha;1x + &alpha;2y + &alpha;3z, would require two constraints to be implemented (over a 3-wires architecture), for example, as:<a href="#page-7-3">3</a></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">
<span class="math">$(x, y, \\mathsf{out}, \\{\\mathsf{q_L} : \\alpha_1, \\mathsf{q_R} : \\alpha_2, \\widetilde{\\mathsf{q}_L} : \\alpha_3, \\mathsf{q_O} : -1\\}) \\parallel (z, \\_, \\_, \\emptyset)</span>$
.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Now, imagine we needed to encode an extra linear combination that depends on the same x, y, z, say out&prime; = &beta;1x + &beta;2y + &beta;3z. (This situation could occur, e.g., when modelling a Poseidon linear gate.) We could model both linear combinations with 3 constraints instead of 4 as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(x,\\_,\\mathsf{out},\\{\\mathsf{q_L}:\\alpha_1,\\widetilde{\\mathsf{q}_L}:\\alpha_2,\\widetilde{\\mathsf{q}_R}:\\alpha_3,\\mathsf{q_O}:-1\\})\\parallel(y,z,\\mathsf{out}&#x27;,\\{\\mathsf{q_L}:\\beta_2,\\mathsf{q_R}:\\beta_3,\\widetilde{\\mathsf{q}_R}:\\beta_1,\\mathsf{q_O}:-1\\})\\parallel(\\_,x,\\_,\\emptyset)\\ . \\tag{5}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Furthermore, observe how, conveniently, some wires in the above constraints are unbound. This will be exploited in our next optimization.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-misc-2" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Merging constraints</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The use of next-constraint selectors can lead to constraints that have an empty set of selectors whose only purpose is to include wires that are used by the previous constraint. An example is the last constraint of <a href="#page-7-4">(5)</a>. Such constraints can be combined with other constraints if the wires are not in conflict. For example, two groups of (three) constraints as the one in <a href="#page-7-4">(5)</a> can be combined into simply one group of five:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>3</sup> We use symbol to express the fact that the variable is not being used by the selectors of this constraint or the previous constraint. In practice, any value could be put in the place of without affecting the induced system of equations. But we want to highlight that is a special symbol that refers to the fact that the variable is not used.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">(x_1,\\_,\\mathsf{out}_1,\\mathsf{sels}_1) \\parallel (y_1,z_1,\\mathsf{out}_1&#x27;,\\mathsf{sels}_1&#x27;) \\parallel (\\_,x_1,\\_,\\emptyset) \\text{ and } (x_2,\\_,\\mathsf{out}_2,\\mathsf{sels}_2) \\parallel (y_2,z_2,\\mathsf{out}_2&#x27;,\\mathsf{sels}_2&#x27;) \\parallel (\\_,x_2,\\_,\\emptyset) ,</span>  can be transformed into</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(x_1, \\_, \\mathsf{out}_1, \\mathsf{sels}_1) \\parallel (y_1, z_1, \\mathsf{out}_1&#x27;, \\mathsf{sels}_1&#x27;) \\parallel (x_2, x_1, \\mathsf{out}_2, \\mathsf{sels}_2) \\parallel (y_2, z_2, \\mathsf{out}_2&#x27;, \\mathsf{sels}_2&#x27;) \\parallel (\\_, x_2, \\_, \\emptyset)</span>$
.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Also, note that the order of constraints does not matter as long as they do not use the next-constraint selectors. Thus, we could conveniently reorder constraints to make the merging more effective.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-misc-3" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Gaussian elimination</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span>  constraints were initially designed for modelling gates of an arbitrary circuit. (That explains the legacy names of selectors  <span class="math">q_L</span> ,  <span class="math">q_R</span>  and  <span class="math">q_O</span> , standing for left, right and output wires, respectively.)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is advantageous to view constraints as the polynomial equalities that they induce and not think about what wires represent inputs and what wires represent outputs. That way, we can transform the polynomial equalities into an equivalent set of equalities that can be represented with simpler or fewer constraints. For example, imagine we want to compute  <span class="math">r := 8x^5 + 2y^5</span>  and  <span class="math">s := 4x^5 - 3y^5</span> . The naive approach would require introducing two auxiliary variables and a total of 4 Turbo- <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span>  constraints:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\begin{array}{ll} (x,\\_,\\mathsf{aux}_1,\\{\\mathsf{q_{x^5}}\\!:\\!1,\\mathsf{q_O}\\!:\\!-1\\}) &amp; (y,\\_,\\mathsf{aux}_2,\\{\\mathsf{q_{x^5}}\\!:\\!1,\\mathsf{q_O}\\!:\\!-1\\}) \\\\ (\\mathsf{aux}_1,\\mathsf{aux}_2,r),\\{\\mathsf{q_L}\\!:\\!8,\\mathsf{q_R}\\!:\\!2,\\mathsf{q_O}\\!:\\!-1\\}) &amp; (\\mathsf{aux}_1,\\mathsf{aux}_2,s),\\{\\mathsf{q_L}\\!:\\!4,\\mathsf{q_R}\\!:\\!-3,\\mathsf{q_O}\\!:\\!-1\\}) \\end{array}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Alternatively, we could simplify the polynomial equalities (trying to minimize the number of power-of-5 monomials) first by considering linear combinations between them. For example,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\begin{cases} 8x^5 + 2y^5 - r = 0 \\\\ 4x^5 - 3y^5 - s = 0 \\end{cases} \\iff \\begin{cases} 8x^5 + 2y^5 - r = 0 \\\\ -8y^5 - 2s + r = 0 \\end{cases} \\iff \\begin{cases} 32x^5 - 3r - 2s = 0 \\\\ -8y^5 - 2s + r = 0 \\end{cases}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Now, it is possible to model both equations with just two constraints, avoiding the use of auxiliary variables, as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(x, r, s, \\{q_{x5}: 32, q_R: -3, q_O: -2\\})</span>$
<span class="math">(y, r, s, \\{q_{x5}: -8, q_R: 1, q_O: -2\\})</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This idea will be used in Section 4 for building highly optimized full and partial Poseidon rounds.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-3.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.2 Automated optimizer of constraints</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We propose an automated mechanism for applying the techniques presented in the previous section in order to simplify constraint systems. This method is less error-prone and can lead to more effective optimizations than the manual application of the simplification rules, e.g., by combining separated parts of the circuit that are compatible. Nevertheless, specific manual optimizations for concrete parts of a circuit can result in very performant circuits as we will show in Section 4.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our techniques are specialized for a Turbo- <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}lon\\mathcal{K}</span>  design that includes the arithmetic identity from (4), but may include other arbitrary identities (as long as they use independent selectors).

    <p class="text-gray-300">The optimizer is particularly efficient for optimizing circuits that involve linear computations. For example, the naive implementation of the Poseidon circuit from Table <a href="#page-15-1">1</a> with w = 3 and N = 3, using an S-box custom gate requires 464 constraints. It can be reduced to just 272 constraints after our optimizer. (This is the same number of constraints that can be achieved with N = 4, but without the need of a fourth wire per gate.) Our prototype implementation is open source <a href="#page-19-20">[Nom22c]</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-4.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.1 Optimized implementation of Poseidon</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We present an optimized Turbo-PlonK modelization of Poseidon for with w = 3. Our techniques can be generalized to other versions, see the discussion at the end of this section. We model (shifted) full rounds with 4 constraints where the last one has no selectors and is compatible with its successor. On the other hand, we can leverage the linear skip and model 4 (shifted) partial rounds with just 7 constraints where the last is compatible with its successor. Consequently we are effectively modeling every full round with 3 constraints and every partial round with 1.5 constraints.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-4.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.2 Linear skip</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A naive implementation of Poseidon Hash would require including constraints that model w additions (of w terms) for every (full or partial) round; and constraints modelling w S-boxes (per full round) plus one S-box per partial round.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We propose an optimization, coined the linear skip, which can be used to reduce the number of constraints modelling partial rounds. In a nutshell, we leverage the fact that the composition of linear functions is again a linear function in order to &quot;skip&quot; the evaluation of certain wires.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Consider Figure <a href="#page-11-0">4,</a> describing the application of two Poseidon partial rounds to state (x1, . . . , xw), transforming it into state (z1, . . . , zw). First observe that equations <a href="#page-11-1">(7)</a> and <a href="#page-11-2">(11)</a> could be ignored since b<sup>i</sup> (respectively di) can be used as an alias for a<sup>i</sup> (respectively ci), for all i &isin; [w&minus;1].

    <p class="text-gray-300">The linear trick consists of also ignoring equations (9) and (10), not creating variables nor constraints for wires  <span class="math">y_i</span>  and  <span class="math">c_i</span>  for any  <span class="math">i \\in [w-1]</span> . (Note that we must keep a variable for  <span class="math">c_w</span> , which is the input to an S-box.) This way, the constraints modelling a pair of partial rounds can be reduced to:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">That is,  <span class="math">M&#x27; = (\\alpha&#x27;_{ij})</span>  is the result of multiplying the submatrix of M without the last column by the submatrix of M without the last row.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Instead of having to perform 2w additions of w terms to model the pair of partial rounds, the linear skip allows us to model them with simply 1 addition of w terms and w additions of w+1 terms.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Multiple skips Observe that the above technique can be generalized to skipping multiple partial rounds. However, skipping too many rounds can be counterproductive, because the required sums become heavier as the number of skips increases. In particular, skipping n partial rounds would require 1 addition of w+i terms for every  <span class="math">i=0,\\ldots,n-1</span> ; plus w extra additions of w+n terms. This can be more expensive than simply computing the (n+1)w additions of w terms for modelling the n+1 partial rounds with the naive approach. Figure 5 presents a comparison of the amortized number of additions per partial round between different choices of the skip size n. For every n and every register size w, we display  <span class="math">t_{n,w}/(n+1)</span> , where  <span class="math">t_{n,w}</span>  is the number of additions necessary to model n+1 partial rounds when skipping n of them:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Observe that the optimal number of skips will depend on the register size w, but also on the constraint system that is being used, since some systems can handle several additions per constraint.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Modelling (shifted) full rounds We present in Figure 6 the structure of a shifted full round. Observe that modelling a shifted full round involves capturing the constraints  <span class="math">\\mathbf{y} = M\\mathbf{x}^5 + \\mathbf{\\kappa}</span> , or equivalently (moving everything to the left-hand side of the equation and multiplying by the inverse of M),  <span class="math">M^{-1}\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{x}^5 - M^{-1}\\mathbf{\\kappa} = 0</span> . Let  <span class="math">M^{-1} = (\\beta_{ij})</span> . We can model the above equations with the following constraints:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\begin{array}{llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Furthermore, observe how the last constraint (with no selectors) is compatible with the first constraint of the next shifted full round.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Other projects have opted for further modifications of PlonK including extra identities. For example, Zcash <a href="#page-20-2">[Zca21]</a> defines specialized custom gates for full and partial rounds which allows them to model a Poseidon iteration with R<sup>P</sup> + R<sup>F</sup> + 1 constraints (65 constraints if we set R<sup>P</sup> = 56 and R<sup>F</sup> = 8). Another example is Mina <a href="#page-20-1">[WS21]</a>, that opted for using an architecture of N = 15 wires per gate and defines a very specialized custom gate to model 5 full rounds in one constraint, which allows them to implement a Poseidon iteration in R<sup>F</sup> /5 constraints (their implementation only includes full rounds). Although these models introduce a significant overhead on the prover, the considerable reduction on the number of constraints pays off. However, contrary to the simple extensions we have considered in Table <a href="#page-15-1">1,</a> the models adopted by Zcash and Mina introduce a notable overhead on the verifier too. This is acceptable for their use case, since</p>

However, these models are incomparable to those considered in this paper, where we focus on plain PlonK verifiers.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-5.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5.2 Optimized Poseidon on CPU</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The linear skip essentially decreases the number of additions and multiplications in partial rounds, and it can be exploited to build a very efficient implementation of Poseidon on CPU. We provide an OCaml script, available in Mec <a href="#page-19-22">[Nom21]</a>, that computes the number of additions and multiplications for a given instance of Poseidon and a given number of skipped partial rounds. (As we argue in Figure <a href="#page-12-0">5</a> there is an optimal number of skipped rounds after which skipping more rounds will be counterproductive.) Note that the linear skip introduces a negligible additional memory cost.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A C implementation of HADES over the scalar field of BLS12-381 is available under the MIT license in <a href="#page-19-23">[Nom22a]</a>. The implementation supports any security parameters and any number of skipped rounds. It uses the library blst <a href="#page-20-8">[Sup21]</a> <a href="#page-16-0">10</a> as a backend for arithmetic operations. The constants are loaded next to the state in a contiguous C array to take advantage of the CPU cache.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Table <a href="#page-16-1">3</a> we present a comparison between the number of operations and execution time of different Poseidon instantiations considering different skip sizes. All experiments were performed on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8565U CPU @ 1.80GHz. We present average times in microseconds of each experiment running for 2 seconds. Standard deviations are in the order of tens of nanoseconds. Our implementation uses the C via FFI through an OCaml binding, but this introduces a negligible overhead.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We conclude that the linear skip can reduce the total execution time by a factor of 13% in the case of w = 3 or 35% with w = 5, when compared with the naive implementation with no skips.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">6 Conclusions</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We have shown how simple, yet powerful, optimization techniques make it possible to express circuits in the most basic Turbo-PlonK model very compactly, whose number of constraints is comparable to the one obtained through more complex and expensive custom gates. Our automated optimizer of constraints, implemented in a prototype which is publicly available as open source, allows users to focus on the circuit design and obtain efficient implementations while avoiding error-prone and complex manual optimizations. This way, the construction of circuits can be more transparent and easier to audit.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our techniques have led to the most efficient and compact implementations of the Poseidon circuit in the Turbo-PlonK model with basic custom gates such as q<sup>x</sup> <sup>5</sup> and next-constraint linear selectors. Other projects, such as the Dusk Network could benefit from our techniques (in particular the linear skip) to reduce the number of constraints of their Hades implementation <a href="#page-18-9">[Dus21]</a> by at least a factor of 25% for free (without any modifications of their model or additional custom gates). Furthermore, we believe our techniques nicely complement other works that aim at reducing the number of constraints by exploring additional PlonK identities and more complex custom gates <a href="#page-20-1">[WS21,</a> <a href="#page-20-2">Zca21]</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>10</sup> Optimizations for AVX supported architectures are implemented. The benchmark values in Table<a href="#page-16-1">-3</a> enjoy these optimizations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">An appealing direction for future work would be to explore additional heuristics and optimizer rules that can capture our most advanced optimizations presented in Section <a href="#page-10-1">4.</a> Also, it would be very interesting to explore whether our techniques can be extended to other arithmetizations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We are very thankful to Marc Beunardeau, Victor Dumitrescu, Antonio Locascio, Marina Polubelova and Marco Stronati for very fruitful discussions about this project and for all their help and feedback.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof (of Theorem 1). Let  <span class="math">(\\Gamma, L)</span>  be an admissible extended constraint system and let  <span class="math">(\\Gamma&#x27;, L&#x27;)</span>  be the result of applying any of the rules from Figure 3 to  <span class="math">(\\Gamma, L)</span> . Then,  <span class="math">(\\Gamma&#x27;, L&#x27;)</span>  is admissible. Furthermore,  <span class="math">(\\Gamma, L)</span>  is satisfiable if and only if  <span class="math">(\\Gamma&#x27;, L&#x27;)</span>  is satisfiable.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We focus on every rule individually.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Collect linear. Since the last constraint of  <span class="math">\\Gamma_0</span>  does not contain next-constraint selectors, we have that  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}(\\Gamma_0 \\parallel (x_1, x_2, x_3, \\{\\mathsf{q_L} : \\alpha_1, \\mathsf{q_R} : \\alpha_2, \\mathsf{q_O} : \\alpha_3, \\mathsf{q_C} : \\alpha_0\\}) \\parallel \\Gamma_1)</span>  is equal to  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}(\\Gamma_0) \\cup \\mathcal{P}(\\Gamma_1) \\cup \\{\\alpha_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\alpha_i x_i = 0\\}</span> , and  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}(\\Gamma_0 \\parallel \\Gamma_1) = \\mathcal{P}(\\Gamma_0) \\cup \\mathcal{P}(\\Gamma_1)</span> , from which the result follows immediately.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Free variable. Say  <span class="math">\\boldsymbol{x}</span>  is a satisfying assignment for  <span class="math">(\\Gamma, L)</span> , since L contains equation  <span class="math">\\alpha_0 + \\sum_{i \\in S} \\alpha_i x_i = 0</span>  with  <span class="math">\\alpha_j \\neq 0</span> , and it is satisfied by  <span class="math">\\boldsymbol{x}</span> , it must be  <span class="math">x_j = -(\\alpha_0 + \\sum_{i \\in S \\setminus \\{j\\}} \\alpha_i x_i) \\div \\alpha_j</span> , so  <span class="math">\\boldsymbol{x}</span>  must also be a satisfying assignment for  <span class="math">(\\Gamma, L[x_j \\mapsto -(\\alpha_0 + \\sum_{i \\in S \\setminus \\{j\\}} \\alpha_i x_i) \\div \\alpha_j])</span> . Observe that  <span class="math">\\Gamma = \\Gamma&#x27;</span> , so  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}(\\Gamma) = \\mathcal{P}(\\Gamma&#x27;)</span> . On the other hand, if  <span class="math">\\boldsymbol{x}&#x27;</span>  is a satisfying assignment for  <span class="math">(\\Gamma&#x27;, L&#x27;)</span> , because  <span class="math">x_j</span>  is not in  <span class="math">\\Gamma&#x27;</span>  (and not in L'), we have that  <span class="math">\\boldsymbol{x}&#x27;</span>  modified so that  <span class="math">x_j := -(\\alpha_0 + \\sum_{i \\in S \\setminus \\{j\\}} \\alpha_i x_i) \\div \\alpha_j</span>  is a satisfying assignment for  <span class="math">(\\Gamma&#x27;, L&#x27; \\cup \\{\\alpha_0 + \\sum_{i \\in S} \\alpha_i x_i\\})</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Efficient sum. Since  <span class="math">\\Gamma</span>  is admissible, its last constraint does not include next-constraint selectors. In that case,  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}(\\Gamma) \\cup L</span>  equals  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}(\\Gamma&#x27;) \\cup L&#x27;</span>  as desired.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Auxiliary variable. If x is a satisfying assignment of  <span class="math">t_1 + t_2 = 0</span> , then  <span class="math">x, s \\mapsto t_1</span>  is a satisfying assignment for  <span class="math">t_1 - s = 0</span>  and  <span class="math">s + t_2 = 0</span> . On the other hand, if  <span class="math">t_1 - s = 0</span>  and  <span class="math">s + t_2 = 0</span>  are satisfiable at the same time, by adding both equations,  <span class="math">t_1 + t_2 = 0</span>  must also be satisfiable.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Constraint rule. Note that L = L' and for any  <span class="math">t \\in \\mathsf{ConstraintRules}</span>  we have  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}(\\mathsf{g} \\| \\Gamma_1) = \\mathcal{P}(t(\\mathsf{g}) \\| \\Gamma_1)</span>  which implies that  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}(\\Gamma_0 \\| \\mathsf{g} \\| \\Gamma_1) = \\mathcal{P}(\\Gamma_0 \\| t(\\mathsf{g}) \\| \\Gamma_1)</span>  given that  <span class="math">\\Gamma_0</span>  is admissible, as desired.</p>

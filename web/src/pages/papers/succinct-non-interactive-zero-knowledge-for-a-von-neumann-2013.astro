    <h6 id="sec-2" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Abstract</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We build a system that provides succinct non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) for program executions on a von Neumann RISC architecture. The system has two components: a cryptographic proof system for verifying satisfiability of arithmetic circuits, and a circuit generator to translate program executions to such circuits. Our design of both components improves in functionality and efficiency over prior work, as follows.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our circuit generator is the first to be universal: it does not need to know the program, but only a bound on its running time. Moreover, the size of the output circuit depends <em>additively</em> (rather than multiplicatively) on program size, allowing verification of larger programs.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The cryptographic proof system improves proving and verification times, by leveraging new algorithms and a pairing library tailored to the protocol.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We evaluated our system for programs with up to <span class="math">10{,}000</span> instructions, running for up to <span class="math">32{,}000</span> machine steps, each of which can arbitrarily access random-access memory; and also demonstrated it executing programs that use <em>just-in-time compilation</em>. Our proofs are <span class="math">230</span> bytes long at <span class="math">80</span> bits of security, or <span class="math">288</span> bytes long at <span class="math">128</span> bits of security. Typical verification time is 5 milliseconds, regardless of the original program’s running time.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">1 Introduction</p>

    <h3 id="sec-4" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1.1 Goal</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Consider the setting where a client owns a public input <span class="math">x</span>, a server owns a private input <span class="math">w</span>, and the client wishes to learn <span class="math">z:=F(x,w)</span> for a program <span class="math">F</span> known to both parties. For instance, <span class="math">x</span> may be a query, <span class="math">w</span> a confidential database, and <span class="math">F</span> the program that executes the query on the database.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Security. The client is concerned about <em>integrity</em> of computation: how can he ascertain that the server reports the correct output <span class="math">z</span>? In contrast, the server is concerned about <em>confidentiality</em> of his own input: how can he prevent the client from learning information about <span class="math">w</span>?</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Cryptography offers a powerful tool to address these security concerns: <em>zero-knowledge proofs</em> <em>[x11]</em>. The server, acting as the prover, attempts to convince the client, acting as the verifier, that the following NP statement is true: “there exists <span class="math">w</span> such that <span class="math">z=F(x,w)</span>”. Indeed:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>[leftmargin=*]</li>

      <li>The <em>soundness</em> property of the proof system guarantees that, if the NP statement is false, the prover cannot convince the verifier (with high probability). Thus, soundness addresses the client’s integrity concern.</li>

      <li>The <em>zero-knowledge</em> property of the proof system guarantees that, if the NP statement is true, the prover can convince the verifier without leaking any information about <span class="math">w</span> (beyond was is leaked by the output <span class="math">z</span>).</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Thus, zero knowledge addresses the server’s confidentiality concern.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Moreover, the client sometimes not only seeks soundness but also <em>proof of knowledge</em> <em>[x11, x5]</em>, which guarantees that, whenever he is convinced, not only can he deduce that a witness <span class="math">w</span> exists, but also that the server <em>knows</em> one such witness. This stronger property is often necessary to security if <span class="math">F</span> encodes cryptographic computations, and is satisfied by most zero-knowledge proof systems.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Efficiency. Besides the aforementioned security desiderata, many settings also call for <em>efficiency</em> desiderata. The client may be either unable or unwilling to engage in lengthy interactions with the server, or to perform large computations beyond the “bare minimum” of sending the input <span class="math">x</span> and receiving the output <span class="math">z</span>. For instance, the client may be a computationally-weak device with intermittent connectivity (e.g., a smartphone).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">zk-SNARKs. A proof system achieving the above security and efficiency desiderata is called a (publicly-verifiable) <em>zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledge</em> (zk-SNARK). zk-SNARK constructions can be applied to a wide range of security applications, provided these constructions deliver good enough <em>efficiency</em>, and support rich enough <em>functionality</em> (i.e., the class of programs <span class="math">F</span> that is supported).</p>

    <h6 id="sec-5" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Remark 1.1.</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the zero-knowledge setting above, the client does not have the server’s input, and so cannot conduct the computation on his own. Hence, it is <em>not meaningful</em> to compare “efficiency of outsourced computation at the server” and “efficiency of native execution at the client”, because the latter was never an option. Non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (and zk-SNARKs) are useful regardless of <em>cross-over points</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our goal in this paper is to construct</p>

    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-600 pl-4 my-4 text-gray-400 italic">
      <p><em>a zk-SNARK implementation supporting executions on a universal von Neumann RISC machine.</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3 id="sec-6" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1.2 Prior work</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">zk-SNARKs. Many works have obtained zk-SNARK constructions <em>[x12, x17, x10, x1, x11, x13, x14, BFRS^{+}13]</em>. Three of these <em>[x21, x2, BFRS^{+}13]</em> provide implementations, and thus we briefly recall them. Parno et al. <em>[x21]</em> present two main contributions.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>A zk-SNARK, with essentially-optimal asymptotics, for arithmetic circuit satisfiability, based on <em>quadratic arithmetic programs</em> (QAPs) <em>[x11]</em>. They accompany their construction with an implementation.</li>

      <li>A compiler that maps C programs with fixed memory accesses and bounded control flow (e.g., array accesses and loop iteration bounds are compile-time constants) into corresponding arithmetic circuits.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Ben-Sasson et al. <em>[x3]</em> present three main contributions.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>Also a QAP-based zk-SNARK with essentially-optimal asymptotics for arithmetic circuit satisfiability, and a corresponding implementation. Their construction follows the linear-interactive proofs of <em>[x2]</em>.</li>

      <li>A simple RISC architecture, TinyRAM, along with a circuit generator for generating arithmetic circuits that verify correct execution of TinyRAM programs.</li>

      <li>A compiler that, given a C program, produces a corresponding TinyRAM program.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Thus, both <em>[x22, x3]</em> have two main components: a zk-SNARK for a low-level language, and method to translate a high-level language to the low-level language. Finally, Braun et al. <em>[BFRS^{+}13]</em> re-implemented the protocol of <em>[x22]</em> and combined it with a circuit generator that incorporates memory-checking techniques <em>[x4]</em> to support random-access memory <em>[x2]</em>.</p>

    <h5 id="sec-7" class="text-base font-semibold mt-4">Outsourcing computation to powerful servers.</h5>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Numerous works <em>[x23, SMBW12, SVPB^{+}12, SBVB^{+}13, x10, x24, x25, x26, x27]</em> seek to verifiably outsource computation to untrusted powerful servers, e.g., in order to make use of cheaper cycles or storage. (See Appendix A for a summary.) We stress that verifiable outsourcing of computations <em>is not our goal</em>. Rather, as mentioned, we study functionality and efficiency aspects of <em>non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs</em>, which are useful even when applied to relatively-small computations, and even with high overheads.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Compared to most protocols to outsource computations, known zk-SNARKs use “heavyweight” techniques, such as <em>probabilistically-checkable proofs</em> <em>[x5]</em> and expensive pairing-based cryptography. The optimal choice of protocol, and whether it actually pays off compared to local <em>native execution</em>, are complex, computation-dependent questions <em>[x29]</em>, and we leave to future work the question of whether zk-SNARKs are useful for the goal of outsourcing computations.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-8" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1.3 Limitations of prior work on zk-SNARKs</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Recent work has made tremendous progress in taking zk-SNARKs from asymptotic theory into concrete implementations. Yet, known implementations suffer from several limitations.</p>

    <h5 id="sec-9" class="text-base font-semibold mt-4">Per-program key generation.</h5>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As in any non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, a zk-SNARK requires a one-time trusted setup of public parameters: a <em>key generator</em> samples a proving key (used to generate proofs) and a verification key (used to check proofs). However, current zk-SNARK implementations <em>[x22, x3]</em> require the setup phase to depend on the program <span class="math">F</span>, which is <em>hard-coded</em> in the keys. Key generation is costly (quasilinear in <span class="math">F</span>’s runtime) and is thus difficult to amortize if conducted anew for each program. More importantly, per-program key generation requires, <em>for each new choice of program</em>, a trusted party’s help.</p>

    <h5 id="sec-10" class="text-base font-semibold mt-4">Limited support for high-level languages.</h5>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Known circuit generators have limited functionality or efficiency: (i) <em>[x22]</em>’s circuit generator only supports programs without data dependencies, since memory accesses and loop iteration bounds cannot depend on a program’s input; (ii) <em>[BFRS^{+}13]</em>’s circuit generator allows data-dependent memory accesses, but each such access requires expensive hashing to verify Merkle-tree authentication paths; (iii) <em>[x3]</em>’s circuit generator supports arbitrary programs but its circuit size scales inefficiently with program size (namely, it has size <span class="math">\\Omega(\\ell T)</span> for <span class="math">\\ell</span>-instruction <span class="math">T</span>-step TinyRAM programs). Moreover, while there are techniques that mitigate some of the above limitations <em>[x30]</em>, these only apply in special cases, and not do address general data dependencies, a common occurrence in many programs.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Ultimately, large general programs rely on external libraries (providing, e.g., mathematical subroutines or data structures), which contribute to program size. Thus, it is crucial to seek circuits that *simultaneously</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">support arbitrary programs and that efficiently scale with program size.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Generic sub-algorithms. The aforementioned zk-SNARKs use several sub-algorithms, and in particular elliptic curves and pairings. Protocol-specific optimizations are a key ingredient in fast implementations of pairing-based protocols [Sco05], yet prior implementations only utilize off-the-shelf cryptographic libraries, and miss key optimization opportunities.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We present two main contributions: a new circuit generator and a new zk-SNARK for circuits. These can be used independently, or combined to obtain an overall system.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We design and build a new circuit generator that incorporates the following two main improvements.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(1) Our circuit generator is universal: when given input bounds  <span class="math">\\ell, n, T</span> , it produces a circuit that can verify the execution of any program with  <span class="math">\\leq \\ell</span>  instructions, on any input of size  <span class="math">\\leq n</span> , for  <span class="math">\\leq T</span>  steps. Instead, all prior circuit generators  <span class="math">[\\mathrm{SVPB}^{+}12, \\mathrm{SBVB}^{+}13, \\mathrm{PGHR13}, \\mathrm{BCGTV13a}, \\mathrm{BFRS}^{+}13]</span>  hardcoded the program in the circuit. Combined with a zk-SNARK for circuits (or any NP proof system for circuits), we achieve a notable conceptual advance: once-and-for-all key generation that allows verifying all programs up to a given size. This removes major issues in all prior systems: expensive per-program key generation, and the thorny issue of conducting it anew in a trusted way for every program.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our circuit generator supports a universal machine that, like modern computers, follows the von Neumann paradigm (program and data lie in the same read/write address space). Concretely, it supports a von Neumann RISC architecture called vnTinyRAM, a modification of TinyRAM [BCGTV13b]. Thus, we also support programs leveraging techniques such as just-in-time compilation or self-modifying code [GESA+09, RP06].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To compile C programs to the vnTinyRAM machine language, we ported the GCC compiler to this architecture, building on the work of [BCGTV13a].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">See Figure 1 for a functionality comparison with prior circuit generators (for details, see  <span class="math">\\mathrm{[BFRS^{+}13,\\S 2]}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">expect, and find, that such circuit generators perform better than ours for programs that are already "close to a circuit", and worse for programs rich in data-dependent memory accesses and control flow.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our third contribution is a high-performance implementation of a zk-SNARK for arithmetic circuits.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(3) We improve upon and implement the protocol of Parno et al. [PGHR13]. Unlike previous zk-SNARK implementations [PGHR13, BCGTV13a,  <span class="math">\\mathrm{BFRS}^{+}13</span> ], we do not use off-the-shelf cryptographic libraries. Rather, we create a tailored implementation of the requisite components: the underlying finite-field arithmetic, elliptic-curve group arithmetic, pairing-based checks, and so on.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To facilitate comparison with prior work, we instantiate our techniques for two specific algebraic setups: we provide an instantiation based on Edwards curves [Edw07] at 80 bits of security (as in [BCGTV13a]), and an instantiation based on Barreto-Naehrig curves [BN06] at 128 bits of security (as in [PGHR13,  <span class="math">\\mathrm{BFRS}^{+}13</span> ]).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">On our reference platform (a typical desktop), proof verification is fast: at 80-bit security, for an  <span class="math">n</span> -byte input to the circuit, verification takes  <span class="math">4.7 + 0.0004 \\cdot n</span>  milliseconds, regardless of circuit size; at 128-bit security, it takes  <span class="math">4.8 + 0.0005 \\cdot n</span> . The constant term dominates for small inputs, and corresponds to the verifier's pairing-based checks; in both cases, it is less than half the time for separately evaluating the 12 requisite pairings of the checks. We achieve this saving by merging parts of the pairings' computation in a protocol-dependent way — another reason for a custom implementation of the underlying math.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Key generation and proof generation entail a per-gate cost. For example, for a circuit with 16 million gates: at 80 bits of security, key generation takes  <span class="math">81\\mu \\mathrm{s}</span>  per gate and proving takes  <span class="math">109\\mu \\mathrm{s}</span>  per gate; at 128 bits of security, these per-gate costs mildly increase to  <span class="math">100\\mu \\mathrm{s}</span>  and  <span class="math">144\\mu \\mathrm{s}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As in previous zk-SNARK implementations, proofs have constant size (independent of the circuit or input size); for us, they are 230 bytes at 80 bits of security, and 288 bytes at 128 bits of security.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Compared to previous implementations of zk-SNARKs for circuits [PGHR13, BCGTV13a,  <span class="math">\\mathrm{BFRS}^{+}13</span> ], our implementation improves both proving and verification times, e.g., see Figure 3.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 3: Comparison with prior zk-SNARKs for a 1-million-gate arithmetic circuit and a 1000-bit input, running on our benchmarking machine, using software provided by the respective authors. Since  <span class="math">\\mathrm{[BFRS^{+}13]}</span>  is a re-implementation of [PGHR13], we only include the latter's performance. ( <span class="math">N = 5</span>  and std  <span class="math">&amp;lt; 2\\%</span> )</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our new circuit generator and our new zk-SNARK for circuits can be used independently. For instance, the circuit generator can (up to interface matching) replace the circuit generators in  <span class="math">\\mathrm{[SVPB^{+}12, SBVB^{+}13,}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">PGHR13, BCGTV13a,  <span class="math">\\mathrm{BFRS}^{+}13]</span> , thus granting these systems universality: once-and-for-all key generation. Similarly, our zk-SNARK for circuits can replace the underlying zk-SNARKs in [PGHR13, BCGTV13a,  <span class="math">\\mathrm{BFRS}^{+}13]</span> , or be used directly in applications where a suitable circuit is already specified.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Combining these two components, we obtain a full system: a  <span class="math">zk</span> -SNARK for proving/verifying correctness of vnTinyRAM computations; see Figure 4 and Figure 5 for diagrams of this system. We evaluated this overall system for programs with up to 10,000 instructions, running for up to 32,000 steps. Verification time is, again, only few milliseconds, independent of the running time of the vnTinyRAM program, even when program size and input size are kilobytes. Proofs, as mentioned, have a small constant size. Key generation and proof generation entail a per-cycle cost, with a dependence on program size that "tapers off" as computation length increases. For instance, at 128-bit security and vnTinyRAM with a word size of 32 bits, key generation takes 210 ms per cycle and proving takes 100 ms per cycle, for 8K-instruction programs.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">!<a href="img-0.jpeg">img-0.jpeg</a> Figure 4: Offline phase (once). The key generator outputs a proving key and verification key, for proving and verifying correctness of any program execution meeting the given bounds.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">JIT case study: efficient memcpy. Besides evaluating individual components, we give an example demonstrating the rich functionality supported by the integrated system. We wrote a vnTinyRAM implementation of memcpy that leverages just-in-time compilation (in particular, dynamic loop unrolling) to require fewer cycles. While ours is a simple case study, just-in-time compilation is a widely-used powerful technique with many applications, e.g., increasing the performance of interpreted programming languages such as JavaScript in web browsers [GESA+09] or Python [RP06]. As the efficiency of zk-SNARK implementations improves, more and more of these applications will become feasible.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_{1}</span> and <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_{2}</span> be two cyclic groups of order <span class="math">r</span>.

    <h2 id="sec-23" class="text-2xl font-bold">2.6 A von Neumann RISC architecture</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Ben-Sasson et al. [BCGTV13a] introduced TinyRAM, a Harvard RISC architecture with word-addressable memory. We modify TinyRAM to obtain vnTinyRAM, which differs from it in two main ways. First, vnTinyRAM follows the von Neumann paradigm, whereby program and data are stored in the same read-write address space; programs may use runtime code generation. Second, vnTinyRAM has byte-addressable memory, along with instructions to load/store bytes or words.<span class="math">^{5}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Besides the above main differences, vnTinyRAM is very similar to TinyRAM. Namely, it is parametrized by the word size, denoted <span class="math">W</span>, and the number of registers, denoted <span class="math">K</span>. The CPU state of the machine consists of (i) a <span class="math">W</span>-bit program counter; (ii) <span class="math">K</span> general-purpose <span class="math">W</span>-bit registers; (iii) a 1-bit condition flag. The full state of the machine also includes memory, which is a linear array of <span class="math">2^{W}</span> bytes, and two tapes, each with a string of <span class="math">W</span>-bit words, and read-only in one direction. One tape is for a primary input <span class="math">\\aleph</span> and the other for an auxiliary input <span class="math">\\mathfrak{w}</span> (treated as nondeterministic, untrusted advice).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In memory, an instruction is represented as a double word (one word for an immediate, and another for opcode, etc.). Thus, a program <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> is a list of address/double-word pairs specifying the initial contents of memory; all other memory locations assume the initial value of 0.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">At every time step, the machine executes the instruction encoded by pc-th double word in memory, where pc is program counter pc (with its lowest <span class="math">2W/8</span> set to 0); every instruction increments pc by <span class="math">2W/8</span> (which is number of bytes in a double word), unless it explicitly modifies pc. The machine’s only input is via the input tapes and initial memory, and only output is via an answer instruction (which halts execution) having a single argument <span class="math">A</span>, representing the return value, where <span class="math">A = 0</span> means “accept”.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Language of accepting computations. Formally, when saying “prover/verify correct execution” we mean “membership in the language of accepting computations”. This language is defined as follows.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Definition 2.7. Fix bounds <span class="math">\\ell, n, T</span>. The language <span class="math">\\mathcal{L}_{\\ell, n, T}</span> consists of pairs <span class="math">(\\mathbb{P}, \\aleph)</span> such that: (i) <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> is a program with <span class="math">\\leq \\ell</span> instructions, (ii) <span class="math">\\aleph</span> is a primary input with <span class="math">\\leq n</span> words, (iii) there exists an auxiliary input <span class="math">\\mathfrak{w}</span> s.t. <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}(\\aleph, \\mathfrak{w})</span> accepts in <span class="math">\\leq T</span> steps.

Regardless, Theorem 3.2 in fact holds for <em>any</em> field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span>, but the construction, when <span class="math">\\mathrm{char}(\\mathbb{F})\\leq 2^{2W}</span>, is more complex, and our code does not currently support it.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-28" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.1 Past techniques</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Most of the difficulties that arise when designing a circuit generator have to do with <em>data dependencies</em>. A circuit’s topology does not depend on its inputs but, in contrast, program flow and memory accesses depend on the choice of program and the program’s inputs. Thus, a circuit tasked with verifying program executions must be “ready” to support a multitude of program flows and memory accesses, despite the fact that its topology has already been fixed. Various techniques have been applied to the design of circuit generators.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Program analysis. In the extreme, if both the program <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> and its inputs <span class="math">(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{w})</span> are known in advance, designing a circuit generator is simple: construct a circuit that evaluates <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> on <span class="math">(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{w})</span> by preparing the circuit’s topology to match the pre-determined program flow and memory accesses. But now suppose that only <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> is known in advance, but not its inputs <span class="math">(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{w})</span>. In this case, by analyzing <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> piece by piece (e.g., separately examine the various loops, branches, and so on), one could try to design a circuit <span class="math">C_{\\mathbb{P}}</span> that can handle different choices of inputs. Most prior circuit generators <em>[SVPB^{+}12, SBVB^{+}13, PGHR13, BFRS^{+}13]</em> take this approach.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, this approach suffers from several limitations. First, the class of supported programs <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> is not rich, because support for data dependencies is limited. E.g., <em>[PGHR13]</em> requires array accesses and loop iteration bounds to be compile-time constants; also, while <em>[BFRS^{+}13]</em> supports data-dependent memory accesses, most program flow is also restricted to be known (or bounded) at compile-time; mitigations are possible, but only in special cases <em>[x21]</em>. Second, and more importantly, this approach does not seem to allow for designing universal circuit generators, because the program <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> is <em>not known in advance</em> and thus there is no program to analyze.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-29" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Multiplex every access.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Computers are universal random-access machines (RAMs), so one approach of designing a universal circuit is to mimic a computer’s execution, building a layered circuit as follows. The <span class="math">i</span>-th layer contains the entire state of the machine (CPU state and random-access memory) at time step <span class="math">i</span>, and layer <span class="math">i+1</span> is computed from it by evaluating the transition function of the machine, handling any accesses to memory via multiplexing. While this approach supports arbitrary program flow, memory accesses are inefficiently supported; indeed, if memory has <span class="math">S</span> addresses, the resulting circuit is huge: it has size <span class="math">\\Omega(TS)</span>.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-30" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Nondeterministic routing.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Ben-Sasson et al. <em>[x1]</em> suggested using <em>nondeterministic routing</em> on a Beneš network to support memory accesses efficiently; indeed, sorting and routing are ubiquitous techniques in fast simulation results between nondeterministic models of computation <em>[x11, x23, x13, x12]</em>. Our circuit generator builds on the techniques of <em>[x1, x2]</em>, so we briefly review the main idea behind nondeterministic routing.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Following <em>[x1]</em>, Ben-Sasson et al. <em>[x2]</em> introduced a simple computer architecture, called TinyRAM, and constructed a routing-based circuit generator for TinyRAM. They define the following notions. A <em>CPU state</em>, denoted <span class="math">S</span>, is the CPU’s contents (e.g., program counter, registers, flags) at a given time step. An <em>execution trace</em> for a program <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span>, time bound <span class="math">T</span>, and primary input <span class="math">\\mathtt{x}</span> is a sequence <span class="math">\\mathtt{tr}=(S_{1},\\ldots,S_{T})</span> of CPU states. An execution trace <span class="math">\\mathtt{tr}</span> is <em>valid</em> if there is an auxiliary input <span class="math">\\mathtt{w}</span> such that the execution trace induced by <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> running on inputs <span class="math">(\\mathtt{x},\\mathtt{w})</span> is <span class="math">\\mathtt{tr}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We seek an arithmetic circuit <span class="math">C</span> for verifying that <span class="math">\\mathtt{tr}</span> is valid. We break this down by splitting validity into three sub-properties: (i) <em>validity of instruction fetch</em> (for each time step, the correct instruction is fetched); (ii) <em>validity of instruction execution</em> (for each time step, the fetched instruction is correctly executed); and (iii) <em>validity of memory accesses</em> (each load from an address retrieves the value of the last store to that address).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The first two properties are verified as follows. Construct a circuit <span class="math">C_{\\mathbb{P}}</span> so that, for any two CPU states <span class="math">S</span> and <span class="math">S^{\\prime}</span>, <span class="math">C_{\\mathbb{P}}(S,S^{\\prime},g)</span> is satisfied for some “guess” <span class="math">g</span> if and only if <span class="math">S^{\\prime}</span> can be reached from <span class="math">S</span> (by fetching from <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> the instruction indicated by the program counter in <span class="math">S</span> and then executing it), for <em>some</em> state of memory. Then, properties (i) and (ii) hold if <span class="math">C_{\\mathbb{P}}(S_{i},S_{i+1},\\cdot)</span> is satisfiable for <span class="math">i=1,\\ldots,T-1</span>. Thus, <span class="math">C</span> contains <span class="math">T-1</span> copies of <span class="math">C_{\\mathbb{P}}</span>, each wired to a pair of adjacent states in <span class="math">\\mathtt{tr}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The third property is verified via nondeterministic routing. Assume that <span class="math">C</span> also gets as input <span class="math">\\mathsf{MemSort}(\\mathtt{tr})</span>, which equals to the sorting of <span class="math">\\mathtt{tr}</span> by accessed memory addresses (breaking ties via timestamps), and write a circuit <span class="math">C_{\\mathsf{mem}}</span> so that validity of memory accesses holds if <span class="math">C_{\\mathsf{mem}}</span> is satisfied by each pair of adjacent states in <span class="math">\\mathsf{MemSort}(\\mathtt{tr})</span>. (Roughly, <span class="math">C_{\\mathsf{mem}}</span> checks consistency of “load-after-load”, “load-after-store”, and so on.) However, <span class="math">C</span> merely gets some auxiliary input <span class="math">\\mathtt{tr}^{<em>}</span>, which </em>purports<em> to be <span class="math">\\mathsf{MemSort}(\\mathtt{tr})</span>. So <span class="math">C</span> works as follows: (a) <span class="math">C</span> has <span class="math">T-1</span> copies of <span class="math">C_{\\mathsf{mem}}</span>, each wired to a pair of adjacent states in <span class="math">\\mathtt{tr}^{</em>}</span>; (b) <span class="math">C</span> separately verifies that <span class="math">\\mathtt{tr}^{<em>}=\\mathsf{MemSort}(\\mathtt{tr})</span> by routing on a <span class="math">O(T\\log T)</span>-node Beneš network. The switches of the routing network are set according to non-deterministic guesses (i.e., additional values in the auxiliary input), and the routing network merely </em>verifies<em> that the switch settings induce a permutation; this allows for a very tight reduction. (Known constructions that </em>compute<em> the correct permutation hide large constants in big-oh notation </em>[x1]*.)</p>

    <h4 id="sec-31" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Past inefficiencies.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">After filling in additional details, the construction of <em>[x1]</em> reviewed above gives a circuit of size <span class="math">\\Theta\\big{(}(n+T)\\cdot(\\log(n+T)+\\ell)\\big{)}=\\Omega(\\ell\\cdot T)</span>. The <span class="math">\\Omega(\\ell\\cdot T)</span> arises from the fact that all of the <span class="math">\\ell</span> instructions in <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> are <em>hardcoded</em> into each of the <span class="math">T-1</span> copies of <span class="math">C_{\\mathbb{P}}</span>. Thus, besides being non-universal, the circuit scales inefficiently as <span class="math">\\ell</span> grows (e.g., for <span class="math">\\ell=10^{4}</span>, <span class="math">C_{\\mathbb{P}}</span>’s size is already dominated by <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span>’s size).</p>

    <h3 id="sec-32" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.2 Our construction</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In comparison to <em>[x1]</em>, our circuit generator is universal and, moreover, its size only grows with <span class="math">\\ell+T</span> (additive dependence on program size) instead of with <span class="math">\\ell\\cdot T</span> (multiplicative dependence). As our evaluation demonstrates (see Section 5.1), the size improvement actually translates into significant savings in practice.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Instead of hardcoding the program <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> into each copy of the circuit <span class="math">C_{\\mathbb{P}}</span>, we follow the von Neumann paradigm, where the program <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> lies in the same read/write memory space as data. We ensure that <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> is loaded into the initial state of memory, using a dedicated circuit; we then verify instruction fetch via the <em>same</em> routing network that is used for checking data loads/stores. While the idea is intuitive, realizing it involves numerous technical difficulties, some of which are described below.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-33" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Routing instructions and data.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We extend an execution trace to not only include CPU states but also instructions: <span class="math">\\text{\\,tr}=(S_{1},I_{1},\\ldots,S_{T},I_{T})</span> where <span class="math">S_{i}</span> is the <span class="math">i</span>-th CPU state, and <span class="math">I_{i}</span> is the <span class="math">i</span>-th executed instruction. We seek an arithmetic circuit <span class="math">C</span> that checks <span class="math">\\text{\\,tr}</span>, in this “extended” format, for the same three properties as above: (i) <em>validity of instruction fetch</em>; (ii) <em>validity of instruction execution</em>; (iii) <em>validity of memory accesses</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As in <em>[x1]</em>, checking that <span class="math">\\text{\\,tr}</span> satisfies property (ii) is quite straightforward. Construct a circuit <span class="math">C_{\\text{\\,exe}}</span> so that, given two CPU states <span class="math">S,S^{\\prime}</span> and an instruction <span class="math">I</span>, <span class="math">C_{\\text{\\,exe}}(S,S^{\\prime},I,g)</span> is satisfied, for some guess <span class="math">g</span>, if and only if <span class="math">S^{\\prime}</span> can be reached from <span class="math">S</span>, by executing <span class="math">I</span>, for some state of memory. Then, <span class="math">C</span> contains <span class="math">T-1</span> copies of <span class="math">C_{\\text{\\,exe}}</span>, each wired to adjacent CPU states and an instruction, i.e., the <span class="math">i</span>-th copy is <span class="math">C_{\\text{\\,exe}}(S_{i},S_{i+1},I_{i},g_{i})</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Unlike <em>[x1]</em>, though, we verify properties (i) and (iii) jointly, via the same routing network. The auxiliary input now contains <span class="math">\\text{\\,tr}^{<em>}=(A_{1},\\ldots,A_{2T})</span>, purportedly equal to the memory-sorted list of </em>both<em> instructions fetches and CPU states. (Since the program <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> lies in the same read-write memory as data, an instruction fetch from <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> is merely a special type of memory load.) Thus, to check that <span class="math">\\text{\\,tr}</span> satisfies properties (i) and (iii), we design <span class="math">C</span> to (a) verify that <span class="math">\\text{\\,tr}^{</em>}=\\text{\\,MemSort}(\\text{\\,tr})</span> via nondeterministic routing, and (b) verify validity of all (i.e., instruction and data) memory accesses, via a new circuit <span class="math">C^{\\prime}_{\\text{\\,mem}}</span> applied to each pair of adjacent items <span class="math">A_{i},A_{i+1}</span> in <span class="math">\\text{\\,tr}^{*}</span>. Thus, in this approach, <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> is never replicated <span class="math">T</span> times; rather, the fetching of its instructions is verified together with all other memory accesses, one instruction fetch at a time.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-34" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Multiple memory-access types.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Each copy of <span class="math">C^{\\prime}_{\\text{\\,mem}}</span> inspects a pair of items in <span class="math">\\text{\\,tr}^{<em>}</span> and (assuming <span class="math">\\text{\\,tr}^{</em>}=\\text{\\,MemSort}(\\text{\\,tr})</span>) must ensure consistency of “load-after-load”, “load-after-store”, and so on. However, unlike in <em>[x1]</em>, the byte-addressable memory of vnTinyRAM is accessed in <em>different-sized</em> blocks: instruction-size blocks for instruction fetch; word-size blocks when loading/storing words; and byte-size blocks when loading/storing bytes. The consistency checks in <span class="math">C^{\\prime}_{\\text{\\,mem}}</span> must handle “aliasing”, i.e., accesses to the same point in memory via different addresses and block sizes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We tackle this difficulty as follows. Double-word blocks are the largest blocks in which memory is accessed (as instructions are encoded as double words; cf. Section 2.6). We thus let each item in <span class="math">\\text{\\,tr}^{*}</span> always specify a double-word, even if the item’s memory access was with respect to a smaller-sized block (e.g., word or byte). With this modification, we can let <span class="math">C^{\\prime}_{\\text{\\,mem}}</span> perform consistency checks “at the double-word level”, and handling word/byte accesses by mapping them to double-word accesses with suitable shifting and masking.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-35" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Booting the machine.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We have so far assumed that the program <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span>, given as input to <span class="math">C</span>, <em>already</em> appears in memory. However, the circuit <span class="math">C</span> sketched so far only verifies the validity of <span class="math">\\text{\\,tr}</span> with respect to a machine whose memory is initialized to <em>some</em> state, corresponding to the execution of <em>some</em> program. But <span class="math">C</span> must verify correct execution of, specifically, <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span>, and so it must also verify that memory is initialized to contain <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span>. Since <span class="math">C</span> does not explicitly maintain memory (not even the initial one) and only implicitly reasons about memory via the routing network, it is not clear how <span class="math">C</span> can perform this check.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We tackle this difficulty as follows. We further modify the the execution trace <span class="math">\\text{\\,tr}</span>, by extending it with an initial <em>boot</em> section, preceding the beginning of the computation, during which the input program <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> is stored into memory, one instruction <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}_{i}</span> at a time. This extends the length of both <span class="math">\\text{\\,tr}</span> and <span class="math">\\text{\\,tr}^{<em>}</span> from <span class="math">2T</span> to <span class="math">\\ell+2T</span>, for <span class="math">\\ell</span>-instruction programs, and introduces a new type of item, “boot input store”, in <span class="math">\\text{\\,tr}^{</em>}</span>. Similarly, the routing network is now responsible for routing <span class="math">\\ell+2T</span>, rather than <span class="math">2T</span>, packets.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-36" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Further optimizations.</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The above construction sketch (depicted in Figure 6) is only intuitive, and does not discuss other optimizations that ultimately yield the performance that we report in Section 5.1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For example, while <em>[x1]</em> rely on Beneš networks, we rely on <em>arbitrary-size Waksman networks</em> <em>[x2]</em>, which only require <span class="math">N(\\log N-0.91)</span> switches to route <span class="math">N</span> packets, instead of <span class="math">2^{\\lceil\\log N\\rceil}(\\lceil\\log N\\rceil-0.5)</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Besides being closer to the information-theoretic lower bound of  <span class="math">N(\\log N - 1.443)</span> , such networks eliminate costly rounding effects in [BCGTV13a], where the size of the network is doubled if  <span class="math">N</span>  is just above a power of 2 (since the height of a Beneš network is  <span class="math">2^{\\lceil \\log N \\rceil}</span> ).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As another example, we want  <span class="math">C</span>  to not only support programs with exactly  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  instructions but also with at most  <span class="math">\\ell</span> , and similarly for the bound  <span class="math">n</span>  on the size of primary inputs (which our discussion has so far omitted); we work out the details for  <span class="math">C</span>  to efficiently support such upper bounds.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Compiling to vnTinyRAM. To enable verification of higher-level programs, written in C, we ported the GCC compiler to the vnTinyRAM architecture, by modifying the Harvard-architecture, word-addressible TinyRAM C compiler of [BCGTV13a]. Given a C program, written in the same subset of C as in [BCGTV13a], the compiler produces the initial memory map representing a program  <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> . This also served to validate the vnTinyRAM architectural choices (e.g., the move to byte-addressing significantly, and added instructions, improved efficiency for many programs).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">!<a href="img-2.jpeg">img-2.jpeg</a> Figure 6: Outline of our universal circuit construction with the extended trace tr on the left and (allegedly) its memory sort  <span class="math">\\mathrm{tr}^*</span>  on the right. All inputs to the circuit, with the exception of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span>  (and the primary input  <span class="math">\\mathbf{x}</span> , not shown), are nondeterministic guesses.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We discuss our second main contribution: a high-performance implementation of a zk-SNARK for arithmetic circuit satisfiability. Our approach is to tailor the requisite mathematical algorithms to the specific zk-SNARK protocol at hand. While our techniques can be instantiated in many algebraic setups and security levels, we demonstrate them in two specific settings, to facilitate comparison with prior work. Later, in Section 5.2, we provide benchmarks for our zk-SNARK.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">See Section 2.5 for an informal definition of a zk-SNARK for arithmetic circuit satisfiability. We improve upon and implement the zk-SNARK of Parno et al. [PGHR13]. For completeness the "PGHR protocol" is summarized in Figure 10, which provides pseudocode for its key generator  <span class="math">G</span> , prover  <span class="math">P</span> , and verifier  <span class="math">V</span> . The construction is based on QAPs, introduced in Section 2.3.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Like most other zk-SNARKs, the PGHR protocol relies on a pairing, which is specified by a prime  <span class="math">r \\in \\mathbb{N}</span> , three cyclic groups  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1, \\mathbb{G}_2, \\mathbb{G}_T</span>  of order  <span class="math">r</span> , and a bilinear map  <span class="math">e \\colon \\mathbb{G}_1 \\times \\mathbb{G}_2 \\to \\mathbb{G}_T</span> . (See Section 2.4.)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A pairing is typically instantiated via a pairing-friendly elliptic curve. Concretely, suppose that one uses a curve <span class="math">E</span> defined over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q}</span>, with embedding degree <span class="math">k</span> with respect to <span class="math">r</span>, to instantiate the pairing. Then <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_{T}</span> is set to <span class="math">\\mu_{r}</span>, the subgroup of <span class="math">r</span>-th roots of unity in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}^{<em>}</span>. The instantiation of <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_{1}</span> and <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_{2}</span> depends on the choice of <span class="math">e</span>; typically, <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_{1}</span> is instantiated as an order-<span class="math">r</span> subgroup of <span class="math">E(\\mathbb{F}_{q})</span>, while, for efficiency reasons </em>[x1, x2]*, <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_{2}</span> as an order-<span class="math">r</span> subgroup of <span class="math">E^{\\prime}(\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k/d}})</span> where <span class="math">E^{\\prime}</span> is a <span class="math">d</span>-th twist of <span class="math">E</span>. Finally, the pairing <span class="math">e</span> is typically a two-stage function <span class="math">e(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{Q}):=\\mathsf{FE}(\\mathsf{ML}(\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{Q}))</span>, where <span class="math">\\mathsf{ML}\\colon\\mathbb{G}_{1}\\times\\mathbb{G}_{2}\\to\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{k}</span> is known as Miller loop, and <span class="math">\\mathsf{FE}\\colon\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{k}\\to\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{k}</span> is known as final exponentiation and maps <span class="math">\\alpha</span> to <span class="math">\\mathsf{FE}(\\alpha):=\\alpha^{(q^{k}-1)/r}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As mentioned, we instantiate our techniques based on two different curves: an Edwards curve for the 80-bit security level (as in <em>[x3]</em>) and a Barreto–Naehrig curve for the 128-bits security level (as in <em>[x22, BFRS^{+}13]</em>). We selected both the Edwards curve and Barreto–Naehrig curve so that <span class="math">r-1</span> has high 2-adic order (i.e., <span class="math">r-1</span> is divisible by a large power of <span class="math">2</span>), because this was shown to improve the efficiency of the key generator and the prover <em>[x3]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Next, we describe the optimizations that we have applied to the zk-SNARK verifier (Section 4.2), then to the prover (Section 4.3), and, finally, to the key generator (Section 4.4).</p>

    <h3 id="sec-39" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.2 An optimized verifier</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The verifier <span class="math">V</span> takes as input a verification key <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}</span>, input <span class="math">\\vec{x}\\in\\mathbb{F}_{r}^{n}</span>, and proof <span class="math">\\pi</span>, and checks if <span class="math">\\pi</span> is a valid proof for the statement “<span class="math">\\vec{x}\\in\\mathcal{L}_{C}</span>”. The computation of <span class="math">V</span> consists of two parts. First, use <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}_{\\mathsf{IC},0},\\ldots,\\mathsf{vk}_{\\mathsf{IC},n}\\in\\mathbb{G}_{1}</span> (part of <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}</span>) and input <span class="math">\\vec{x}</span> to compute <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}_{\\vec{x}}:=\\mathsf{vk}_{\\mathsf{IC},0}+\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{\\mathsf{i}}\\mathsf{vk}_{\\mathsf{IC},i}</span>(see Step 1 in Figure 10c). Second, use <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}</span>, <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}_{\\vec{x}}</span>, and <span class="math">\\pi</span>, to compute <span class="math">12</span> pairings and perform the required checks(see Step 2, Step 3, Step 4 in Figure 10c). In other words, <span class="math">V</span> performs <span class="math">O(n)</span> scalar multiplications in <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_{1}</span>, followed by <span class="math">O(1)</span> pairing evaluations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With regard to <span class="math">V</span>’s first part, variable-base multi-scalar multiplication techniques can be used to reduce the number of <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_{1}</span> operations needed to compute <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}_{\\vec{x}}</span> <em>[x3, x22]</em>. With regard to <span class="math">V</span>’s second part, even if the pairing evaluations take constant time (independent of the input size <span class="math">n</span>), these evaluations are very expensive and dominate for small <span class="math">n</span>. Our focus here is to minimize the cost of these pairing evaluations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">When only making “black-box” use of a pairing, the verifier must evaluate <span class="math">12</span> pairings(see Figure 10c),amounting to <span class="math">12</span> Miller loops plus <span class="math">12</span> final exponentiations. The straightforward approach is to compute these using a generic high-performance pairing library. We proceed differently: we obtain high-performance implementations of sub-components of a pairing, and then tailor their use specifically to <span class="math">V</span>’s protocol.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Namely, first, we obtain state-of-the-art implementations of a Miller loop and final exponentiation. We utilize optimal pairings <em>[x27]</em> to minimize the number of loop iterations in each Miller loop, and, to efficiently evaluate each Miller loop, rely on the formulas of <em>[x1]</em> (for Edwards curves) and <em>[BGDMO^{+}10]</em> (for BN curves). As for final exponentiation, we use multiple techniques to speed it up: <em>[x29, x13, x12, x14]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Next, building on the above foundation, we incorporate in <span class="math">V</span> the following optimizations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(1) Sharing Miller loops and final exponentiations. The verifier <span class="math">V</span> computes two products of two pairings(see Step 3 and Step 4 in Figure 10c).We leverage the fact that a product of pairings can be evaluated faster than evaluating each pairing separately and then multiplying the results <em>[x28, x30, x13, x26]</em>. Concretely, in a product of <span class="math">m</span> pairings, the Miller loop iterations for evaluating each factor can be carried out in “lock-step” so to share a single Miller accumulator variable, using one <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}</span> squaring per loop instead of <span class="math">m</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In a similar vein, one can perform a single final exponentiation on the product of the outputs of the <span class="math">m</span> Miller loops, instead of <span class="math">m</span> final exponentiations and then multiplying the results. In fact, since the output of the pairing can be inverted for free (as the element is unitary so that inverting equals conjugating <em>[x28]</em>), the idea of “sharing” final exponentiations extends to a ratio of pairing products. Thus, in the verifier we only need to perform <span class="math">5</span>, instead of <span class="math">12</span>, final exponentiations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our implementation incorporates both of the above techniques. For example, at the 80-bit security level, separately computing <span class="math">12</span> optimal pairings costs <span class="math">13.6</span> ms, but the above techniques reduce the time to only</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">8.1 ms. We decrease this further as discussed next.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(2) Precomputation by processing the verification key. Of the 12 pairings the verifier needs to evaluate, only one is such that both of its inputs come from the proof  <span class="math">\\pi</span> . The other 11 pairings have one fixed input, either a generator of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1</span>  or  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span> , or coming from the verification key  <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Whenever one of the two inputs to a pairing is fixed, precomputation techniques apply [GHS02, BLS03, Sco07], especially in the case when the fixed input is the base point in Miller's algorithm. In  <span class="math">V</span> , this holds for 9 out of the 11 pairing evaluations. We thus split the verifier's computation into an offline phase, which consists of a one-time precomputation that only depends on  <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}</span> , and a many-time online phase, which depends on the precomputed values, input  <span class="math">\\vec{x}</span> , and proof  <span class="math">\\pi</span> . More precisely, the result of the offline phase is a processed verification key  <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}^<em></span> . While  <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}^</em></span>  is longer than  <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}</span> , it allows the online phase to be faster.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">E.g., at the 80-bit security level,  <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}^*</span>  decreases the total cost of pairing checks from  <span class="math">8.1\\mathrm{ms}</span>  to  <span class="math">4.7\\mathrm{ms}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The prover  <span class="math">P</span>  takes as input a proving key  <span class="math">\\mathsf{pk}</span>  (which includes the circuit  <span class="math">C\\colon \\mathbb{F}_r^n\\times \\mathbb{F}_r^h\\to \\mathbb{F}_r^l</span> ), input  <span class="math">\\vec{x}\\in \\mathbb{F}_r^n</span> , and witness  <span class="math">\\vec{a}\\in \\mathbb{F}_r</span> . The prover  <span class="math">P</span>  is tasked to produce a proof  <span class="math">\\pi</span> , attesting that  <span class="math">\\vec{x}\\in \\mathcal{L}_C</span> . The computation of  <span class="math">P</span>  consists of two main parts. First, compute the coefficients  <span class="math">\\vec{h}</span>  of the polynomial  <span class="math">H(z)\\coloneqq \\frac{A(z)B(z) - C(z)}{Z(z)}</span>  (see Step 4 in Figure 10b), where  <span class="math">A,B,C\\in \\mathbb{F}_r[z]</span>  are derived from the QAP instance  <span class="math">(\\vec{A},\\vec{B},\\vec{C},Z)\\coloneqq \\mathsf{QAPinst}(C)</span>  and QAP witness  <span class="math">\\vec{s}\\coloneqq \\mathsf{QAPwit}(C,\\vec{x},\\vec{a})</span> . Second, use the coefficients  <span class="math">\\vec{h}</span> , QAP witness  <span class="math">\\vec{s}</span> , and public key  <span class="math">\\mathsf{pk}</span>  to compute  <span class="math">\\pi</span>  (see Step 6 in Figure 10b).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With regard to the first part of  <span class="math">P</span> , the coefficients  <span class="math">\\vec{h}</span>  can be efficiently computed via FFT techniques [BCGTV13a, PGHR13]; our implementation follows [BCGTV13a], and leverages the high 2-adic order of  <span class="math">r - 1</span>  for both of the elliptic curves we use. With regard to  <span class="math">P</span> 's second part, computing  <span class="math">\\pi</span>  requires solving large instances of the following problem: given elements  <span class="math">\\mathcal{Q}_1, \\ldots, \\mathcal{Q}_n</span>  all in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1</span>  (or all in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span> ) and scalars  <span class="math">\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_n \\in \\mathbb{F}_r</span> , compute  <span class="math">\\langle \\vec{\\alpha}, \\vec{\\mathcal{Q}} \\rangle \\coloneqq \\alpha_1 \\mathcal{Q}_1 + \\dots + \\alpha_n \\mathcal{Q}_n</span> . Previous work [PGHR13, BCGTV13a] has leveraged generic multi-scalar multiplication to compute  <span class="math">\\pi</span> . We observe that these algorithms can be tailored to the specific scalar distributions arising in  <span class="math">P</span> . In  <span class="math">P</span> , the vector  <span class="math">\\vec{\\alpha}</span>  is one of two types: (i)  <span class="math">\\vec{\\alpha} \\in \\mathbb{F}_r^{d+1}</span>  and represents the coefficients of the degree-  <span class="math">d</span>  polynomial  <span class="math">H</span> ; or (ii)  <span class="math">\\vec{\\alpha} = (1 \\circ \\vec{s} \\circ \\delta_1 \\circ \\delta_2 \\circ \\delta_3) \\in \\mathbb{F}_r^{4+m}</span> , for random  <span class="math">\\delta_1, \\delta_2, \\delta_3 \\in \\mathbb{F}_r</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In case i, the entries in of  <span class="math">\\vec{\\alpha}</span>  are random-looking. We use the Bos-Coster algorithm [BC89] due to its lesser memory requirements (as compared to, e.g., [Pip80]). We follow [BDLSY11]'s suggestions and achieve an assembly-optimized heap to implement the Bos-Coster algorithm.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In case ii, the entries in  <span class="math">\\vec{s}</span>  depend on the input  <span class="math">(C,\\vec{x},\\vec{a})</span>  to QAPwit; in turn,  <span class="math">(C,\\vec{x},\\vec{a})</span>  depends on our circuit generator (Section 3). Using the above algorithm "as is" is inefficient: the algorithm works well when all the scalars have roughly the same bit complexity, but the entries in  <span class="math">\\vec{c}</span>  have very different bit complexity. Indeed,  <span class="math">\\vec{\\alpha}</span>  equals to  <span class="math">\\vec{s}</span>  augmented with a few entries; and  <span class="math">\\vec{s}</span> , the QAP witness, can be thought of as the list of wire values in  <span class="math">C</span>  when computing on  <span class="math">(\\vec{x},\\vec{a})</span> ; the bit complexity of a wire value depends on whether it is storing a boolean value, a word value, and so on. We observe that there are only a few "types" of values, so that the entries of  <span class="math">\\vec{\\alpha}</span>  can be clustered into few groups of scalars with approximately the same bit complexity; we then apply the algorithm of [BC89] to each such group.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The key generator  <span class="math">G</span>  takes as input a circuit  <span class="math">C\\colon \\mathbb{F}_r^n\\times \\mathbb{F}_r^h\\to \\mathbb{F}_r^l</span> , and is tasked to compute a proving key  <span class="math">\\mathsf{pk}</span>  and a verification key  <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}</span> . The computation of  <span class="math">G</span>  consists of two main parts. First, evaluate each  <span class="math">A_{i},B_{i},C_{i}</span>  at</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">a random element <span class="math">\\tau</span>, where <span class="math">(\\vec{A},\\vec{B},\\vec{C},Z):=\\mathsf{QAPinst}(C)</span> is the QAP instance. Second, use these evaluations to compute <span class="math">\\mathsf{pk}</span> and <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}</span> (see Step 3 and Step 4 in Figure 10a).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With regard to <span class="math">G</span>'s first part, we follow [BCGTV13a] and again leverage the fact that <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_r</span> has a primitive root of unity of large order. With regard to <span class="math">G</span>'s second part, it is dominated by the cost of computing <span class="math">\\mathsf{pk}</span>, which requires solving large instances of the following problem: given an element <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}</span> in <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1</span> or <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span> and scalars <span class="math">\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_n\\in \\mathbb{F}_r</span>, compute <span class="math">\\alpha_{1}\\mathcal{P},\\ldots,\\alpha_{n}\\mathcal{P}</span>. Previous work [PGHR13, BCGTV13a], used fixed-base windowing [BGMW93] to efficiently compute such fixed-base multi-scalar multiplications.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In our implementation, we achieve additional efficiency, in space rather than in time. Specifically, we leverage a structural property of QAPs derived from arithmetic circuits, in order to reduce the size of the proving key <span class="math">\\mathsf{pk}</span>, as we now explain. Lemma 2.4 states that an <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span>-arithmetic circuit <span class="math">C\\colon \\mathbb{F}^n\\times \\mathbb{F}^h\\to \\mathbb{F}^t</span>, with <span class="math">\\alpha</span> wires and <span class="math">\\beta</span> gates, can be converted into a corresponding QAP of size <span class="math">m = \\alpha</span> and degree <span class="math">d\\approx \\beta</span> over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span>. Roughly, this is achieved in two steps. First, construct three matrices <span class="math">\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B},\\mathbf{C}\\in \\mathbb{F}^{(m + 1)\\times d}</span> that encode <span class="math">C</span>'s topology: for each <span class="math">j\\in [d]</span>, the <span class="math">j</span>-th column of <span class="math">\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B}</span> respectively encodes the "left" and "right" coefficients of the <span class="math">j</span>-th bilinear gate in <span class="math">C</span>, while the <span class="math">j</span>-th column of <span class="math">\\mathbf{C}</span> encodes the coefficients of the gate's output. Second, letting <span class="math">S\\subset \\mathbb{F}</span> be a set of size <span class="math">d</span>, define <span class="math">Z(z)\\coloneqq \\prod_{\\omega \\in S}(z - \\omega)</span> and, for <span class="math">i\\in \\{0,\\dots ,m\\}</span>, let <span class="math">A_{i}</span> be the low-degree extension of the <span class="math">i</span>-th row of <span class="math">\\mathbf{A}</span>; similarly define each <span class="math">B_{i}</span> and <span class="math">C_i</span>. All prior QAP-based zk-SNARK implementations exploit the fact that columns in the matrices <span class="math">\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B},\\mathbf{C}</span> are very sparse.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In contrast, we also leverage a different kind of sparsity: we observe that it is common for entire rows of <span class="math">\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B},\\mathbf{C}</span> to be all zeroes, causing the corresponding low-degree extensions to be zero polynomials. For instance, our circuit generator typically outputs a circuit for which the percentage of non-zero polynomials in <span class="math">\\vec{A},\\vec{B},\\vec{C}</span> is only about <span class="math">52\\%</span>, <span class="math">15\\%</span>, <span class="math">71\\%</span> respectively. The fact that many polynomials in <span class="math">\\vec{A},\\vec{B},\\vec{C}</span> evaluate to zero can be used towards reducing the size of <span class="math">\\mathsf{pk}</span>, by switching from a dense representation to a sparse one.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In fact, we have engineered our circuit generator to reduce the number of non-zero polynomials in <span class="math">\\vec{B}</span> as much as possible, because computations associated to evaluations of <span class="math">\\vec{B}</span> are conducted with respect to more expensive <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span> arithmetic, which we want to avoid as much as possible.⁸</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We evaluated our system on a desktop computer with a 3.40 GHz Intel Core i7-4770 CPU (with Turbo Boost disabled) and 32 GB of RAM. All experiments, except the largest listed in Figure 8 and Figure 9, used a small fraction of the RAM. For the two largest experiments in Figure 9 we added a Crucial M4 solid state disk for swap space. Finally, while our code supports multi-threading, we ran all of our experiments in single-thread mode, for ease of comparison with prior work.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Section 3 we described our universal circuit generator; we now benchmark its performance.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Parameter choices. The circuit generator supports the architecture vnTinyRAM, which is parametrized by two quantities: the word size <span class="math">W</span> and the number of registers <span class="math">K</span> (see Section 2.6). We report performance for a machine with <span class="math">K = 16</span> registers, and two choices of word size: <span class="math">W = 16</span> and <span class="math">W = 32</span>. Also, a circuit generator is defined relative to a prime field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> (see Definition 3.1) and its efficiency may in principle depend on <span class="math">p</span>; since our construction has the same number of gates for any <span class="math">p</span> with <span class="math">p &amp;gt; 2^{2W}</span> (a condition that holds for any cryptographically-large <span class="math">p</span>), in the discussion below we do not have to worry about the value of <span class="math">p</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">⁷ E.g., if the <span class="math">i</span>-th wire never appears with a non-zero coefficient as the "left" input of a bilinear gate, then the <span class="math">i</span>-th row of <span class="math">\\mathbf{A}</span> is zero, and thus <span class="math">A_i</span> is the zero polynomial.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">⁸ Moreover, 15% non-zero polynomials in <span class="math">\\vec{B}</span> is likely not optimal: one can verify that minimizing the number of non-zero polynomials in <span class="math">\\vec{B}</span> reduces to a minimum vertex cover problem [MR96]. It is an interesting open question whether approximation algorithms for such a problem can be used to further improve efficiency, and go below 15%.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">5.2 Performance of our zk-SNARK for circuit satisfiability</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Section 4 we described our zk-SNARK implementation; we now benchmark its performance.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Methodology. We provide performance characteristics for each of the zk-SNARK algorithms, <span class="math">G</span>, <span class="math">P</span> and <span class="math">V</span>, at the 80-bit and 128-bit security levels. We benchmark the system as follows.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(1) The key generator <span class="math">G</span> takes as input an arithmetic circuit <span class="math">C\\colon\\mathbb{F}_{r}^{n}\\times\\mathbb{F}_{r}^{h}\\to\\mathbb{F}_{r}^{l}</span>. Its efficiency mostly depends on the number of gates and wires in <span class="math">C</span>, because these affect the size and degree of the corresponding QAP (see Lemma 2.4). Thus, we evaluate <span class="math">G</span> on a circuit with <span class="math">2^{i}</span> gates and <span class="math">2^{i}</span> wires for <span class="math">i\\in\\{10</span>,<span class="math">12,\\ldots</span>,<span class="math">24\\}</span> (and fixed <span class="math">n=h=l=100</span>). In Figure 8 we report the resulting running times and key sizes, as per-gate costs.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(2) The prover <span class="math">P</span> takes as input a proving key <span class="math">\\mathsf{pk}</span>, input <span class="math">\\vec{x}\\in\\mathbb{F}_{r}^{n}</span>, and witness <span class="math">\\vec{a}\\in\\mathbb{F}_{r}^{h}</span>. Its efficiency mostly depends on the number of gates and wires in <span class="math">C</span> (the circuit used to generate <span class="math">\\mathsf{pk}</span>); we thus evaluate <span class="math">P</span> on the proving keys output by <span class="math">G</span>, for the same circuits as above. In Figure 8 we report the resulting running times, as per-gate costs, and (constant) proof sizes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(3) The verifier <span class="math">V</span> takes as input a verification key <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}</span>, input <span class="math">\\vec{x}\\in\\mathbb{F}_{r}^{n}</span>, and proof <span class="math">\\pi</span>. Its efficiency depends only on <span class="math">\\vec{x}</span> (since the size of <span class="math">\\vec{x}</span> determines that of <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}</span>). Thus, we evaluate <span class="math">V</span> on a random input <span class="math">\\vec{x}\\in\\mathbb{F}_{r}^{n}</span> of <span class="math">2^{i}</span> bytes for <span class="math">i\\in\\{2</span>,<span class="math">4,\\ldots</span>,<span class="math">20\\}</span>. In Figure 8 we report the resulting running times, along with corresponding key sizes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For completeness, Figure 12 in Appendix C reports the unnormalized measurements and additional information (e.g., times for various subcomputations).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Discussion. The data demonstrates that our zk-SNARK implementation works and scales as expected, as long as sufficient memory is available (e.g., on a desktop computer with 32GB of DRAM: up to <span class="math">16</span> million gates); also, as expected, the higher security level entails higher costs. Key generation takes about <span class="math">10</span> ms per gate of <span class="math">C</span>; the size of a proving key is about <span class="math">300</span> B per gate, and the size of a verification key is about <span class="math">1</span> B per byte of input to <span class="math">C</span>. Running the prover takes <span class="math">11</span> ms to <span class="math">14</span> ms per gate. For an <span class="math">n</span>-byte input, proof verification time is <span class="math">c_{1}n+c_{0}</span>, where <span class="math">c_{0}</span> is a few milliseconds and <span class="math">c_{1}</span> is a few tenths of microseconds.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 5.1. Another factor affecting the efficiency of <span class="math">G</span> and <span class="math">P</span> is the number of non-zero polynomials in the QAP instance obtained from the circuit <span class="math">C</span> (see Section 4.4). In Figure 8 we reported worst-case numbers in this respect: we only used circuits whose QAP has no non-zero polynomials. In general, QAP with more zero polynomials make the key generator and prover faster; in particular, the circuits output by our circuit generator induce QAP instances with many zero polynomials, so that the numbers reported in Section 5.3 are somewhat better than what one would expect by merely multiplying the per-gate costs of Figure 8 with the number of gates in the circuit output by the circuit generator.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-44" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5.3 Performance of the combined system</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As discussed, our circuit generator (Section 3) and zk-SNARK for circuits (Section 4) can be used independently, or combined to obtain a zk-SNARK for vnTinyRAM. For completeness, in Appendix D.2 we spell out how these two components can be combined. Here we report measured performance of this combined system, at the 128-bit security level, and for a word size <span class="math">W=32</span> and number of registers <span class="math">K=16</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Methodology. A zk-SNARK for vnTinyRAM is a triple of algorithms <span class="math">(\\mathsf{KeyGen},\\mathsf{Prove},\\mathsf{Verify})</span>. Given bounds <span class="math">\\ell,n,T</span> (for program size, input size, and time), the efficiency of <span class="math">\\mathsf{KeyGen}</span> and <span class="math">\\mathsf{Prove}</span> depends on <span class="math">\\ell,n,T</span>, while that of <span class="math">\\mathsf{Verify}</span> essentially depends only on <span class="math">\\ell,n</span>. Thus, we benchmark the system as follows.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We evaluate <span class="math">\\mathsf{KeyGen}</span> and <span class="math">\\mathsf{Prove}</span> for various choices of <span class="math">\\ell</span> and <span class="math">T</span>, while keeping <span class="math">n=100</span>. (Varying <span class="math">\\ell</span> or <span class="math">n</span> affects efficiency in similar ways, so we fix <span class="math">n</span> and vary <span class="math">\\ell</span>.) Instead, since the efficiency of <span class="math">\\mathsf{Verify}</span> does not depend on <span class="math">T</span>, we evaluate <span class="math">\\mathsf{Verify}</span>, for various choices of <span class="math">\\ell</span> and <span class="math">n</span>, on random <span class="math">\\ell</span>-instruction programs and <span class="math">n</span>-word inputs. In Figure 9, we report the following measurements: <span class="math">\\mathsf{KeyGen}</span>’s running time, the sizes of the keys <span class="math">\\mathsf{pk}</span> and <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}</span>, <span class="math">\\mathsf{Prove}</span>’s runtime, the (constant) proof size, and <span class="math">\\mathsf{Verify}</span>’s running time. For quantities growing with <span class="math">T</span>, we divide by <span class="math">T</span> and report the per-cycle cost.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 8: Performance of our zk-SNARK for arithmetic circuit satisfiability: per-gate costs of the key generator and prover for various circuit sizes; and per-byte costs of the verifier for various input sizes. ( <span class="math">N = 10</span>  and std  <span class="math">&amp;lt; 1\\%</span> )</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For completeness, Figure 13 in Appendix C reports the unnormalized measurements and additional information, such as times for various subcomputations (e.g., subtimes for the circuit generator and zk-SNARK).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Discussion. The measurements demonstrate that, on a desktop computer, our zk-SNARK for vnTinyRAM scales up to computations of 32,000 machine cycles, for programs with up to 10,000 instructions. Key generation takes about  <span class="math">200\\mathrm{ms}</span>  per cycle; the size of a proving key is  <span class="math">500\\mathrm{KB}</span>  to  <span class="math">650\\mathrm{KB}</span>  per cycle, and the size of a verification key is a few kilobytes in total. Running the prover takes  <span class="math">100\\mathrm{ms}</span>  to  <span class="math">200\\mathrm{ms}</span>  per cycle. Verification times remain a few milliseconds, even for inputs and programs of several kilobytes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Program-specific vk. The time complexity of Verify is  <span class="math">O(\\ell + n)</span> , so verification time grows with program size. This is inevitable, because Verify must read a program  <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span>  (of at most  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  instructions) and input  <span class="math">\\mathbf{x}</span>  (of at most  <span class="math">n</span>  words) in order to check, via the given proof  <span class="math">\\pi</span> , if  <span class="math">(\\mathbb{P}, \\mathbf{x}) \\in \\mathcal{L}_{\\ell, n, T}</span>  (cf. Definition 2.7). However, this is inconvenient, e.g., when one has to verify many proofs relative to different inputs to the same program  <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In our zk-SNARK it is possible to amortize this cost as follows. Given  <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> , one can derive, in time  <span class="math">O(\\ell)</span> , a program-specific verification key  <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}_{\\mathbb{P}}</span> , which can be used to verify proofs relative to any input to  <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> . Subsequently, the time complexity of Verify for any input  <span class="math">\\mathbf{x}</span>  (to  <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> ) is only  <span class="math">O(n)</span> , independent of  <span class="math">\\ell</span> . Essentially, one can pre-compute the program-specific part of  <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}_{\\vec{x}}</span>  (see Step 1 in Figure 10c), so that, later, one only needs to compute the input-dependent part of  <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}_{\\vec{x}}</span>  and combine it with  <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}_{\\mathbb{P}}</span> . (Conversely, it is also possible to derive an input-specific verification key, for verifying proofs relative to the same input to different programs.)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 13 in Appendix C also reports the subtime to compute  <span class="math">\\mathsf{vk}_{\\mathbb{P}}</span> , which represents the time saved when</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Universality is the main innovative feature of our circuit generator. No previous circuit generator achieves universality. (See Figure 1 and Section 3.)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Putting universality aside and focusing on efficiency instead, a comparison with previous circuit generators is a multi-faceted problem. On one hand, due to a shared core of techniques, a comparison with [BCGTV13a]'s circuit generator is straightforward, and shows significant improvements in circuit size, especially as program size grows. See Section 1.4.1 and Figure 2 (the figure's numbers are for  <span class="math">W</span> ,  <span class="math">K = 16</span> ).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Instead, a comparison with other circuit generators  <span class="math">\\left[\\mathrm{SVPB}^{+}12, \\mathrm{SBVB}^{+}13, \\mathrm{PGHR}13, \\mathrm{BFRS}^{+}13\\right]</span>  is complex. First, they support a smaller class of programs (see Figure 1), so a programmer must "write around" the limited functionality, somehow. And second, their efficiency is not easily specified: due to the use of program-analysis techniques (see Section 3.1) the output circuit is ad hoc for the given program, and the only way to know its size is to actually run the circuit generator.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Compared to  <span class="math">\\left[\\mathrm{SVPB}^{+}12, \\mathrm{SBVB}^{+}13, \\mathrm{PGHR}13, \\mathrm{BFRS}^{+}13\\right]</span> , our circuit generator performs better for programs that are rich in memory accesses and control flow, and worse for programs that are more "circuit like".</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Comparison with  <span class="math">\\left[\\mathrm{SVPB}^{+}12, \\mathrm{SBVB}^{+}13, \\mathrm{PGHR}13\\right]</span> . The circuit generators in  <span class="math">\\left[\\mathrm{SVPB}^{+}12, \\mathrm{SBVB}^{+}13, \\mathrm{PGHR}13\\right]</span>  restrict loop iteration bounds and memory accesses to be known at compile time; if a program does not respect these restrictions, it must be first somehow mapped to another one that does. For simplicity, we take  <span class="math">\\left[\\mathrm{PGHR}13\\right]</span> 's circuit generator (the latest one) as representative and, to illustrate the differences between  <span class="math">\\left[\\mathrm{PGHR}13\\right]</span> 's and our circuit generator, we consider two "extremes".</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">On one extreme, we wrote a simple C program multiplying two  <span class="math">10 \\times 10</span>  matrices of 16-bit integers. The circuit generator in [PGHR13] produces a circuit with 1100 gates; instead, our circuit generator (when given</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">the corresponding vnTinyRAM assembly) produces a much larger circuit: one with <span class="math">\\approx 10^{7}</span> gates.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">On the other extreme, we consider a program making many random accesses to memory: pointer-chasing. Given a permutation <span class="math">\\pi</span> of <span class="math">[N]</span>, start position <span class="math">i\\in[N]</span>, and an integer <span class="math">k</span>, the program outputs <span class="math">\\pi^{k}(i)</span>, the element obtained by starting from <span class="math">i</span> and following “pointers” for <span class="math">k</span> times. Since no information about <span class="math">\\pi</span> is known at compile time, the only way of obtaining <span class="math">\\pi(j)</span>, the pointer to follow, in <em>[x13]</em> is via a <em>linear scan</em>. On a simple C program that does one linear scan of <span class="math">\\pi</span> to obtain each new pointer, <em>[x13]</em>’s circuit generator outputs a circuit with <span class="math">2Nk+1</span> gates (each of the <span class="math">k</span> array accesses costs <span class="math">2N</span> gates).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In vnTinyRAM, the corresponding program <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> consists of <span class="math">9</span> instructions, and the input <span class="math">\\mathtt{x}</span> to it is <span class="math">N+3</span> words. Booting vnTinyRAM with <span class="math">\\mathbb{P}</span> and <span class="math">\\mathtt{x}</span> requires <span class="math">9+N+3</span> “boot stores” (see Section 3.2), and takes <span class="math">5+4k</span> cycles to execute (independent of <span class="math">N</span>). Say that we fix <span class="math">k=10</span>; then, in our circuit generator (with <span class="math">W=32</span> and <span class="math">K=16</span>), each cycle costs about <span class="math">2000</span> gates, and can perform a random access to memory. Thus, pointer chasing in our case is cheaper than in <em>[x13]</em> already for <span class="math">N&gt;5000</span>, and the multiplicative saving, which is about <span class="math">\\frac{20N}{2000\\cdot(5+40)}=\\frac{N}{4500}</span>, grows unbounded as <span class="math">N</span> increases.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Comparison with <em>[BFRS^{+}13]</em>. The circuit generator of <em>[BFRS^{+}13]</em> is also based on program analysis, but provides an additional feature that allows data-dependent memory accesses: a program may access memory by guessing the value and verifying its validity via a subcircuit that checks Merkle-tree authentication paths. In <em>[BFRS^{+}13]</em>, memory consists of <span class="math">2^{30}</span> cells, and each access costs many gates: <span class="math">140</span>K for a load, and <span class="math">280</span>K for a store. In comparison, in our circuit generator for vnTinyRAM (with word size <span class="math">W=32</span> so that memory has <span class="math">2^{32}</span> cells), each memory store/load costs less than <span class="math">1000</span> gates out of about <span class="math">2000</span> per cycle (see Section 5.1). Besides the aforementioned feature, <em>[BFRS^{+}13]</em> rely on program analysis, and (as in <em>[SVPB^{+}12, SBVB^{+}13, x13]</em>) only support bounded control flow. Thus, <em>[BFRS^{+}13]</em> performs better than our circuit generator for programs with bounded control flow and few data-dependent accesses to memory.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is an intriguing open question whether techniques underlying our circuit generator can be combined with program analysis so to yield circuit generators achieving good efficiency both for restricted and rich programs, and avoid the sharp functionality vs. efficiency tradeoffs that exist among current circuit generators.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-47" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">5.4.2 Comparison with prior zk-SNARKs</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Addressing the other component of our system, the zk-SNARK for circuits: Figure 3 compares our implementation with prior ones, on a <span class="math">1</span>-million-gate circuit with a 1000-byte input. As shown, we mildly improve the key generation time and, more importantly, significantly improve the “online” costs of proving and verification.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-48" class="text-2xl font-bold">6 Conclusion</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We have presented two main contributions: (i) a circuit generator for a von Neumann RISC architecture that is <em>universal</em> and scales <em>additively</em> with program size; and (ii) a high-performance zk-SNARK for arithmetic circuit satisfiability. These two components can be used independently to the benefit of other systems, or combined into a zk-SNARK that can prove/verify correctness of computations on this architecture.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The benefits of universality. Universality attains the conceptual advance of <em>once-and-for-all key generation</em>, allowing verifying all programs up to a given size. This removes major issues in prior systems: expensive per-program key generation and the thorny issue of conducting it anew in a trusted way for every program.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The price of universality. We have demonstrated that our zk-SNARK scales, on a desktop computer, up to computations of <span class="math">32{,}000</span> cycles, for programs with up to <span class="math">10{,}000</span> instructions, relative to a simple universal computer (vnTinyRAM). Yet, the price of universality is still very high. Going forward, and aiming for widespread use in security applications, more work is required to slash costs of key generation and proving so to scale up to larger computations: e.g., billion-gate circuits, or millions of vnTinyRAM cycles, and beyond.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">An interesting open problem is whether the “program analysis” techniques underlying most prior circuit generators <em>[SVPB^{+}12, SBVB^{+}13, PGHR13, BFRS^{+}13]</em>, typically more efficient for restricted classes of programs, can be used to construct universal circuits (for those same classes of programs).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Beyond vnTinyRAM. Finally, going beyond the foundation of a von Neumann RISC architecture, more work lies ahead towards a richer architecture (e.g., efficient support for floating-point arithmetic and cryptographic acceleration), code libraries, and tighter compilers.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A Other prior work</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Prior work most relevant to us is about zk-SNARKs, and is discussed in Section 1.2. There are also numerous works studying variations or relaxations of the goal we consider; here, we summarize some of them.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Interactive proofs for low-depth circuits. Goldwasser et al. <em>[x14]</em> obtained an interactive proof for outsourcing computations of <em>low-depth circuits</em>. A set of works <em>[x10, x31, x32]</em> has optimized and implemented the protocol of <em>[x14]</em>. The protocol of <em>[x14]</em> can also be reduced to a two-message argument system <em>[x22, x23]</em>. Canetti et al. <em>[x13]</em> showed how to extend the techniques in <em>[x14]</em> to also handle non-uniform circuits.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Batching arguments. Ishai et al. <em>[x17]</em> constructed a <em>batching argument</em> for <span class="math">\\NP</span>, where, to simultaneously verify that <span class="math">N</span> circuits of size <span class="math">S</span> are satisfiable, the verifier runs in time <span class="math">\\max\\{S^{2},N\\}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A set of works <em>[x33, x34, SVPB^{+}12, SBVB^{+}13]</em> has improved, optimized, and implemented the batching argument of Ishai et al. <em>[x17]</em> for the purpose of outsourcing computation. In particular, by relying on quadratic arithmetic programs of <em>[x12]</em>, Setty et al. <em>[SBVB^{+}13]</em> have improved the running time of the verifier and prover to <span class="math">\\max\\{S,N\\}\\cdot\\operatorname{poly}(\\lambda)</span> and <span class="math">\\tilde{O}(S)\\cdot\\operatorname{poly}(\\lambda)</span> respectively.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Vu et al. <em>[x35]</em> provide a system that incorporates both the batching arguments of <em>[x33, x34, SVPB^{+}12, SBVB^{+}13]</em> as well as the interactive proofs of <em>[x10, x31, x32]</em>. The system decides which of the two approaches is more efficient to use for outsourcing a given computation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Braun et al. <em>[BFRS^{+}13]</em> apply batching techniques (as well as zk-SNARKs) to verify MapReduce computations, by relying on various verifiable data structures.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Arguments with competing provers. Canetti et al. <em>[x13]</em> use collision-resistant hashes to get a protocol for outsourcing deterministic computations in a model where a verifier interacts with two computationally-bounded provers at least one of which is honest <em>[x16]</em>. The protocol in <em>[x13]</em> works <em>directly</em> for random-access machines, and therefore does not require reducing random-access machines to any “lower-level” representation (such as circuits). Canetti et al. implement their protocol for deterministic x86 programs.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Previous circuit generators. Some prior work addresses the problem of translating high-level languages into low-level languages such as circuits. Most prior work only supports restricted classes of programs: <em>[SVPB^{+}12, SBVB^{+}13]</em> present a circuit generator based on Fairplay <em>[x27, x5]</em>, whose SFDL language does not support important primitives and has inefficient support for others; <em>[x29]</em> present a circuit generator for programs without data dependencies (pointers and array indices must be known at compile time, and so do loop iteration bounds).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Other works support more general functionality: <em>[x6]</em> rely on nondeterministic routing to support random-access machine computations <em>[x5]</em>; <em>[BFRS^{+}13]</em> rely on online memory checking <em>[x1, x6]</em> to support accessing untrusted storage from a circuit.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">See <em>[BFRS^{+}13, Section 2]</em> for a more detailed overview of some of the above techniques.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Other cryptographic tools. <em>Fully-homomorphic encryption</em> (FHE) <em>[x15]</em> and <em>probabilistically-checkable proofs</em> <em>[x1, x2]</em> are powerful tools that are often used in protocols for outsourcing computations (with integrity or confidentiality guarantees, or both) <em>[x20, x24, x1, x11, x12, x13]</em>. However, such constructions have so far not been explored in practice. Another powerful tool is <em>secure multi-party computation</em> <em>[x17, x4]</em>, but most work in this area does not consider the goal of succinctness.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-50" class="text-2xl font-bold">Appendix</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the purposes of completeness and to fix notation, in Figure 10 below we recall the zk-SNARK protocol of Parno et al. [PGHR13]. The zk-SNARK can be used to prove/verify satisfiability of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_r</span> -arithmetic circuits, where  <span class="math">r</span>  is the order of the two cyclic groups  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span> , forming the domain of the pairing  <span class="math">e: \\mathbb{G}_1 \\times \\mathbb{G}_2 \\to \\mathbb{G}_T</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We refer the reader to [PGHR13] for further details regarding the intuition for the protocol, as well as the cryptographic assumptions on which its proof of security relies. (Briefly, security relies on the q-power Diffie-Hellman, q-power knowledge-of-exponent, and q-strong Diffie-Hellman assumptions [Gro10b, BB04, Gen04] for q that depends polynomially on the arithmetic circuit's size.)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 10: The zk-SNARK protocol of Parno et al. [PGHR13]. (More precisely, the protocol above differs from [PGHR13] in two ways. First, it does not assume that  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1 = \\mathbb{G}_2</span> . Second, it has a verification key whose size grows as  <span class="math">n + o(n)</span> , rather than  <span class="math">3n + o(n)</span>  by leveraging the non-degeneracy property in Lemma 2.4. The current version remedies a problem found by Gabizon [Gab19] and reported as CVE-2019-7167 in Zcash:  <span class="math">\\mathsf{pk}_{\\mathsf{A}}^{\\prime}</span>  now starts at index  <span class="math">n + 1</span> , and  <span class="math">\\mathsf{pk}_{\\mathsf{A}}</span> ,  <span class="math">\\mathsf{pk}_{\\mathsf{A}}^{\\prime}</span>  have been redefined accordingly.)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">C Additional experimental data</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For completeness, we report additional experimental data, beyond that reported in Section 5.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Additional data for our circuit generator. In Section 5.1 we discuss the performance of our circuit generator for vnTinyRAM, and provided per-cycle gate counts in Figure 7. In Figure 11 we provide an extended version of Figure 7.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Additional data for our zk-SNARK for circuits. In Section 5.2 we discuss how we evaluated <span class="math">(G,P,V)</span>, which is our zk-SNARK for arithmetic circuit satisfiability. In Figure 12 we report the unnormalized data from which Figure 8 is derived: we report the costs of the key generator <span class="math">G</span> and prover <span class="math">P</span> for various circuit sizes, and of the verifier <span class="math">V</span> for various input sizes. We also provide information on various subcomputations, split between the information-theoretic ones having to do with QAPs, and the cryptographic ones having to do with exponentiations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The reported key sizes assume that an element of <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_{1}</span> or <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_{2}</span> is <em>compressed</em> (i.e., a point <span class="math">(x_{0},y_{0})</span> lying on an elliptic curve <span class="math">y^{2}=x^{3}+Ax+B</span> is encoded as <span class="math">(x_{0},b)</span>, where <span class="math">b</span> is a bit distinguishing between the two square roots of <span class="math">x_{0}^{3}+Ax_{0}+B</span>); to use a key, one typically first <em>decompresses</em> each element (and this is a one-time operation after transmission).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the verifier, the reported running times assume that vk has been preprocessed (see Section 4.2), which is a one-time operation that can be amortized across any number of verifications.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Additional data for the combined system. In Section 5.3 we discuss how we evaluated <span class="math">(\\mathsf{KeyGen},\\mathsf{Prove},\\mathsf{Verify})</span>, which is our zk-SNARK for vnTinyRAM. In Figure 13 we report part of the unnormalized data from which Figure 9 is derived, and also provide the same data for word size <span class="math">W=16</span> as a comparison (since Figure 9 only reports <span class="math">W=32</span>). Concretely, we report the costs of <span class="math">\\mathsf{KeyGen}</span> for various choices of program size bound <span class="math">\\ell</span> and time bound <span class="math">T</span>, while keeping the input size bound <span class="math">n</span> fixed at <span class="math">100</span>; similarly for <span class="math">\\mathsf{Prove}</span>. As for <span class="math">\\mathsf{Verify}</span>, we report its running time for various choices of program size bound <span class="math">\\ell</span> and input size bound <span class="math">n</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We also provide information on various subcomputations, specifically on how the running times are divided between the circuit generator and the zk-SNARK (the two components from which <span class="math">(\\mathsf{KeyGen},\\mathsf{Prove},\\mathsf{Verify})</span> is constructed). Namely, for <span class="math">\\mathsf{KeyGen}</span> we report the subtime for running the circuit generator circ and the remaining time, which is spent in the zk-SNARK key generator <span class="math">G</span>. And for <span class="math">\\mathsf{Prove}</span> we report the subtime for running the witness map wit and the remaining time, which is spent in the zk-SNARK prover <span class="math">P</span>. For <span class="math">\\mathsf{Verify}</span>, we report the subtime to derive the program-specific verification key vk_{P} (see Section 5.3); this represents the time that is saved if one wishes to verify multiple statements <span class="math">(\\mathbb{P},\\mathbb{x})</span> for different inputs <span class="math">\\mathbb{x}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For completeness, we explain how a circuit generator for vnTinyRAM (see Section 3) can be combined with a zk-SNARK for arithmetic circuit satisfiability to obtain a zk-SNARK for vnTinyRAM. We first informally define zk-SNARKs for vnTinyRAM (Appendix D.1) and then we give the construction (Appendix D.2).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A zk-SNARK for vnTinyRAM is a cryptographic primitive that gives short and easy-to-verify non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge for the correct execution of programs on the machine vnTinyRAM.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 14: A zk-SNARK for vnTinyRAM is obtained by combining the circuit generator and the zk-SNARK for circuit satisfiability.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">(G, P, V)</span>  be a zk-SNARK for  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_r</span> -arithmetic circuit satisfiability, and let (circ, wit) be a circuit generator for vnTinyRAM over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_r</span> . (The prime  <span class="math">r</span>  is typically determined by the order of the two cyclic groups  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span>  that form the domain of the pairing  <span class="math">e: \\mathbb{G}_1 \\times \\mathbb{G}_2 \\to \\mathbb{G}_T</span>  used to instantiate  <span class="math">(G, P, V)</span> .) In Figure 14 below, we give the construction of the three algorithms (KeyGen, Prove, Verify) of a zk-SNARK for vnTinyRAM.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">E Case study: memcpy with just-in-time compilation</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The function memcpy is a standard C function that works as follows: given as input two array pointers and a length, memcpy copies the contents of one array to the other. Of course, with no data dependencies, copying data in a circuit is trivial: you just connect the appropriate wires. However, when the array addresses and their lengths are unknown, and memcpy is invoked as a subroutine in a larger program, the trivial solution does not work, and an efficient implementation is needed.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A naive implementation of memcpy iterates, via a loop, over each array position <span class="math">i</span> and copies the <span class="math">i</span>-th value from one array to the other. In vnTinyRAM each such loop iteration costs <span class="math">6</span> instructions; <span class="math">2</span> of these are to increase the iteration counter and jump back to the start of the loop. Thus, for <span class="math">m</span>-long arrays, copying takes <span class="math">6m</span> instructions (discounting loop initialization). A cost of <span class="math">6m</span> also holds for TinyRAM of <em>[x1]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">But, in vnTinyRAM, one can do better: loop unrolling can be used to avoid paying for the <span class="math">2</span> “control” instructions. Asymptotically, the optimal number of unrollings depends on the array length: it is <span class="math">\\Theta(\\sqrt{m})</span>. Thus, optimal unrolling requires dynamic code generation on a von Neumann architecture. We wrote a <span class="math">54</span>-instruction vnTinyRAM program for memcpy that uses dynamic loop unrolling to achieve an efficiency of <span class="math">\\approx 4m+11.5\\sqrt{m}</span> cycles for <span class="math">m</span>-long arrays. For <span class="math">m\\geq 600</span>, we get <span class="math">1.25\\times</span> speed-up over the naive implementation, and <span class="math">1.4\\times</span> speed-up for <span class="math">m\\geq 3000</span>.</p>

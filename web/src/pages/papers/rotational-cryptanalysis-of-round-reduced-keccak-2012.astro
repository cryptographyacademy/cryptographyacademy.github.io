    <h2 id="sec-4" class="text-2xl font-bold">1 Introduction</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In 2007, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced a public contest aiming at the selection of a new standard for a cryptographic hash function. The main motivation behind starting the contest has been the security flaws identified in the SHA-1 standard in 2005. Similarities between SHA-1 and the most recent standard SHA-2 were worrisome and NIST decided that a new, stronger hash function would be needed. Overall, 51 functions were submitted to the first round of the contest. In July 2009 out of the submitted functions, 14 were selected to the second round. At the end of 2010, the five finalists were announced and eventually in October 2012 the winner has been selected. The new SHA-3 standard will be Keccak hash function <em>[5]</em>. In this paper we analyze Keccak using a technique called rotational cryptanalysis.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Rotational analysis is a relatively new type of attack. The technique was mentioned and applied in <em>[2, 14, 16]</em>, and formally introduced in <em>[12]</em>. Unlike the differential analysis, where for a pair <span class="math">(x,y)</span> the attacker follows the propagation of the difference <span class="math">x\\oplus y</span> through the cryptographic system, in the rotational analysis, the adversary investigates the propagation of the rotational relations through the cryptographic transformations. Khovratovich and Nikolić in <em>[12]</em> analyze the primitives composed of only three operations: addition, rotation, xor (ARX). For these primitives, they prove that the probability that a rotational pair of inputs will produce a rotational pair on the output depends on the number of additions only. In <em>[17]</em> a rotational distinguisher was designed for the keyed permutation of the Shabal hash function. Rotational cryptanalysis was combined with the rebound attack and applied to the compression function of the SHA-3 candidate Skein and its underlying cipher Threefish <em>[13]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The known cryptanalytic results on Keccak can be divided into two types. The first type is showing a non-random behaviour, weakness in the Keccak’s internal permutation, such as our rotational distinguishers. The second type is attacking the core security properties of the whole function (a preimage attack and a collision attack). The distinguisher of Keccak’s permutation with the highest number of rounds is the zero-sum distinguisher proposed in <em>[1]</em> and later improved in <em>[6, 9]</em>. However, the complexity of these distinguishers is very high. For example, the zero-sum distinguisher for all 24 rounds has the complexity of <span class="math">2^{1579}</span>. A differential analysis of Keccak’s internal permutation, given in <em>[10]</em>, leads to distinguishers up to 8 rounds with complexity of <span class="math">2^{491.47}</span> and for 5 rounds with complexity of <span class="math">2^{8}</span>. Among the attacks on the Keccak hash function, the most rounds were reached by Bernstein in his 8-round preimage attack <em>[3]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, the attack is much slower than parallel exhaustive search and it is inherently memory-intensive. Also with the aid of differential analysis, Naya-Plasencia et al. mounted the preimage and collision attacks on 2-round KECCAK [15]. In [11] the same result (2-round preimage and 2-round collision attacks) were obtained through the SAT-based attacks. The most successful collision attack was given in [8] where 4-round collisions were presented.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper we focus our analysis on the KECCAK variants proposed as SHA-3 candidates. First we analyze the permutation KECCAK- <span class="math">f[1600]</span> . We mount the 4-round rotational distinguisher and then enhance it with a correlation analysis which improves the result to 5 rounds. We implement the distinguishers and verify the experimental results. Unlike the other rotational analysis we treat rotational relations between bits independently and we operate on probabilities of rotational relations. Our rotational cryptanalysis not only serves as a mean to show a non-random behaviour in the cryptographic primitive, but also for the first time the technique is used for mounting the preimage attack. A family of 4-round distinguishers is the base for our 4-round preimage attack with the complexity 64 times lower than exhaustive search. This is also the first 4-round preimage attack with a negligible amount of memory needed for the attack.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section we provide a description of KECCAK to the extent necessary for understanding the attack described in the paper. For a complete specification, we refer the interested reader to the original specification [5].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">KECCAK uses the sponge construction and hence is a member of the sponge function family [4]. Figure 1 shows the construction. It can be used as a hash function but also can be applied for generating infinite bit stream, making it suitable as a stream cipher or a pseudorandom bit generator. In this paper we focus on the sponge construction for cryptographic hashing. KECCAK has two main parameters  <span class="math">r</span>  and  <span class="math">c</span> , which are called bitrate and capacity, respectively. The sum of those two makes the state size, which KECCAK operates on. For the SHA-3 proposal, the state size is 1600 bits. Different values for bitrate and capacity give the trade-off between speed and security. The higher bitrate gives the faster function that is less secure. KECCAK follows the sponge two-phase processing.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The initial 1600-bit state is filled with 0's. In the first phase (also called the absorbing phase), interleaved with applications of the permutation  <span class="math">f</span>  (called KECCAK-  <span class="math">f</span>  in the specification). The</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">!<a href="img-0.jpeg">img-0.jpeg</a> Fig.1. Sponge Construction [4]</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">absorbing phase is finished when all message blocks have been processed. In the second phase (also called the squeezing phase), the first  <span class="math">r</span>  bits of the state are returned as part of the output bits, interleaved with applications of the function  <span class="math">f</span> . The squeezing phase is finished after the desired length of output digest has been produced.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the variants proposed as SHA-3 candidates, the value of the parameter  <span class="math">c</span>  is equal to a hash length multiplied by 2. For example, the SHA-3 candidate with 512-bit hash length is KECCAK with  <span class="math">c = 1024</span>  and  <span class="math">r = 576</span>  ( <span class="math">r + c = 1600</span> ). In this paper we denote variants proposed as SHA-3 candidates by KECCAK-512, KECCAK-384, KECCAK-256, and KECCAK-224. (The number is a hash length for a given variant.)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">KECCAK can also operate on smaller states but through the whole paper we always refer to the default variant with 1600-bit state. The state can be visualised as an array of  <span class="math">5 \\times 5</span>  lanes, each lane is 64-bit long. The state size determines the number of rounds in KECCAK- <span class="math">f</span>  function. For the default 1600-bit state there are 24 rounds. All rounds are the same except for constants which are different for each round.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Below there is a pseudo-code of a single round. In the latter part of the paper, we often refer to the algorithm steps (denoted by Greek letters) described in the following pseudo-code.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">All the operations on the indices shown in the pseudo-code are done modulo 5. A denotes the complete permutation state array and A[x,y] denotes a particular lane in that state. B[x,y], C[x], D[x] are 64-bit intermediate variables. The constants r[x,y] are the rotation offsets, while RC are the round constants. rot(W,m) is the usual bitwise rotation operation, moving bit at position <span class="math">i</span> into position <span class="math">i+m</span> in lane W (<span class="math">i+m</span> are done modulo 64 – note that 64 is the lane size for the default variant of Keccak). <span class="math">\\theta</span> is the linear operation intends to provide diffusion for the state. <span class="math">\\rho</span> is a permutation between bits in the lanes and <span class="math">\\pi</span> is a permutation between the whole lanes. The only non-linear operation is <span class="math">\\chi</span> which can be treated as a layer of 5-bit Sboxes. Finally, <span class="math">\\iota</span> xores the round constant with the first lane. The constants play a vital role in our analysis and it is worth mentioning that they have the very low Hamming weight. The constants for the first 5 rounds are: 0000000000000001, 0000000000008082, 800000000000808a, 8000000080008000, 000000000000808b (given respectively in hexadecimal using the little-endian format).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In our work we often need to refer to a particular bit of the state and we do that by <span class="math">A_{(x,y,z)}</span>. The coordinates <span class="math">x,y</span> range from 0 to 4 specifying the lane in the state and the coordinate <span class="math">z</span> ranges from 0 to 63 specifying the bit number in the given lane. With this notation we can refer to a state by <span class="math">A</span>, to a lane by <span class="math">A_{(3,2)}</span>, to a value of a single bit by <span class="math">A_{(1,4,6)}</span>, or to a position of a single bit by <span class="math">(3,1,60)</span>.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-6" class="text-2xl font-bold">3 Rotational distinguishers for the Keccak-<span class="math">f</span>[1600] permutation</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In our analysis we follow the relation between two states <span class="math">(A,A^{\\leftarrow})</span> which change through subsequent steps of Keccak-<span class="math">f</span>[1600] permutation. In particular we are interested in evolution of a rotational pair of states. Let us define the rotational pair in the context of the Keccak-<span class="math">f</span>[1600] permutation.</p>

    <h6 id="sec-7" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Definition 1</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A pair of two 1600-bit states (<span class="math">A</span>, <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}</span>) is called a rotational pair when each lane in the state <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}</span> is created by bitwise rotation operation of the corresponding lane in the state <span class="math">A</span>. The operation moves the bit from the position <span class="math">(x,y,z)</span> to the position <span class="math">(x,y,z+n)</span>, where <span class="math">z+n</span> is done modulo 64. The coordinates <span class="math">x,y</span> range from 0 to 4 specifying the lane in the state and the coordinate <span class="math">z</span> ranges from 0 to 63 specifying the bit number in the given lane. <span class="math">n</span> is called a rotational number and is the same for every lane. Thus in the rotational pair <span class="math">\\forall(x,y,z):A_{(x,y,z)}=A_{(x,y,z+n)}^{\\leftarrow}</span>.</p>

    <h6 id="sec-8" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Remark 1</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Following Definition 1, there are up to 64 possible rotational pairs including a pair, where <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}</span> are the same (having <span class="math">n=0</span>). We will use this fact in the preimage attack described later in the paper.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In some parts of this work we are interested in the probability that a given pair is a rotational one or a given pair of corresponding bits preserve the rotational relation. Two following definitions help to formally define this probability.</p>

    <h6 id="sec-9" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Definition 2</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Set <span class="math">S_{n}</span> is a set of <span class="math">2^{1600}</span> pairs of states which are created by an operation (some number of steps of Keccak-<span class="math">f</span>[1600] or their inverse) applied to all possible rotational pairs. (All possible means <span class="math">2^{1600}</span> possible rotational pairs for a chosen rotational number <span class="math">n</span>.)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^n</span>  can be expressed as  <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^n = 1/2 + \\epsilon_{(x,y,z)}^n</span> .

    <p class="text-gray-300">When mounting distinguishers we refer to a random permutation which now we define formally.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Given a permutation of  <span class="math">n</span> -bit sequences, i.e.  <span class="math">p: \\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}^n</span> . The collection of all permutations over  <span class="math">n</span>  bit sequences is denoted by  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_n</span> . The cardinality of the set  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_n</span>  is  <span class="math">n!</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Definition 4.

A permutation is called random if it is chosen according to the (uniform) distribution  <span class="math">\\mathcal{D}_n</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For a random permutation we assume that  <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^n</span>  follows the binomial distribution  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}(t,s)</span>  where  <span class="math">t</span>  is a number of trials and  <span class="math">s</span>  is a probability of success and is equal to 0.5. The mean for the binomial distribution equals  <span class="math">s\\cdot t</span>  and the standard deviation  <span class="math">\\sigma = \\sqrt{(1 - s)s\\cdot t}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To distinguish KECCAK-  <span class="math">f[1600]</span>  permutation from a random permutation we check whether the experimental results (for a chosen  <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}</span> ) follow the binomial distribution  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}(t,0.5)</span> . We choose a typical  <span class="math">95\\%</span>  confidence interval and hence the mean from the experimental sample should be within the range  <span class="math">0.5t \\pm 2\\sigma</span> . If the mean is beyond that range we conclude that experimental results do not follow the binomial distribution  <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}(t,0.5)</span>  and hence KECCAK-  <span class="math">f[1600]</span>  can be distinguished from a random permutation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To calculate how the probabilities change through the successive steps of the algorithm, let us first analyze two basic bitwise operations used in KECCAK.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the following Lemmas it is assumed that each  <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}</span>  is independent. Also we assume that if corresponding bits from  <span class="math">(A, A^{\\leftarrow})</span>  are equal, both combinations ('00' or '11') have the same probability to be the actual values.

    <p class="text-gray-300">There is also the bitwise NOT operation in the algorithm but it does not affect the probabilities. NOT flips the values of the corresponding bits <span class="math">A_{(x,y,z)}</span> and <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}_{(x,y,z+n)}</span> but their relation (or precisely speaking the probability of relation <span class="math">p^{n}_{(x,y,z)}</span>) remains unchanged. Also the bitwise rotation operation (denoted in the pseudo-code as rot(W,n)) does not change the values of probabilities. It rotates the bits in the lane so their positions (coordinates <span class="math">z</span> in <span class="math">p^{n}_{(x,y,z)}</span>) change while their probabilities <span class="math">p^{n}_{(x,y,z)}</span> are not changed.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Having explained how the basic bitwise operations change the rotation probabilities, the analysis of the Keccak-<span class="math">f</span>[1600] steps remains mostly straightforward. In the transformation <span class="math">\\theta</span>, there is the XOR operation only, applied a number of times. Due to the linearity of the XOR operation, the repeated application of Lemma 2 will give the correct results of calculated probabilities. For the permutations <span class="math">\\rho</span> and <span class="math">\\pi</span>, nothing needs to be calculated as only the positions of bits change. In the transformation <span class="math">\\chi</span>, the two Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 are applied. The last step is the transformation <span class="math">\\iota</span>, where the lane (0,0) is xored with a constant. Xoring with ‘0’ does not change anything. However, if there is ‘1’ at position <span class="math">m</span> in the constant and a rotational number <span class="math">n&gt;0</span>, then xoring with a constant change the probabilities as follows</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let us consider two 8-bit lanes <span class="math">A_{(0,0)}</span> and <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}_{(0,0)}</span> with the rotational number <span class="math">n=3</span>. The lanes have the following binary values: <span class="math">A_{(0,0)}=00000010</span> and <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}_{(0,0)}=00010000</span>. Because <span class="math">\\forall z</span>: <span class="math">A_{(0,0,z)}=A^{\\leftarrow}_{(0,0,z+3)}</span>, then <span class="math">\\forall z</span>: <span class="math">p^{3}_{(x,y,z)}=0</span> (according to Definition 3). Now if both lanes are xored with 8-bit constant <span class="math">C=00000001</span>, new values of lanes are <span class="math">A_{(0,0)}=00000011</span> and <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}_{(0,0)}=00010001</span>. Rotational relation has been spoilt at two positions (0 and 5), therefore the probabilities <span class="math">p^{3}_{(0,0,0)}</span> and <span class="math">p^{3}_{(0,0,5)}</span> are now equal to 1. In Keccak-<span class="math">f</span>[1600] the constants are 64-bit long but the reasoning shown above is still valid.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-12" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.1 4-round distinguishers</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We build a 4-round rotational distinguisher and show that after 4 rounds, there are some coordinates <span class="math">(x,y,z)</span> and the rotational number <span class="math">n</span> for which <span class="math">p^{n}_{(x,y,z)}</span> does not follow the binomial distribution <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}(t,0.5)</span>. Figure 3 illustrates an evolution of rotation probabilities. A single square represents a value (or a range of values) of the probability <span class="math">p^{n}_{(x,y,z)}</span>. Usually in this paper, we refer to a lane by its two coordinates <span class="math">(x,y)</span>. However here for the sake of diagram readability instead of 5x5 matrix of lanes there are 25 rows, each representing a single lane. For example, a value of <span class="math">p^{n}_{(0,1,0)}</span> is represented by the leftmost square in the sixth row and <span class="math">p^{n}_{(4,4,63)}</span> is represented by the rightmost square in the last (25th) row.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the beginning, all corresponding bits from a rotational pair are equal so <span class="math">\\forall(x,y,z)\\;p^{n}_{(x,y,z)}=0</span>. After the first application of <span class="math">\\iota</span>, some probabilities <span class="math">p^{n}_{(x,y,z)}</span> change and in the subsequent steps these changes propagate and influence other bits. For most rotational numbers <span class="math">n</span>, there are some probabilities <span class="math">p^{n}_{(x,y,z)}</span> deviating from 0.5 until the end of the 4th round. According to our calculations, at the end of 4th round the probability <span class="math">p^{54}_{(4,4,14)}=0.5625</span>. To verify the distinguisher</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">we chose randomly 10000 rotational pairs and ran them on the 4-round Keccak-<span class="math">f</span>[1600]. The mean from that sample was equal to 5682 (for 5682 rotational pairs bits had different values). For a random permutation which follows the binomial distribution <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}(10000,0.5)</span>, the mean equals 5000 and the standard deviation equals 50. Thus the mean from the experiment on the 4-round Keccak-<span class="math">f</span>[1600] should be within the range <span class="math">5000\\pm 2\\cdot 50</span> and clearly 5682 is beyond that range. Hence we conclude we have a distinguisher for the 4-round Keccak-<span class="math">f</span>[1600] permutation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To extend the distinguisher to 5 rounds, we show that correlation between some corresponding bits from <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}</span> deviates from what is expected from random permutation. Let us first give an observation which helps to mount the 5-round distinguisher.</p>

    <h6 id="sec-14" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Observation 1</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Consider two bits (<span class="math">A_{(x,y,z)}</span>, <span class="math">A_{(x,y^{\\prime},z)}</span>) from state <span class="math">A</span> which are in the same column and let us assume that we know the probability that <span class="math">A_{(x,y,z)}\\neq A_{(x,y^{\\prime},z)}</span>). Our point is that <span class="math">\\theta</span> does not change this probability. It is because <span class="math">\\theta</span> treats each bit within a column in the same way: either it flips all 5 of them or it leaves them unchanged.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We can use this observation in our rotational analysis. The difference is that now we look at relations in one pair (<span class="math">A_{(x,y,z)}</span>, <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}_{(x,y,z+n)}</span>) and the second pair (<span class="math">A_{(x,y^{\\prime},z)}</span>, <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}_{(x,y^{\\prime},z+n)}</span>). Each of these two pairs has the relation between its bits (that is bits have either the same or opposite values). We are interested whether the relations are the same in both pairs, specifically the probability that relations are the same in both pairs. For a random permutation this probability has the binomial distribution <span class="math">\\mathcal{B}(t,0.5)</span>. If we can show that for the 5-round Keccak-<span class="math">f</span>[1600] experimental results do not follow this distribution, then we have a distinguisher.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">First we determine a rotational number <span class="math">n</span> for which <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}</span> and <span class="math">p_{(x,y^{\\prime},z)}^{n}</span> have the highest deviation from 0.5 at the end of the 4th round. It turns out that for <span class="math">n=63</span>, <span class="math">p_{(2,1,37)}^{63}</span> and <span class="math">p_{(2,2,37)}^{63}</span> is the best pair (p<span class="math">{}_{(2,1,37)}^{63}=0.5625</span> and <span class="math">p_{(2,2,37)}^{63}=0.49219</span>). Now let <span class="math">P_{c}</span> denotes a probability that in the first pair (<span class="math">A_{(x,y,z)}</span>, <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}_{(x,y,z+n)}</span>) and in the second pair (<span class="math">A_{(x,y^{\\prime},z)}</span>, <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}_{(x,y^{\\prime},z+n)}</span>) is the same relation. That is the probability:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">P_{c}=p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}\\cdot p_{(x,y^{\\prime},z)}^{n}+(1-p_{(x,y,z)}^{n})(1-p_{(x,y^{\\prime},z)}^{n})</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We can calculate <span class="math">P_{c}</span> for the chosen pair <span class="math">p_{(2,1,37)}^{63}</span> and <span class="math">p_{(2,2,37)}^{63}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">P_{c}=0.5625\\cdot 0.49219+(1-0.5625)(1-0.49219)=0.49902375</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This is the <span class="math">P_{c}</span> value at the beginning of the 5th round. Then we have to examine how the steps in the algorithm change this probability. As explained in Observation 1, <span class="math">\\theta</span> does not change this value. Subsequent algorithm steps <span class="math">\\rho</span> and <span class="math">\\pi</span> also do not change <span class="math">P_{c}</span> value, they only change a position of <span class="math">P_{c}</span> which now refers to different pairs of bits (<span class="math">A_{(1,2,43)}</span>, <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}_{(1,2,44)}</span>) and (<span class="math">A_{(2,0,16)}</span>, <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}_{(2,0,17)}</span>). After that there is <span class="math">\\chi</span> which preserves the relation between the first pair and the second with a probability equals 0.53125. The reason that this value deviates from 0.5 is that <span class="math">\\chi</span> is a non-linear operation and precisely the bitwise AND operation which introduces the bias. All the details on how this value is calculated are given in Appendix. Finally, <span class="math">\\iota</span> does not affect our</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">analysis here. Therefore, to have our pairs with the same relation at the end of the 5th round, there are two ways this event may occur. Either the pairs enter into the 5th round with the same relation and <span class="math">\\chi</span> does not spoil it or they enter into the 5th round with the opposite relation and <span class="math">\\chi</span> ‘fixes’ it. Then the total probability <span class="math">P_{c}</span> for the chosen pair at the end of the 5th round is:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">P_{c}=0.53125\\cdot 0.49902375+(1-0.53125)\\cdot(1-0.49902375)=0.499938984</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For a random permutation, <span class="math">P_{c}</span> follows the binomial distribution with the probability of success <span class="math">s=0.5</span> — very close to <span class="math">0.499938984</span>. Then the bias for 5-round Keccak-<span class="math">f[1600]</span> is expected to be very small. To experimentally verify and observe the bias we need to check many rotational pairs. A sufficient number of rotational pairs <span class="math">m</span> is calculated from Chernoff bound <em>[7]</em> and can be expressed as the following inequality:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">m\\geq\\frac{1}{(P_{c}-0.5)^{2}}\\ln\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}},</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">\\epsilon</span> is the probability of an error of the bound (typically set to <span class="math">0.05</span>). From the inequality we have <span class="math">m\\geq 402\\,332\\,890\\approx 2^{28.6}</span> and in the experiment we checked <span class="math">403\\,000\\,000</span> rotational pairs. The distinguisher we implemented can be described in a few short steps:</p>

    </ol>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">mean:=mean+1;</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The mean from the experiment was equal to <span class="math">201\\,450\\,503</span>.

Hence we conclude we have a distinguisher for the 5-round Keccak-<span class="math">f[1600]</span> permutation.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-15" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.3 5-round distinguisher with lower complexity</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The idea allowing us to reduce the complexity of the 5-round distinguisher is to start not from a rotational pair of states but from the pair of states (called ‘good’ states) which after one round gives the rotational pair. First diagram in Figure 4 shows the structure which is used to generate a pair of ‘good’ states. Now we explain how we construct this structure. (A rotational number <span class="math">n</span> is set to <span class="math">63</span> in the following explanation but for any other <span class="math">n</span> the logic of construction stays the same.)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">On the way to the rotational pair from a pair of ‘good’ states the following should happen:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li><span class="math">\\iota</span> from the first round flips the value of <span class="math">p_{(0,0,0)}^{63}</span> and <span class="math">p_{(0,0,1)}^{63}</span>. Thus to get the rotational pair after <span class="math">\\iota</span>, there have to be <span class="math">p_{(0,0,0)}^{63}=1</span>, <span class="math">p_{(0,0,1)}^{63}=1</span> and for all other <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{63}=0</span> before <span class="math">\\iota</span> step.</li>

      <li>We want that <span class="math">p_{(0,0,0)}^{63}=1</span>, <span class="math">p_{(0,0,1)}^{63}=1</span> and all other <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{63}=0</span> are going to <span class="math">\\chi</span> and <span class="math">\\chi</span> does not change any of <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{63}</span>. This way <span class="math">\\iota</span> gets the right <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{63}</span> to produce the rotational pair.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However <span class="math">\\chi</span> is a non-linear operation and to have the condition fulfilled, some <span class="math">A_{(x,y,z)}</span> and <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}_{(x,y,z+n)}</span> have to be fixed. To have values fixed at this point it has to be taken under consideration at the beginning of the first round. Once we know the relation of the states <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}</span> before <span class="math">\\chi</span> step, it is easy to go back till the beginning of the round. It is because <span class="math">\\pi</span>, <span class="math">\\rho</span> and <span class="math">\\theta</span> are all linear operations and they change the rotational relation with probability <span class="math">1</span>. Thus we simply</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">invert these three operations to get the rotational relation at the beginning of the first round. Figure 4 shows a 1-round transition to a rotational pair where exact positions of the fixed bits are marked. The values of fixed bits which lead to this transition are given in Appendix.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We hoped that this 1-round transition to a rotational pair would give one more round in the distinguisher. However it is not the case and the problem is that the constant of the second round has the Hamming weight 3 (and not 1 as for the first round). More 1's in the round constant introduce more  <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^n = 1</span>  which subsequently cause more  <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^n</span>  with undesirable value of 0.5. Yet this 1-round transition can be used to lower the complexity of the 5-round distinguisher. Similarly as in the distinguisher from the previous section, we are interested in the pair of  <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^n</span>  at the end of 4th round which are in the same column and whose values deviate from 0.5. For a rotational number  <span class="math">n</span>  set to 63, we find an excellent pair where both  <span class="math">p_{(4,3,22)}^{63}</span>  and  <span class="math">p_{(4,4,22)}^{63}</span>  are equal to 0. We calculate  <span class="math">P_c</span>  in exactly the same way as in Section 3.2 but this time the total probability  <span class="math">P_c</span>  is much higher and is equal to 0.53125. Putting this value to the Chernoff inequality, we calculate the number of pairs  <span class="math">m</span>  needed to detect the bias and obtain  <span class="math">m \\geq 1534 \\approx 2^{11}</span> . Around  <span class="math">2^{11}</span>  needed pairs make the complexity of the distinguisher roughly equal  <span class="math">2^{12}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Trying to win more rounds by 'going backwards' by 2 (or more) rounds is problematic. Either we end up with all fixed bits at the beginning of the distinguisher (then in fact is not a structural distinguisher any more), or if we assume that transitions can be probabilistic the complexity of the distinguisher becomes much higher than the complexity of the generic 'attack'. We also tried</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">the approach where each undesirable <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}=0.5</span> becomes 0 with probability <span class="math">2^{-1}</span>. However, we could not reach anything better than 5 rounds without exceeding the generic complexity.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-16" class="text-2xl font-bold">4 Preimage attacks on round-reduced Keccak</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">First, we describe the preimage attack on 3-round Keccak-512 which is based on the rotational distinguisher given in the previous section. Then we show how to extend the attack to 4 rounds. To have the attack working on Keccak hash function, we have to consider padding and Keccak parameters. Let us consider Keccak-512 which has <span class="math">r=576</span>, <span class="math">c=1024</span> and a hash length set to 512 bits. For the preimage attack we propose the following structure of the message. A message length is 574 bits, where first 8 lanes (512 bits) are unknown (to be determined by the attacker). Last 62 bits of the message are set to 1. The message is padded with two 1’s giving a block of 576 bits. This way we fulfil a condition that all lanes (except first 8 lanes) have all 0’s or 1’s. We would use similar constraints on a message when attacking Keccak with different parameters (including all Keccak variants proposed as SHA-3 candidates).</p>

    <h3 id="sec-17" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.1 3-round preimage attack</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The goal of our attack is to find a preimage for a given 512-bit hash <span class="math">h</span>. In the structure of the message described above we have 512 unknown bits, then we can expect that among <span class="math">2^{512}</span> possible messages there is, on average, one with a given hash. The main idea of our attack is to find a rotational counterpart of the preimage and show that the workload for this task is below exhaustively trying all <span class="math">2^{512}</span> values. Once we have a rotational counterpart of the preimage, we simply rotate it back and get the preimage.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As stated in Remark 1, for a given state there are up to 64 possible rotational pairs (including the identity function). There are 512 unknown preimage bits in the state <span class="math">A</span>, then the probability that we guess one of the rotational counterpart <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}</span> is <span class="math">2^{-512}\\cdot 64=2^{-506}</span>. Thus we need <span class="math">2^{506}</span> guesses. There is a subtlety here which should be mentioned. There are some messages which have fewer than 64 rotations. These ‘special’ messages have a cyclic pattern. For example a message starting with four 0’s then four 1’s, then four 0’s and so on. However, the number of ‘special’ messages is relatively small in comparison to <span class="math">2^{512}</span>. It can be shown there are <span class="math">2^{256}</span> such messages for our case. (See Appendix for detailed analysis.) For simplicity, we can start our attack with checking <span class="math">2^{256}</span> these special messages. Then there are still almost <span class="math">2^{512}</span> possibilities left, but at least we are sure that in this poll each state gives 64 rotational pairs.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To make our attack working, at the end of the 3rd round we need some <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}=0</span> or <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}=1</span> for each rotational number <span class="math">n</span>. In the precomputation phase of the attack we generate 64 diagrams (the same as shown in Figure 3), each with a different rotational number <span class="math">n</span>. From these diagrams for each rotational number <span class="math">n</span> we make a list of 10 sets of coordinates <span class="math">(x,y,z)</span> for which <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}</span> equals 0 or 1 at the end of the 3rd round. Please note that we have to consider only <span class="math">(x,y,z)</span> such that <span class="math">64x+320y+z&lt;512</span> because the attacker knows only 512 bits of a hash (not the whole 1600-bit state).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Here is the main loop of the attack given in the following pseudo-code:</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>guess first 8 lanes (512 bits) of the state <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}</span>, the other bits are fixed according to the structure of the message given above.</li>

      <li>run 3-round Keccak-<span class="math">f[1600]</span> on the state <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}</span>.</li>

      <li>for <span class="math">n:=0</span> to <span class="math">n&lt;64</span> do</li>

    </ol>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li><em>candidate</em> := true;</li>

      <li>for all 10 sets of coordinates <span class="math">(x,y,z)</span> being on the list created in precomputation do</li>

    </ol>

    <p class="text-gray-300">if <span class="math">(p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}=0)</span> and <span class="math">(A_{(x,y,z)}\\neq A_{(x,y,z+n)}^{\\leftarrow})</span> then <span class="math">candidate:=</span> false; if <span class="math">(p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}=1)</span> and <span class="math">(A_{(x,y,z)}=A_{(x,y,z+n)}^{\\leftarrow})</span> then <span class="math">candidate:=</span> false;</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>if (candidate=true) then rotate back the guessed state by <span class="math">n</span> bits and run 3-round Keccak-512 on it to check whether the state is the preimage of a given hash.</li>

    </ol>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The attacker compares the probabilities <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}</span> from the distinguisher with the actual values of <span class="math">A</span> (the given hash) and <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}</span> state (a result of 3-round Keccak-512 on a guessed state). So, for example, if <span class="math">p_{(2,3,1)}^{n}=0</span>, then the bits <span class="math">A_{(2,3,1)}</span> and <span class="math">A_{(2,3,1+n)}^{\\leftarrow}</span> have to be the same. If the bits are different, then the candidate is rejected as a potential rotational counterpart of the preimage. (It is the point in the pseudo-code where a variable <span class="math">candidate</span> becomes false.)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As said earlier, running the main loop <span class="math">2^{506}</span> times, we should get one rotational counterpart of the preimage. It could be the case that our guess (candidate) of a rotational counterpart is not rejected, but in fact it is not a rotational counterpart. Let us call it a false positive candidate. There will be many such false positive candidates and the number of them is calculated as follows. For each rotational number <span class="math">n</span> there is a list of 10 sets of <span class="math">(x,y,z)</span> (created in precomputation) for which <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}</span> equals 0 or 1. A probability that we hit on a candidate for which all 10 values of <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}</span> are the same as on the list is <span class="math">2^{-10}</span>. Hence there will be around <span class="math">2^{512}/2^{10}=2^{502}</span> false positive candidates to check.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Now let us analyze the workload of inner loops. For each candidate there are 64 rotational numbers <span class="math">n</span>, and for each <span class="math">n</span> there are 10 sets of coordinates to check. Checking one set of coordinates can be implemented with 3 bitwise XOR operations. So the workload of inner loops is roughly <span class="math">64\\cdot 10\\cdot 3=1920</span> XOR operations. This workload is negligibly small as in the single step <span class="math">\\theta</span> (in a single round) there are 3200 bitwise XOR operations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Summing up, the workload of the attack is <span class="math">2^{256}</span> (checking special messages) + <span class="math">2^{506}</span> (main loop) + <span class="math">2^{502}</span> (checking false positive candidates). Thus complexity of the attack is roughly <span class="math">2^{506}</span> Keccak-512 calls, 64 times better than the exhaustive search.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-18" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.2 Extension to 4-round preimage attack</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A direct extension of the attack to 4 rounds is not possible since there are not any <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}=0</span> or <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}=1</span> at the end of the 4th round of the rotational distinguisher. (As said earlier, we need some <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}</span> equals 0 or 1 for mounting the attack.)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is easy to notice from Figure 3 that <span class="math">\\iota</span> flips some <span class="math">p_{(0,0,z)}^{n}</span> and in consequence it leads to undesirable <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}=0.5</span>. Then if we could limit this effect, hopefully some <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}=0</span> or <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}=1</span> would be kept till the end of the 4th round and make the attack work for 4 rounds. To realize this, we do the following. We trace the rotational relations between <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}</span> (as in previous sections), but this time <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}</span> is run on the modified version of Keccak-<span class="math">f[1600]</span> — Keccak-<span class="math">f[1600]</span> without <span class="math">\\iota</span>. Such a modification leads to the following observation.</p>

    <h6 id="sec-19" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Observation 2</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In Example 1, Section 3 it was shown that application of <span class="math">\\iota</span> to <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}</span> states flips the value <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}</span> for some triples <span class="math">(x,y,z)</span>. Our point is that if we do not apply <span class="math">\\iota</span> to an <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}</span> state, there will be half as many flips. (It is not a general rule but for constants with very low Hamming weight there are roughly half as many flips.) Let us see a simple example.</p>

    <h6 id="sec-20" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Example 2</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let us consider two 8-bit lanes <span class="math">A_{(0,0)}</span> and <span class="math">A_{(0,0)}^{\\leftarrow}</span> with the rotational number <span class="math">n=3</span>. The lanes have the following binary values: <span class="math">A_{(0,0)}=00000010</span> and <span class="math">A_{(0,0)}^{\\leftarrow}=00010000</span>. Now <span class="math">A_{(0,0)}</span> is xored with 8-bit constant <span class="math">C=00000001</span> and <span class="math">A_{(0,0)}^{\\leftarrow}</span> is left without changes. Then we have <span class="math">A_{(0,0)}=00000011</span> and the unchanged <span class="math">A_{(0,0)}^{\\leftarrow}=00010000</span>. Therefore a rotational relation has been spoilt at only one position so now <span class="math">p_{(0,0,0)}^{3}</span> is equal to 1. In Keccak-<span class="math">f[1600]</span> the constants are 64-bit long but the reasoning shown here stays the same.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Now is the key point. As stated earlier, fewer flips lead to fewer <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}</span> with undesirable 0.5 value. In consequence, now in the 4th round there are 9 triples <span class="math">(x,y,z)</span> for which <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}=0</span> or <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}=1</span>. These triples fulfil the condition <span class="math">64x+320y+z&lt;512</span> as the attacker is given only 512 bits of a hash. In fact <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}=0</span> or <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}=1</span> are not at the end of the 4th round but before <span class="math">\\chi</span> in the 4th round. (Step <span class="math">\\chi</span> destroys these desirable probabilities.) Fortunately, we can invert <span class="math">\\iota</span> and <span class="math">\\chi</span> from the given hash as <span class="math">\\chi</span> operates on the rows independently and can be inverted on a row-by-row basis. In Appendix we give a diagram showing how the probabilities <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}</span> evolve and propagate in the modified version of Keccak-<span class="math">f[1600]</span> without <span class="math">\\iota</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In precomputation phase we generate the list of sets of coordinates in the very similar way as described for the 3-round attack. The only difference is that now we use the diagram dedicated to the modified version of Keccak-<span class="math">f[1600]</span> (without <span class="math">\\iota</span>). The diagram and exact positions where <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}</span> equals 0 or 1 is given in Appendix. Also in precomputation we invert <span class="math">\\iota</span> and <span class="math">\\chi</span> of the 4th round from the given hash (since these desirable <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}</span> are before <span class="math">\\chi</span> in the 4th round, <span class="math">\\chi</span> destroys them). The result of the inversion is now our state <span class="math">A</span> to which we refer in the pseudo-code of the attack.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Here is the main loop of the attack given in the following pseudo-code:</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>guess first 8 lanes (512 bits) of the state <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}</span>, the other bits are fixed according to the structure of the message given above.</li>

      <li>run 4-round modified Keccak-<span class="math">f[1600]</span> on the state <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}</span></li>

      <li>for <span class="math">n:=0</span> to <span class="math">n&lt;64</span> do</li>

    </ol>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>candidate <span class="math">:=</span> true;</li>

      <li>for all 9 sets of coordinates <span class="math">(x,y,z)</span> being on the list created in precomputation do</li>

    </ol>

    <p class="text-gray-300">if <span class="math">(p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}=0)</span> and <span class="math">(A_{(x,y,z)}\\neq A_{(x,y,z+n)}^{\\leftarrow})</span> then <span class="math">candidate:=</span> false; if <span class="math">(p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}=1)</span> and <span class="math">(A_{(x,y,z)}=A_{(x,y,z+n)}^{\\leftarrow})</span> then <span class="math">candidate:=</span> false;</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>if (candidate<span class="math">=</span>true) then rotate back the guessed state by <span class="math">n</span> bits and run 4-round Keccak-512 on it to check whether the state is the preimage of a given hash.</li>

    </ol>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The main loop of the 4-round preimage attack on Keccak-512 is very similar to the 3-round variant, they differ only in a few places. In Step 2 of the pseudo-code instead of running a normal, full 4-round Keccak-<span class="math">f[1600]</span>, we run the modified version without <span class="math">\\iota</span> (in all 4 rounds) up to <span class="math">\\chi</span> in the 4th round. Finally, there will two times more false positive candidates as there are only 9 triples <span class="math">(x,y,z)</span> for which <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}=0</span> or <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}=1</span>. The complexity of the attack stays the same as in the 3-round attack. That is <span class="math">2^{256}</span> (checking special messages) + <span class="math">2^{506}</span> (main loop) + <span class="math">2^{503}</span> (checking false positive candidates), which is amounts roughly to <span class="math">2^{506}</span> evaluations of the 4-round Keccak-512.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For Keccak-512, the preimage attack is better than the exhaustive search by a factor of <span class="math">2^{6}</span>. The same gain can be achieved in the attack on Keccak-384. Our preimage attack works also on Keccak-256 and Keccak-224 but the gain is slightly smaller for these variants. The reason is that there are more false positive candidates to check. It is because an attacker knows fewer bits of a hash (a hash is shorter in these variants) and hence there are fewer triples <span class="math">(x,y,z)</span> (fewer than in Keccak-512 and Keccak-384) for which <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}=0</span> or <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^{n}=1</span>. Consequently, the complexities of the preimage attacks on Keccak-224 and Keccak-256 are <span class="math">2^{221}</span> and <span class="math">2^{252}</span>, respectively.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Please also note that if we try to attack Keccak variant with higher bitrate <span class="math">r</span> (e.g. a variant with <span class="math">r=600</span>, <span class="math">c=1000</span>, and a hash length equals 512), the claimed security for this variant is <span class="math">2^{c/2}=2^{500}</span>. In such a case our attack would not be actually an attack as its complexity is higher than the claimed security provided by designers.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We could not extend the attack to 5 or more rounds because in the 5th round all <span class="math">p^{n}_{(x,y,z)}=0.5</span>, while for the attack we need some <span class="math">p^{n}_{(x,y,z)}=0</span> or <span class="math">p^{n}_{(x,y,z)}=1</span>.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-21" class="text-2xl font-bold">5 Conclusion</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper we have presented the rotational distinguisher for Keccak-<span class="math">f</span>[1600] permutation — the main building block of the Keccak hash function. The distinguisher has been enhanced with the correlation analysis, allowing us to reach 5 rounds with the complexity of <span class="math">2^{12}</span>. We have implemented and verified the distinguisher and experimental results have been consistent with the theoretical model. A family of 4-round distinguishers helps us to mount the 4-round preimage attack on Keccak-512 variant with the complexity of <span class="math">2^{506}</span>. All the presented attacks are valid for all the Keccak variants submitted as SHA-3 candidates. As future work, it would be interesting to investigate whether the differential rebound attack could improve the rotational distinguishers. These two types of analysis (rebound and rotational) were combined in the attacks on Skein hash function <em>[13]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Analyzing the AND operation we consider two pairs of input bits. A pair from an  <span class="math">A</span>  state and its counterpart from an  <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}</span>  state. There are 16 possible combinations of pairs and we group them in fours. We assume that all pairs of bits inside the groups are uniformly distributed. It is shown in Figure 5. Probabilities of getting the given group are also shown. The most inner circles represent pair of output bits (one bit from an  <span class="math">A</span>  state and its counterpart from an  <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}</span>  state). It is clear from Figure 5 that four paths lead to a circle with output bits having opposite values (pairs  <span class="math">(0,1)</span>  and  <span class="math">(1,0)</span> ). Actually, one path has probability 0 thus a calculation of  <span class="math">P_{out}</span>  (a probability that output bits have opposite values) comes down to adding probabilities of the three paths. We have:</p>

Each of these two pairs has the relation between its bits (that is bits have either the same or opposite values). We can also look at relation between pairs and there are two possibilities: either the same relation in both pairs or different relation in each pair. For example a pair  <span class="math">(0,1)</span>  and a pair  <span class="math">(1,0)</span>  means that relations in both pairs is the same (bits are different in pairs).

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">P = (1 - p _ {a}) (1 - p _ {b}) \\cdot 1 + p _ {a} p _ {b} \\cdot \\frac {1}{2} + (1 - p _ {a}) p _ {b} \\cdot \\frac {1}{2} + (1 - p _ {b}) p _ {a} \\cdot \\frac {1}{2}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the 5th round, after  <span class="math">\\theta</span>  all  <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^n = \\frac{1}{2}</span> , then a numerical value of  <span class="math">p</span>  is:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">P = (1 - \\frac {1}{2}) (1 - \\frac {1}{2}) 1 + \\frac {1}{2} \\frac {1}{2} \\frac {1}{2} + (1 - \\frac {1}{2}) \\frac {1}{2} \\frac {1}{2} + (1 - \\frac {1}{2}) \\frac {1}{2} \\frac {1}{2} = \\frac {5}{8}</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the second rotational pair calculations are exactly the same with the result of  <span class="math">\\frac{5}{8}</span> . The event that  <span class="math">\\chi</span>  preserves the relation between the first and second pair can happen either when the relation in each pair is preserved or the relation in each pair is spoilt. Thus the probability of this event is equal to:</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">P _ {e v e n t} = \\frac {5}{8} \\cdot \\frac {5}{8} + (1 - \\frac {5}{8}) (1 - \\frac {5}{8}) = \\frac {3 4}{6 4} = 0. 5 3 1 2 5</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Bits given in tables below are set to 1. All other fixed bits which are not listed below (but are marked as fixed in Figure 4) are set to 0.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As a consequence of such settings, after  <span class="math">\\pi</span>  some bits have also fixed (known) values. Specifically,  <span class="math">A_{(1,0,0)}</span>  and  <span class="math">A_{(1,0,1)}</span>  with their rotational counterparts are equal to 0. Also  <span class="math">A_{(4,0,0)}</span>  and  <span class="math">A_{(4,0,1)}</span>  with their rotational counterparts are fixed, equal to 1. With this known values we are sure that the non-linear  <span class="math">\\chi</span>  changes the states into the desirable rotational relation, as shown in Figure 4.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">According to Definition 1 and Remark 1, for a given state  <span class="math">A</span>  there are up to 64 possible rotational pairs (including an identity function). There are some messages which have fewer than 64 rotations. These special messages must have a cyclic pattern (e.g. alternating four 1's and four 0's) in all lanes. All 0's or all 1's in the given lane are also considered cyclic here. Please note that if at least one lane in a state  <span class="math">A</span>  is not cyclic then there are exactly 64 possible rotational pairs  <span class="math">(A, A^{\\leftarrow})</span> . It is because this non-cyclic lane is distinct for each rotational number  <span class="math">n</span>  and consequently the whole  <span class="math">A^{\\leftarrow}</span>  will be distinct.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For a 64-bit lane there are  <span class="math">2^{32}</span>  cyclic patterns. In our preimage attack there are 8 unknown lanes in the  <span class="math">A</span>  state (remaining lanes are fixed and cyclic), so the number of combinations of cyclic patterns in these 8 lanes is:  <span class="math">\\underbrace{2^{32} \\cdot 2^{32} \\ldots \\cdot 2^{32}}_{8\\text{ factors}} = 2^{256}</span> . And hence the number of special messages is  <span class="math">2^{256}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 7 shows how probabilities  <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^n</span>  change in the modified KECCAK variant (without  <span class="math">\\iota</span> ). The variant was used in 4-round preimage attack. Please note that in the 4th round, after  <span class="math">\\theta</span> , there are still  <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^n = 0</span>  or  <span class="math">p_{(x,y,z)}^n = 1</span>  which is the key observation for the 4-round preimage attack.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Abstract. Miyaji, Nakabayashi and Takano (MNT) gave families of group orders of ordinary elliptic curves with embedding degree suitable for pairing applications. In this paper we generalise their results by giving families corresponding to non-prime group orders. We also consider the case of ordinary abelian varieties of dimension 2. We give families of group orders with embedding degrees 5, 10 and 12.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">E</span> be an elliptic curve over a finite field <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> and suppose that</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\# E(\\mathbb{F}_q) = n = hr,</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">r</span> is the largest prime divisor of <span class="math">n</span>. (For cases of interest, <span class="math">h</span> will be 'small'.) Define the embedding degree to be the smallest positive integer <span class="math">k</span> such that</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">r \\mid q^k - 1.</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In other words, <span class="math">k</span> is minimal such that <span class="math">r \\mid \\varPhi_k(q)</span> where <span class="math">\\varPhi_k(x)</span> is the <span class="math">k</span>-th cyclotomic polynomial (see Section VI.3 of Lang [11]). The Weil pairing is a function</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">e: E[r] \\times E[r] \\to \\mu_r \\subset \\mathbb{F}_q^*,</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">\\mu_r</span> is the set of <span class="math">r</span>-th roots of unity in <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q^*</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Currently one of the most active areas in elliptic curve cryptography is the use of the Weil and Tate pairings to construct cryptographic protocols. A fundamental problem in this area is to construct elliptic curves <span class="math">E</span> such that the embedding degree <span class="math">k</span> is of a suitable size.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One popular solution to the problem is to use supersingular curves. In characteristic two there are curves which allow <span class="math">k = 4</span>, while in characteristic three there are curves which allow <span class="math">k = 6</span>. Efficient implementations using these curves have been developed [2, 7, 10]. There are, however, some unfortunate problems with this approach. First, there are only a small number of suitable group orders available. Second, due to Coppersmith's index calculus method for discrete</p>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">logarithms in finite fields of low characteristic, the field sizes should be larger than those used in the case of large prime characteristic.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Hence it is attractive to use ordinary (i.e., non-supersingular) curves. This is made possible by the important paper of Miyaji, Nakabayashi and Takano [12]. They give families of group orders of ordinary curves with embedding degrees 3, 4 and 6.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper we extend the methods of Miyaji, Nakabayashi and Takano (MNT) in two directions. First, we obtain a larger class of families by incorporating cofactors into the analysis. This idea has also been used by Scott and Barreto [15], although they do not give explicit families.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The second direction taken in the paper is to consider abelian varieties of dimension two. Supersingular abelian varieties have already been proposed for pairing-based cryptography [9, 13]. For example, one can obtain embedding degree 12 from a supersingular abelian surface in characteristic two. We give heuristics which suggest that suitable ordinary abelian surfaces exist. We describe our search for families and give some results. One interesting observation is that the embedding degree 12 cases in characteristic two can also be realised using ordinary abelian varieties.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 1. MNT families</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In each case,  <span class="math">q(l)</span>  is a quadratic polynomial in  <span class="math">l</span>  that (heuristically) represents  <span class="math">\\theta(\\sqrt{X} / \\log X)</span>  prime powers below  <span class="math">X</span> . We refer to such families as quadratic families. Note the requirement on the heuristic density of prime powers represented by  <span class="math">q(l)</span> : quadratic polynomials such as  <span class="math">-l^2 + 17</span> ,  <span class="math">6(l^2 + l + 1)</span> , or  <span class="math">2l^2</span>  would not satisfy this condition (the last of these (provably!) represents infinitely many prime powers, but with the wrong density), whereas  <span class="math">q(l) = l^2</span>  would be fine if it arose.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">3 Generalisation to cofactors</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The MNT results in the previous section cover the cases where <span class="math">n=\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{q})</span> satisfies <span class="math">n\\mid\\Phi_{k}(q)</span>. This is most relevant cryptographically for the case where <span class="math">n</span> is prime. However, in cryptography we are also interested in cases where the group order is ‘nearly prime’, i.e., when <span class="math">n=\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{q})=hr</span> where <span class="math">h&gt;1</span> is small, and <span class="math">r</span> is a prime. We then require merely that <span class="math">r\\mid\\Phi_{k}(q)</span>, and call <span class="math">h</span> the cofactor. In fact we do not mind if <span class="math">r</span> itself is a small multiple of a prime, and we can therefore insist that <span class="math">\\gcd(h,\\Phi_{k}(q))=1</span>, else we could reduce to a case with smaller <span class="math">h</span>. We define <span class="math">\\lambda</span> by the equation <span class="math">\\Phi_{k}(q)=\\lambda r</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Some earlier work on cofactors appears in <em>[15]</em>, but they do not give explicit families. Here we generalise the MNT argument to allow for cofactors, indicating how all curves with prescribed cofactor and embedding degree may be found. Other generalisations of the MNT approach have been given in <em>[3, 6]</em>.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-4" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.1 The details in the case <span class="math">k=6</span></h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We require <span class="math">\\lambda r=\\Phi_{6}(q)=q^{2}-q+1</span>. Applying the same idea as in <em>[12]</em>, we observe that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">n(h(q+1+t)-\\lambda)=h(q+1-t)(q+1+t)-hr\\lambda=h(3q-t^{2}).</span> (1)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Dividing by <span class="math">qh</span> gives</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\frac{n}{q}\\big{(}(q+1+t)-\\lambda/h\\big{)}=3-\\frac{t^{2}}{q}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and Hasse’s bound for the number of points yields</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">-4/3&lt;(q+1+t)-\\lambda/h&lt;3\\,,</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">for <span class="math">q&gt;64</span>. (Hasse’s bound readily yields <span class="math">q/n&lt;4/3</span> for large enough <span class="math">q</span>, which with <span class="math">3-t^{2}/q\\geq-1</span> yields the lower bound. For the upper bound, suppose instead that <span class="math">(q/n)(3-t^{2}/q)\\geq 3</span>. With <span class="math">n=q+1-t</span> this gives <span class="math">t^{2}-3t+3\\leq 0</span>, which has no real solutions.)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Define <span class="math">w=\\lfloor\\lambda/h\\rfloor</span> and <span class="math">\\epsilon=\\lambda/h-w</span> so that <span class="math">\\lambda=(w+\\epsilon)h</span>. We may assume that <span class="math">\\epsilon&gt;0</span> since if <span class="math">h\\mid\\lambda</span> then <span class="math">n=hr\\mid\\Phi_{6}(q)</span> and we are in the original MNT case. Furthermore, we may assume that <span class="math">\\gcd(h,\\lambda)=1</span> or else we reduce to a case with smaller <span class="math">h</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">-4/3+\\epsilon&lt;q+1+t-w&lt;3+\\epsilon&lt;4</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and so <span class="math">v:=q+1+t-w\\in\\{-1,0,1,2,3\\}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Now substitute into equation (1) to obtain the quadratic</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">t^{2}-t(v-\\epsilon)+(q+1)(v-\\epsilon)-3q.</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The solutions to this equation are</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">t=\\frac{v-\\epsilon\\pm\\sqrt{\\sigma(q,\\epsilon)}}{2}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\sigma(q,\\epsilon)=(v-\\epsilon)^{2}+12q-4(q+1)(v-\\epsilon).</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since we want <span class="math">t</span> to be an integer it follows that <span class="math">\\sqrt{\\sigma(q,\\epsilon)}</span> must be of the form <span class="math">a\\pm\\epsilon</span> for some integer <span class="math">a</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This equation alone does not provide much information, so we consider each possible value for <span class="math">v</span> separately. Writing <span class="math">\\epsilon=\\frac{u}{h}</span> with <span class="math">u,h</span> co-prime and fixing <span class="math">v\\in\\{-1,0,1,2,3\\}</span> gives the formulae presented in Table 2. In fact when <span class="math">v=-1</span>, and <span class="math">h\\geq 2</span>, we have that <span class="math">h\\epsilon</span> is a positive integer, and hence that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">r\\leq h\\epsilon r=(t^{2}-4q)+t-1\\leq t-1=O(\\sqrt{q})\\,,</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Recall that we want <span class="math">h^{2}\\sigma(q,u/h)</span> to be an integer square, say <span class="math">x^{2}</span>. It is helpful to write <span class="math">h^{2}\\sigma(q,u/h)</span> as <span class="math">M(u,h)+N(u,h)q</span>. Our condition that <span class="math">h^{2}\\sigma(q,u/h)=x^{2}</span> then gives rise to the requirement that <span class="math">M(u,h)</span> be a quadratic residue modulo <span class="math">N(u,h)</span>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 3. Values of <span class="math">M(u,h)</span> and <span class="math">N(u,h)</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We now consider particular values for <span class="math">h</span> in turn.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">3.2 Curves with cofactor <span class="math">h=2</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The case of cofactor <span class="math">h=2</span> is the simplest case. The group order of such a curve is <span class="math">\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{q})=2r</span> where <span class="math">r\\mid(q^{2}-q+1)</span>. If <span class="math">2r\\mid(q^{2}-q+1)</span> then this case is covered by Miyaji et al. So we assume that <span class="math">2r\\nmid(q^{2}-q+1)</span>. In this case <span class="math">u=1</span> and <span class="math">\\epsilon=1/2</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The first stage is to deduce which values for <span class="math">v</span> are permissible. Substituting <span class="math">(u,h)=(1,2)</span> into table 3 gives the following analysis.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We obtain <span class="math">x^{2}\\equiv 9\\pmod{8\\cdot 7}</span> and so <span class="math">x=\\pm 3+14l</span>. Now, the equation <span class="math">x^{2}=h^{2}\\sigma(q,1/2)=9+56q</span> implies that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">q=\\frac{l(\\pm 3+7l)}{2}.</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One can deduce the corresponding values of <span class="math">t</span> from the formula <span class="math">t=(hv-u\\pm x)/(2h)</span> and obtain</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">t=\\frac{1\\pm 7l}{2}\\ \\ \\text{or}\\ \\ t=-1\\pm\\frac{7l}{2}.</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since the expression for <span class="math">q</span> splits in <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}[l]</span> this case is not useful for producing large prime values for <span class="math">q</span>. In fact, the only possible choices are <span class="math">l=2</span> which gives <span class="math">(q,t)=(17,-8)</span> with group order <span class="math">2\\cdot 13</span> and <span class="math">l=3</span>, which gives <span class="math">(q,t)=(3^{3},-10)</span> with group order <span class="math">2\\cdot 19</span>. This case yields no solutions since <span class="math">x^{2}\\equiv-7\\pmod{8\\cdot 5}</span> is insoluble. The condition in this case is <span class="math">x^{2}\\equiv-15\\pmod{8\\cdot 3}</span> and so <span class="math">x=3+6l</span>, From <span class="math">9(1+2l)^{2}=24q-15</span> we deduce that <span class="math">q=(3l^{2}+3l+2)/2</span>, which is irreducible in <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}[l]</span>. The full parameterised family is</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">q</span> <span class="math">=\\frac{3l^{2}+3l+2}{2}</span> <span class="math">t</span> <span class="math">=\\frac{3+3l}{2}\\ \\text{or}\\ t=\\frac{-3l}{2}.</span> The congruence is <span class="math">x^{2}\\equiv-15\\pmod{8}</span> which implies <span class="math">x=1+2l</span> and <span class="math">q=(l^{2}+l+4)/2</span>. Again this is irreducible in <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}[l]</span>. The full parameterised family is</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">q</span> <span class="math">=\\frac{l^{2}+l+4}{2}</span> <span class="math">t</span> <span class="math">=\\frac{3+l}{2}\\ \\text{or}\\ t=1-\\frac{l}{2}.</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We have therefore produced two quadratic families of ordinary elliptic curves with cofactor <span class="math">2</span> and embedding degree <span class="math">6</span>. Since we wish for <span class="math">t</span> to be an integer, and for <span class="math">q</span> to represent prime powers, we can place certain congruence conditions on <span class="math">l</span> in each case. When this is done, <span class="math">q</span> and <span class="math">t</span> are expressed as polynomials in <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}[l]</span>, and these are the <span class="math">(q,t)</span> pairs presented in the tables below.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using similar analysis for cofactors up to <span class="math">5</span>, and some MAGMA <em>[5]</em> code, we get the following theorem.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Theorem 1. The only quadratic families of elliptic curves that have embedding degree 3, 4, or 6, and cofactor  <span class="math">h</span>  in the range  <span class="math">2 \\leq h \\leq 5</span>  are those given by tables 4, 5 and 6.

    <p class="text-gray-300">These families cover all the examples found by Scott and Barreto in [15]. For  <span class="math">k = 6</span> ,  <span class="math">h = 4</span>  and  <span class="math">d = 13</span>  (in the notation of their paper) they produced a strikingly large number of examples. These ones come from our families  <span class="math">q(l) = 208l^2 + 30l + 1</span>  and  <span class="math">q(l) = 208l^2 + 126l + 19</span> , the first of which is particularly lucky in generating  <span class="math">(q, t)</span>  pairs for which the construction of a corresponding curve via Complex Multiplication works well.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Selecting one of these pairs  <span class="math">(q, t)</span> , it is possible to construct an elliptic curve  <span class="math">E / \\mathbb{F}_q</span>  with  <span class="math">q + 1 - t</span>  points by using Complex Multiplication (see, for example, [4] and [18]). We outline the preparatory details here.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Miyaji et al noted that, substituting  <span class="math">t</span>  and  <span class="math">q</span>  with the formulae they obtained, the problem corresponded to solving a general Pell equation.

    <p class="text-gray-300">This set contains the pairs <span class="math">(q,\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{q}))</span> as above which have embedding degree dividing <span class="math">k</span>, but for the moment we do not restrict to prime power values of <span class="math">q</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let us make the reasonable assumption that we expect <span class="math">n\\mid\\Phi_{k}(q)</span> with probability <span class="math">\\theta(1/n)</span>. (The number of solutions to <span class="math">\\Phi_{k}(x)\\equiv 0\\pmod{n}</span> behaves erratically as <span class="math">n</span> varies, but some recent work of Scourfield <em>[16]</em> shows that it is on average constant.) Now, approximating <span class="math">n\\approx M</span> we deduce that the number of points in <span class="math">S^{\\prime}</span> is roughly <span class="math">\\theta(1/M)</span> times the number of points in <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}^{2}\\cap S</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This heuristic is supported perfectly by the results in the elliptic curve case. There we find that (apart from a finite number of exceptional cases) the values <span class="math">q</span> are quadratic in a parameter <span class="math">l</span>, and each such <span class="math">q</span> yields two possible group orders <span class="math">n</span>.

Note that the quadratic families in question are not exactly those tabulated earlier: when <span class="math">k=3</span> (respectively <span class="math">6</span>) the relevant <span class="math">q(l)</span> is <span class="math">3l^{2}-1</span> (respectively <span class="math">l^{2}+1</span>).

    <p class="text-gray-300">Some related work to the above is the result of Balasubramanian and Koblitz <em>[1]</em> which implies that there are <span class="math">O(\\sqrt{M}(\\log M)^{9}(\\log\\log M)^{2})</span> isogeny classes of elliptic curves over <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{p}</span> with <span class="math">M/2\\leq p\\leq M</span>, <span class="math">\\#E(\\mathbb{F}_{p})=r</span> prime, and <span class="math">r\\mid(p^{k}-1)</span> for some <span class="math">k\\leq(\\log p)^{2}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The powerful arguments of Miyaji, Nakabayashi and Takano for elliptic curves do not seem to extend to higher dimensions. We shall now take an alternative approach, that although weaker does readily extend, and which will allow us to find infinite families for abelian varieties of dimension 2. In this section we introduce the ideas in the more familiar elliptic curve setting, and recover all the MNT families, before moving to dimension 2.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If we seek families with embedding degree <span class="math">k</span> (3, 4, or 6) where <span class="math">q(l)</span> is a quadratic polynomial in <span class="math">l</span>, then we are looking for</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\Phi_{k}(q(l))=n_{1}(l)n_{2}(l)\\,,</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">n_{1}(l)</span> and <span class="math">n_{2}(l)</span> are quadratic polynomials.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Ignoring any constraints on the leading coefficients, let us characterise those quadratic polynomials <span class="math">q(l)</span> with rational coefficients for which <span class="math">\\Phi_{k}(q(l))</span> splits over the rationals as a product of two quadratic polynomials. We give this for general <span class="math">k</span>, as we shall wish to consider <span class="math">k=5</span>, 8, 10, or 12 for the dimension 2 work.</p>

    <h6 id="sec-8" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Lemma 1.</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">q(l)</span> be a quadratic polynomial in <span class="math">l</span>, with rational coefficients, and let <span class="math">\\zeta_{k}</span> be a primitive complex <span class="math">k</span>-th root of unity. Then <span class="math">\\Phi_{k}(q(l))</span> splits over the rationals as a product of two irreducible polynomials of degree <span class="math">\\varphi(k)</span> (Euler’s totient function) precisely when the equation</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">q(z)=\\zeta_{k}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">has a solution in <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{k})</span>. Otherwise, <span class="math">\\Phi_{k}(q(l))</span> is irreducible over <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}</span>, of degree <span class="math">2\\varphi(k)</span>.</p>

    <h6 id="sec-9" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Proof.</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">\\theta</span> be any root of <span class="math">\\Phi_{k}(q(z))=0</span>. Then <span class="math">q(\\theta)=\\omega_{k}</span> is a primitive <span class="math">k</span>-th root of unity, and <span class="math">\\omega_{k}\\in\\mathbb{Q}(\\theta)</span>, and hence <span class="math">\\theta</span> has degree a multiple of <span class="math">\\varphi(k)</span> over <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}</span>. Moreover we see that <span class="math">\\theta</span> has degree <span class="math">\\varphi(k)</span> precisely when <span class="math">\\theta\\in\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega_{k})</span>, and otherwise has degree <span class="math">2\\varphi(k)</span>. Finally we note that <span class="math">\\theta\\in\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega_{k})</span> precisely when <span class="math">q(z)=\\omega_{k}</span> has a solution in <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega_{k})</span>, and by Galois conjugation this occurs precisely when <span class="math">q(z)=\\zeta_{k}</span> has a solution in <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{k})</span>. ∎</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The MNT families naturally fit into this picture:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li><span class="math">k=3</span>, <span class="math">q(l)=12l^{2}-1</span>. Here <span class="math">q(1/3+\\zeta_{3}/6)=\\zeta_{3}</span>.</li>

      <li><span class="math">k=4</span>, <span class="math">q(l)=l^{2}+l+1</span>. Here <span class="math">q(\\zeta_{4})=\\zeta_{4}</span>.</li>

      <li><span class="math">k=6</span>, <span class="math">q(l)=4l^{2}+1</span>. Here <span class="math">q(\\zeta_{6}/2)=\\zeta_{6}</span>.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Of course more is required than just the solubility of <span class="math">q(z)=\\zeta_{k}</span>, but this equation gives us a means of attack for the dimension 2 case. For example it immediately shows that no quadratic families exist for the case <span class="math">k=8</span>. Another alternative is simply to expand out the equation <span class="math">\\Phi_{k}(q(l))=n_{1}(l)n_{2}(l)</span> and attempt to solve the resulting Diophantine system. This is explored further in <em>[19]</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One can use this idea to find quickly all quadratic families (up to a linear change of variables; and most of these families will involve cofactors) <span class="math">q(l)=al^{2}+bl+c</span> with integer coefficients and embedding degree <span class="math">k=3</span>, 4, or 6, for any fixed <span class="math">a</span>. For example, consider <span class="math">k=6</span>. We seek <span class="math">q(z)=\\zeta_{6}</span> with <span class="math">z\\in\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{6})</span>. Writing <span class="math">2az+b=A+B\\zeta_{6}</span>, this leads to two quadratic equations:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">B(2A+B)=4a\\,,</span> <span class="math">A^{2}-B^{2}=b^{2}-4ac\\,.</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Noting that <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> must be integers, the first equation gives a finite set of possibilities for <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> (for fixed <span class="math">a</span>), and for each of these one can test the solvability of the second equation.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-10" class="text-2xl font-bold">6 Dimension 2: the general strategy</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Given the heuristics above, we now seek families in dimension 2 that are parameterised by quadratic polynomials. For convenience we specialise Lemma 1 to the cases that are now of interest:</p>

    <h6 id="sec-11" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Lemma 2.</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let <span class="math">k=5</span>, 8, 10, or 12, and let <span class="math">\\zeta_{k}</span> be a primitive complex <span class="math">k</span>-th root of unity. Let <span class="math">q(l)</span> be a quadratic polynomial in <span class="math">l</span> with rational coefficients. Then <span class="math">\\Phi_{k}(q(l))</span> splits over the rationals as a product of two irreducible quartic polynomials precisely when the equation</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">q(z)=\\zeta_{k}</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">has a solution in <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{k})</span>. Otherwise, <span class="math">\\Phi_{k}(q(l))</span> is an irreducible octic over <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To apply this Lemma, we suppose that <span class="math">az^{2}+bz+c=\\zeta_{k}</span> for some rational numbers <span class="math">a</span>, <span class="math">b</span>, <span class="math">c</span>, and some <span class="math">z\\in\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{k})</span>. Completing the square, and clearing denominators of all rational numbers (including those appearing in <span class="math">z</span>) we get an equation of the shape</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">a_{1}w^{2}+b_{1}=c_{1}\\zeta_{k}\\,,</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">a_{1}</span>, <span class="math">b_{1}</span>, <span class="math">c_{1}\\in\\mathbb{Z}</span>, and <span class="math">w\\in\\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta_{k}]</span>. Then since <span class="math">a_{1}</span> divides <span class="math">c_{1}\\zeta_{k}-b_{1}</span>, we must have that <span class="math">a_{1}</span> divides both <span class="math">c_{1}</span> and <span class="math">b_{1}</span>, so we are reduced to</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">w^{2}+b_{2}=c_{2}\\zeta_{k}\\,,</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Eliminating any one of the four variables (by computing a resultant), we get a homogeneous quartic in three variables. (In fact, by careful choice of the variable to be eliminated, we can produce a homogeneous cubic.) In each case this defines an elliptic curve (there is always a solution corresponding to <span class="math">a=c=0</span>). By studying the set of points on this elliptic curve, we learn about possible quadratic families of dimension 2 abelian varieties with embedding degree <span class="math">k</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Not every point on the elliptic curve gives rise to a quadratic family. The process of converting a point on the elliptic curve to a quadratic <span class="math">q(l)</span> may fail for any of the following reasons:</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>there may be points on the elliptic curve that do not lift back to points on both of the quadratic forms in <span class="math">A</span>, <span class="math">B</span>, <span class="math">C</span>, <span class="math">D</span>;</li>

      <li>a solution <span class="math">w=A+B\\zeta_{k}+C\\zeta_{k}^{2}+D\\zeta_{k}^{3}</span> may yield <span class="math">w^{2}\\in\\mathbb{Q}</span>, in which case the ‘quadratic’ polynomial <span class="math">q(l)</span> is in fact linear, in which case <span class="math">\\Phi_{k}(q(l))</span> does not split;</li>

      <li>we need <span class="math">-b_{2}</span> to be a square modulo <span class="math">c_{2}</span> if we are to find suitable integers <span class="math">a</span>, <span class="math">b</span>, <span class="math">c</span> (and note that if <span class="math">-b_{2}</span> is a square modulo <span class="math">c_{2}</span> then we may have more than one square-root to consider);</li>

      <li>even if all goes well and we find a quadratic <span class="math">q(l)</span> with <span class="math">\\Phi_{k}(q(l))</span> splitting, there may be no values of <span class="math">l</span> for which <span class="math">q(l)</span> is a prime power.</li>

    </ol>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The examples below will illustrate how one can patch things up if the two factors of <span class="math">\\Phi_{k}(q(l))</span> do not have the same leading coefficient.</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">q(l) = 6l^2.</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This can never equal a prime power.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since negating a point on the curve corresponds to replacing <span class="math">\\zeta_{12}</span> by <span class="math">-\\zeta_{12}</span>, another primitive 12th root of unity, the point <span class="math">(2:2:1)</span> merely repeats this family.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since <span class="math">-\\zeta_{12}</span> is also a primitive 12-th root, we may restrict to <span class="math">a &amp;gt; 0</span> without loss, and then <span class="math">a</span> must be twice a rational square; say <span class="math">a = 2t^2</span>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <span class="math">t</span> and <span class="math">s</span> are rational numbers, with <span class="math">t\\neq 0</span>. Up to a linear change of variable, we have just one family, with <span class="math">q(l)=2l^{2}</span>.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that the family <span class="math">q(l)=2l^{2}</span> is not a quadratic family, since <span class="math">l</span> must be restricted to powers of 2. Heuristically, most cases are not covered by this family.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">First treat the case A=0. If also <span class="math">B=0</span>, then <span class="math">(A:B:C:D)=(0:0:0:1)</span>, <span class="math">w=\\zeta_{5}^{3}</span>, and we find the infinite family <span class="math">q(l)=l^{2}</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This (at last!) really is a quadratic family: any prime (power) <span class="math">l</span> will make <span class="math">q(l)</span> a prime power. We then have <span class="math">n(l)=l^{4}\\pm l^{3}+l^{2}\\pm l+1</span>. It includes a supersingular family, with <span class="math">a_{1}=\\pm\\sqrt{q}</span> and <span class="math">a_{2}=q</span>, but also includes ordinary varieties, for example with <span class="math">a_{1}=\\sqrt{q}-1</span> and <span class="math">a_{2}=2q+1</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">If instead (still in the case <span class="math">A=0</span>) <span class="math">B=2C\\neq 0</span>, then <span class="math">(A:B:C:D)=(0:8:4:3)</span>, and we find that (up to a linear change of variables) <span class="math">q(l)=-10l^{2}-5l-2</span>: this cannot represent prime powers, being always negative.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Now, by scaling, we may set A=1. Making the change of variables</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">gives a birational transformation to the curve</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The map is not defined when <span class="math">C=0</span>, so we need to consider this case separately: we find that either <span class="math">(A:B:C:D)=(1:0:0:0)</span> or <span class="math">(A:B:C:D)=(2:2:0:1)</span>. The former gives <span class="math">q(l)</span> linear; the latter gives the family <span class="math">q(l)=5l^{2}</span>, which can only give a prime power if <span class="math">l</span> is a power of <span class="math">5</span>. We get a family, but exponential rather than quadratic.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Any remaining infinite families correspond to rational points on <span class="math">E</span>. Now <span class="math">E</span> has rank <span class="math">1</span>, and a torsion subgroup of order <span class="math">2</span>. A set of generators for the group is</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\{P=(-1,0),Q=(0,1)\\}\\,.</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We can try a few points on this curve, transform back to values for <span class="math">(A:B:C:D)</span>, and see whether we can pick up any new families.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For example, the point <span class="math">(s,t)=(5/8,1/4)</span> gives <span class="math">(A:B:C:D)=(1:4:24:-64)</span>, and this leads to <span class="math">q(l)=1010l^{2}+485l+59</span> or <span class="math">q(l)=1010l^{2}+525l+69</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the first of these possibilities, unfortunately, <span class="math">\\Phi_{5}(q(l))</span> splits as a product of two quartics whose leading coefficients are in the ratio of <span class="math">101^{2}:4^{2}</span>, and we cannot tolerate a fractional cofactor of <span class="math">101/4</span>. In this example, we can patch things up via the transformation <span class="math">l\\mapsto 101l-62</span>, giving a quadratic family (with cofactor <span class="math">h=4</span>)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">q(l)=10303010l^{2}-12600255l+3852429\\,.</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The second possibility, <span class="math">q(l)=1010l^{2}+525l+69</span> is more pleasant, giving us immediately a quadratic family, with cofactor <span class="math">h=404</span>. This is recorded in table 7, along with other families found from small-height points.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-17" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">7.4 k=10</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The case <span class="math">k=10</span> is essentially the same as <span class="math">k=5</span>, via the transformation <span class="math">\\zeta_{5}\\mapsto-\\zeta_{10}</span>. Any <span class="math">q(l)</span> is replaced by <span class="math">-q(l)</span>. So, for example, the useless <span class="math">q(l)=-10l^{2}-5l-2</span> can be replaced by <span class="math">q(l)=10l^{2}+5l+2</span>. This gives a quadratic family with cofactor <span class="math">h=4</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One should not get the impression from these carefully selected examples that all points on the elliptic curve give rise to a family for one of <span class="math">k=5</span> or <span class="math">k=10</span>. As in the case <span class="math">k=12</span> we find that many points on the curve are useless.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Summing up for embedding degrees <span class="math">5</span> and <span class="math">10</span>, we have the following theorem.</p>

    <h6 id="sec-18" class="text-base font-medium mt-4">Theorem 4.</h6>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For <span class="math">k=5</span> and <span class="math">k=10</span> there exist quadratic families of ordinary dimension 2 abelian varieties that have embedding degree <span class="math">k</span>.

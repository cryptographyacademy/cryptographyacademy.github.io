    <h4 id="sec-1" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Abstract</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We present IronDict, a transparent dictionary construction based on polynomial commitment schemes. Transparent dictionaries enable an untrusted server to maintain a mutable dictionary and provably serve clients lookup queries. A major open challenge is supporting efficient auditing by lightweight clients. Previous solutions either incurred high server costs (limiting throughput) or high client lookup verification costs, hindering them from modern messaging key transparency deployments with billions of users. Our construction makes black-box use of a generic multilinear polynomial commitment scheme and inherits its security notions, i.e. binding and zero-knowledge. We implement our construction with the recent KZH scheme and find that a dictionary with 1 billion entries can be verified on a consumer-grade laptop in 35 ms, a 300× improvement over the state of the art, while also achieving 150,000× smaller proofs (8 kB). In addition, our construction ensures perfect privacy with concretely efficient costs for both the client and the server. We also show fast-forwarding techniques based on incremental verifiable computation (IVC) and checkpoints to enable even faster client auditing.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Many essential services, such as financial systems or messaging platforms, are operated by centralized servers with little accountability. Fully decentralized systems often fall short in practice for performance, cost, privacy or other reasons. As a more pragmatic alternative, some traditionally centralized systems have adopted cryptographic transparency to offer increased assurance to the public that they are operating correctly while maintaining their performance benefits. For example, WhatsApp, an encrypted messaging platform with billions of users, rolled out transparency logs for its key-distribution servers in 2024 <a href="#page-42-0">[LL23]</a>. Transparency systems ensure all actions by a central server are publicly visible and enable clients to monitor these actions. For example, in the secure messaging context <a href="#page-44-0">[Ung+15]</a>, a transparency log ensures clients can observe all public keys the server has advertised for their username (though it cannot prevent the server from advertising maliciously chosen keys). Implicitly, transparency systems assume a malicious-but-cautious adversary model <a href="#page-43-0">[Rya14]</a>. That is, making server misbehavior detectable deters misconduct by imposing the risk of reputation damage or legal liability. Transparency has been proposed in a number of contexts, including public-key distribution in encrypted messaging systems <a href="#page-43-0">[Rya14;</a> <a href="#page-42-1">Mel+15;</a> <a href="#page-44-1">Tom15;</a> <a href="#page-38-0">Bon16;</a> <a href="#page-37-0">AlS+17;</a> <a href="#page-38-1">Cha+19;</a> <a href="#page-39-0">Che+22;</a> <a href="#page-41-0">Len+23;</a> <a href="#page-41-1">Len+24]</a>, distribution of software binaries <a href="#page-39-1">[Fah+14;</a> <a href="#page-40-0">HC17;</a> <a href="#page-37-1">AM17;</a> <a href="#page-42-2">Nik+17]</a>, and certificate authorities via the Certificate Transparency (CT) protocol <a href="#page-43-1">[SDS20;</a> <a href="#page-40-1">GPBL20;</a> <a href="#page-41-2">Lei+21;</a> <a href="#page-40-2">KC21;</a> <a href="#page-41-3">KNC22]</a>. All of these applications can utilize a transparent dictionary, a cryptographic data structure that supports verifiable queries over a publicly committed dictionary, i.e. a mapping from a set of labels to a set of values. A transparent dictionary typically involves three logical entities:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>The Server is a centralized service provider that maintains a mutable dictionary and periodically publishes commitments to a public bulletin board. Publication occurs at regular time period or epochs (e.g., once every hour). The server also responds to client and auditor queries.</li>
      <li>Auditors monitor the bulletin board and ensure that the dictionary is well-formed and maintains promised global invariants across epochs.</li>
      <li>Clients issue lookup queries to the server to retrieve values associated with labels of interest (e.g. contacts they wish to message). Clients also monitor their own label and may perform auditing of invariants.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Motivating application: key transparency. An important application of transparent dictionaries is key transparency <a href="#page-42-1">[Mel+15]</a>, in which the server maintains a dictionary, mapping user identities—such as email addresses or usernames—to their public keys. Key transparency promises a practical solution to the age-old challenge of key distribution for encrypted communication systems <a href="#page-44-0">[Ung+15]</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is vital for security that a user can monitor the dictionary at all epochs. Otherwise, while a user is offline, a malicious server could insert a malicious public key (enabling impersonation) and later revert the change to avoid detection. This is known as an oscillation attack <a href="#page-42-3">[Mei+20]</a>. Hence, key transparency systems should support an efficient mechanism to verify that their public key has remained unchanged throughout multiple epochs during which they were offline. Another important goal is privacy <a href="#page-38-1">[Cha+19]</a>. The server's commitments and proofs should reveal nothing about other users (as an update might indicate a lost device) or system-wide details such as the rate of churn. Note that privacy may not be a concern in other applications, such as software transparency, in which all information is considered public. Scale is another vital concern, as popular platforms are now used by billions of users <a href="#page-43-2">[Tec;</a> <a href="#page-39-2">Dat24]</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Constructions based on Merkle trees. Most transparent dictionary constructions are based on Merkle trees <a href="#page-41-4">[Kim+13;</a> <a href="#page-37-2">Bas+14;</a> <a href="#page-41-5">Lau;</a> <a href="#page-42-1">Mel+15;</a> <a href="#page-38-1">Cha+19;</a> <a href="#page-41-1">Len+24;</a> <a href="#page-42-4">Mal+23]</a>. This enables concretely fast operations for both servers and clients, as the only primitive needed is a collision-resistant hash function (typically SHA-256 or SHA-3). However, a major drawback is that auditors' costs scale linearly with the number of updates per epoch, requiring auditors to perform roughly as much computation as the server itself. As a result, client auditing is infeasible in large deployments. Instead, today's deployments rely on third-party auditors such as non-profit watchdog organizations <a href="#page-44-2">[TM24]</a>. At current throughput, auditing WhatsApp's key transparency server requires hashing 200 MB of data every 5 minutes, which is impractical for end users <a href="#page-39-3">[Clo25]</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Constructions from algebraic accumulators. Merkle trees are one construction of a cryptographic accumulator or set commitment. Transparent dictionaries can also be built from other cryptographic accumulators. Bilinear accumulators <a href="#page-44-3">[Tom+19;</a> <a href="#page-41-6">Leu+22]</a>, for example, offer smaller concrete proof sizes for lookups but are generally impractical due to their high storage and computational overhead. For instance, Tomescu et al. <a href="#page-44-3">[Tom+19]</a> report that supporting a dictionary of size 2 &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; would require hundreds of gigabytes of storage. VeRSA <a href="#page-44-4">[Tya+22]</a> proposed transparent dictionaries based on RSA accumulators <a href="#page-38-2">[BBF19;</a> <a href="#page-44-5">TXN20;</a> <a href="#page-44-4">Tya+22]</a>. Like our approach, VeRSA supports efficiently verifying batches of updates. VeRSA offers attractive features: its audit procedure is independent of the epoch size, enabling self-auditing by clients. However, generating lookup proofs with VeRSA is concretely expensive and scales linearly with the dictionary size, limiting its applicability to dictionaries of size in the millions (such as binary transparency scenarios), not billions. Many algebraic accumulators also require a setup (possibly trusted) with large public parameters. This drawback also applies to IronDict when instantiated with KZH, which requires a linear-sized structured reference string. We discuss this further in Sections <a href="#page-9-0">3.1</a> and <a href="#page-29-0">5.4.</a></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Reducing auditing costs. Some works <a href="#page-39-4">[Che+20;</a> <a href="#page-44-6">Tzi+22;</a> <a href="#page-43-3">Ros+24]</a> have attempted to make client-auditing feasible by delegating auditing to an untrusted party—often the server itself—using SNARKs to prove correctness. In practice, the computational cost of generic SNARK-based designs limits throughput. For example, due to the high cost of SHA-256 in zero-knowledge circuits, Hekaton <a href="#page-43-3">[Ros+24]</a> only achieved a throughput of 10 updates per second on a powerful cluster of 4096 nodes. Verdict <a href="#page-44-6">[Tzi+22]</a> took a similar approach but, to reduce circuit size, employed a non-standard ZK-friendly hash function <a href="#page-40-3">[Gra+21]</a>. In contrast, our approach reaches significantly higher throughput using just a single server.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Merkle&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; <a href="#page-40-4">[Hu+21]</a> changes the trust model to improve performance. They reduce the auditor's per-epoch workload to logarithmic in the number of key updates by requiring only a single Merkle extension proof per epoch. However, Merkle&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; relies on the signature chain assumption, that clients maintain a secure key to sign their own key updates, which we consider unrealistic for secure messaging applications as we will discuss in Section <a href="#page-6-0">2.</a></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table of comparison. Figure <a href="#page-4-0">1</a> compares the asymptotic costs of IronDict with prior work. The key advantage of IronDict lies in its audit and update costs, which remain independent of the epoch size. As we will later show in Section <a href="#page-27-0">5,</a> IronDict is concretely efficient since its main operations are field operations, which are concretely efficient.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1.2 Our Contributions</h3>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>A simple transparent dictionary based on polynomial commitments. Our main contribution is IronDict, a novel transparent dictionary built upon a generic polynomial commitment scheme (PCS) defined over a large field<a href="#page-3-0">1</a> , a new paradigm in designing transparent dictionaries. Conceptually, our design is simple, with most of the complexity encapsulated within the underlying PCS scheme. The construction provides (I) low server overhead resulting in a high throughput and (II) low auditing overhead, with the latter being independent of the update batch size. Instantiating IronDict with KZH as the underlying PCS <a href="#page-40-5">[Kad+25]</a> yields a concretely efficient implementation that enables lightweight auditing: audit proofs for a dictionary supporting 1 billion users are under 8 kB and verifiable in about 35 ms on a personal computer, while sustaining a throughput of more than 1,000 updates (or user enrollments) per second.</li>
      <li>Doubly-efficient consistency proofs. We introduce a new approach for verifying consistency in transparent dictionaries; that is, a proof in the common case that an individual label-value mapping was unchanged over many epochs. Unlike prior work, our method eliminates the need to maintain explicit value histories or versioning. We show that consistency can be checked using just two PCS openings (or even a single one if the underlying PCS supports homomorphism), yielding a highly efficient solution for both</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&lt;span id=&quot;page-3-0&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;We require the PCS to be defined over a field F with sufficiently large cardinality—typically |F| ≥ 2 128 or 2 &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;—to ensure that birthday attacks on a hash function H : {0, 1} &lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; → F are computationally infeasible.</p>

Since KZH-k uses precomputed arrays for PCS openings at Boolean points, the server cost is O(1). Update cost includes two terms: N (index assignment via cheap field operations) and b (value updates using group operations). The lookup (and history) cost for the server is  <span class="math">(k^2 + k) \\cdot N^{1/k}</span> , in which a large portion of that can be precomputed by the server since it is independent of the client query.

      <li>Concretely efficient fast-forwarding for auditors via IVC. Fast-forwarding is the ability for a new auditor—or an auditor who has been offline for n epochs—to verify the current state by checking only a sublinear number of proofs, rather than auditing all nepochs individually. We introduce an IVC [Val08] scheme for fast-forwarding auditors for IRONDICT, such that the IVC cost is independent of the size of the update batch. When IRONDICT is concretely instantiated with KZH, we estimate to achieve 1000× prover performance improvement in practice compared to VeRSA Tya+22, which also proposed using an IVC scheme with constant circuit size per step.</li>
      <li>Checkpoints for efficient self-auditing by clients. Inspired by VeRSA, we propose an alternative to IVC that allows clients to fast-forward through updates using lightweight checkpoints. When a client comes online, it only requires verifying a short (sublinearlength) sequence of checkpoint proofs spanning from its last known state to the current</li>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>A stronger definition of privacy. Prior works define privacy in transparent dictionaries by requiring (I) the commitment to the dictionary to be hiding (II) the client queries and audit proofs reveal no more information than what is permitted by a predefined leakage function. These leakage functions are typically tailored to specific constructions and do not offer strong cryptographic guarantees. For example, in SEEMless <a href="#page-38-1">[Cha+19]</a>, lookup queries additionally reveal the last epoch during which a value was updated—a non-standard and unintended leakage arising from their design. In this work, we propose zk-IronDict with a strong, zero-knowledge-based notion of privacy: clients and auditors learn nothing beyond the correctness of their queries and (an upper bound on) the dictionary's size. Our definition is generic and applies to any PCS that satisfies the hiding property and supports zero-knowledge openings <a href="#page-37-3">[B+21</a> ¨ ].</li>
      <li>A zero-knowledge variant of KZH. To meet the privacy requirements, the underlying PCS must have a hiding commitment and a zero-knowledge opening protocol. KZH lacks these properties natively. Prior work <a href="#page-37-3">[B+21</a> ¨ ] proposes a generic compiler that transforms a homomorphic PCS to one that has a zero-knowledge opening protocol. There are two downsides to this approach: (I) it is expensive, and (II) it lacks a formal proof of the zero-knowledge property. In this work, we formally prove the security of this compiler and show that, when applied to KZH, only a sublinear amount of randomness suffices, which makes the compiler lightweight. This contribution can be of independent interest.</li>
      <li>Memory optimizations. By taking advantage of the homomorphic properties of KZH, when IronDict is initiated with KZH, we introduce a trade-off between computation and memory. Specifically, at each epoch, the server only needs to store the difference between the current and previous epoch, reducing the memory overhead. However, when the server needs to open a value later, it incurs a computational cost, performing a number of field operations proportional to the size of the epoch.</li>
      <li>Implementation. We implement IronDict and demonstrate that it scales to dictionaries with billions of entries, matching the demands of modern secure messaging applications, while supporting update rates of up to thousands per second. We conduct our experiments on a Google c4-highmem-144-lssd instance, equipped with 144 CPU cores and 1116 GB of memory. For a dictionary supporting 1 billion users, our system achieves an epoch interval of nearly 15 minutes while sustaining a throughput of over 1000 updates per second. Auditor proofs remain under 8 kB and can be verified in under 35 ms on a consumer-grade laptop. Client queries—including lookups and consistency checks—produce proofs of approximately 6 kB, which can be verified in less than 30 ms.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We outline the basic roles in our system here, which is consistent with prior work on key transparency <a href="#page-42-1">[Mel+15]</a>:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Server. The main entity in our system is a server that provides access to a queryable dictionary (a label-value map) and periodically updates it (once per epoch) while maintaining some invariants. With each update, the server publishes a new commitment to the dictionary. We expect the server to provide verifiable answers to two types of queries:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Lookup: What value is assigned to label ℓ in epoch i?</li>
      <li>Consistency: Has the value assigned to the label ℓ changed between epochs i and j?</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that simply performing lookups on the values mapped to label ℓ at epochs i and j does not suffice as a consistency proof between i and j. The server might attempt an oscillation attack <a href="#page-42-3">[Mei+20]</a> by changing the mapping for a targeted label at one epoch and then switching it back in the next epoch. Hence, a consistency proof must rule out changes in any epoch between i and j. In some systems, the server commits to maintaining additional invariants. For example, a version invariant <a href="#page-42-1">[Mel+15;</a> <a href="#page-38-0">Bon16]</a> attaches a version number v to each value and requires that this is incremented in any epoch in which the value changes. Given this invariant, checking that a value has the same version number in epochs i and j is equivalent to a consistency proof. A stronger invariant ensures that each value is append-only—that is, the dictionary retains all historical versions of a value, so that a lookup at epoch i reveals the entire version history up to that point. Other invariants are application-specific, for example, CONIKs <a href="#page-42-1">[Mel+15]</a> proposed marking some labels as strict, meaning any changes must be authorized by a signature. In our work, we don't adopt any such special invariants and instead build efficient consistency proofs directly.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Client. A set of clients (or users) are able to query the dictionary via the server. Typically, each client is represented by a label ℓ, which is a human-readable identifier such as a username, email address, or phone number.<a href="#page-6-1">2</a> The client will typically monitor this label by requesting consistency proofs between epochs and manually verifying any changes to the value mapped to their label. Clients will also request lookup proofs of other labels of interest, such as peers in a secure messaging system that they wish to communicate with. However, the clients do not monitor other labels over time. The assumption is that the label's owner will monitor and detect any unauthorized changes. There may be restrictions on which labels a user can look up; for example, rate limits or a requirement to be marked as contacts within the system. We leave these out of scope. Clients can also request updates to the value mapped to their label (for example, to change their public key after losing a device). Notably,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&lt;span id=&quot;page-6-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Later, we distinguish between human-readable labels and indices which are assigned to each user but not exposed at the UX level.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">we do not assume any cryptographic authentication (such as a signature) is required to update any mapping, as some prior work does <a href="#page-40-4">[Hu+21]</a>. The downside of such assumptions is that they require users to maintain uninterrupted access to cryptographic keys over time. In practice, users often lose their devices or reinstall applications, thereby losing access to previous secret keys. Recovering from such scenarios inherently requires the server to update any label's value based on non-cryptographic authentication (e.g. passwords or 2FA). This has important implications for monitoring in that surreptitious updates by the server are detectable but not provable. The server can always claim that a legitimate user requested an update, even if they did not. Conversely, any user could falsely accuse the server of making an unauthorized update, even if they approved it. Such disputes must be resolved through non-technical means. If a significant number of reputable users publicly allege that the server is misbehaving, this could serve as compelling, if not conclusive, evidence.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Auditors. Auditors monitor the server's updates and verify the correctness of a proof of invariance at each epoch. At a high level, this proof ensures that the transition from one epoch to the next preserves the desired invariants. For example, under the versioning invariant described previously, a valid transition requires that if a value is modified, its version number must also be incremented accordingly. Importantly, the auditors only check for the server's detectable and provable misbehaviour, such as an incorrect proof of invariance. Some whistle-blowing procedure must be in place to broadcast evidence of misconduct, which we leave out of scope. The efficiency of auditing depends directly on the size and verification cost of invariance proofs. For example, consider the simple case where the server publishes all value updates directly on the bulletin board. In this setting, auditors must be almost as powerful as the server to recompute the updates and verify their correctness. However, the assumption of such powerful auditors means most clients will be incapable of auditing and must rely on a quorum of third parties to audit. While any one correct auditor can broadcast proofs of misbehaviour, the incentives for performing expensive auditing remain unclear. Instead, we aim to make self-auditing possible, where even lightweight clients are capable of performing auditing. As in prior work <a href="#page-44-6">[Tzi+22;</a> <a href="#page-43-3">Ros+24]</a>, we assume the server facilitates this by publishing additional cryptographic proof with each update.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A special case of this is using IVC, in which verifying a proof for any epoch ensures the correctness of all previous updates. This is useful for fast-forwarding, allowing a new auditor, or one who comes online after an extended time, to verify a single proof rather than checking proofs for many missed epochs. We discuss this approach further in Section <a href="#page-32-0">6.</a></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Bulletin board. Like prior work, we assume a public bulletin board, e.g. a publicly accessible and append-only ledger that allows parties to publish arbitrary strings along with authentication tags for verification. We treat the bulletin board as a black box with the following basic functionality: (I) post operation: A party can publish a string on the bulletin board, and (II) retrieve operation: Anyone can query the bulletin board. The use</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">of a bulletin board prevents split-view attacks, where a malicious server provides different clients with inconsistent states of the dictionary at the same epoch i. The bulletin board abstraction can be realised in various ways, e.g. a public blockchain [TD17] or a gossip protocol [Syt+16; Mei+20]. We leave the details out of scope, as they do not affect the design of our dictionary. We denote the public bulletin board via BB.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Notation.</strong> We denote vectors using bold letters, such as  <span class="math">\\mathbf{w}</span> , and use  <span class="math">w_i</span>  to refer to the i-th entry of the vector. Let  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span>  be a finite field and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}</span>  a group with scalars in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span> , with additive notation. For  <span class="math">a \\in \\mathbb{F}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathsf{G} \\in \\mathbb{G}</span> , the scalar multiplication of  <span class="math">\\mathsf{G}</span>  by a is denoted as  <span class="math">a \\times \\mathsf{G}</span> . A function f(x) is negligible if, for any polynomial p(x), there exists a positive integer N such that for all x &gt; N, we have  <span class="math">f(x) &lt; \\frac{1}{p(x)}</span> . When we say an event happens with overwhelming probability, we mean it occurs with a probability of  <span class="math">1 - \\epsilon(\\lambda)</span> , where  <span class="math">\\epsilon(\\lambda)</span>  is a negligible function.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Dictionary.</strong> We denote by a dictionary Dict as a set of label-value pairs  <span class="math">\\{(\\mathsf{label}_i, \\mathsf{value}_i)\\}_{i=1}^m</span>  with <em>unique</em> label values. For a dictionary Dict, we denote by  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Dict}[\\mathsf{label}]</span>  the value corresponding to label in the dictionary  <span class="math">\\mathsf{Dict}</span> ; i.e.,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathsf{Dict}[\\mathsf{label}] := \\begin{cases} \\mathsf{value} &amp; \\text{ if } (\\mathsf{label}, \\mathsf{value}) \\in \\mathsf{Dict} \\\\ \\bot &amp; \\text{ otherwise.} \\end{cases}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">When we refer to a dictionary as Dict :  <span class="math">A \\to B</span> , it means its labels are in set A and its values are in set B.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Multilinear polynomials. A multivariate polynomial is said to be multilinear if the individual degree of any variable  <span class="math">X_i</span>  is at most 1. We use  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{\\mu}^{\\leq 1}[\\mathbf{X}]</span>  to denote the space of all  <span class="math">\\mu</span> -variate multilinear polynomials. A multilinear polynomial  <span class="math">\\overline{p} \\in \\mathbb{F}_{\\mu}^{\\leq 1}[\\mathbf{X}]</span>  of size  <span class="math">N = 2^{\\mu}</span>  is uniquely defined by (or uniquely extends) its N evaluations on the Boolean hypercube. We denote by  <span class="math">\\mathsf{L}_{\\mathbf{w}}(\\mathbf{X})</span>  a multilinear Lagrange polynomial&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; that vanishes all over the Boolean hypercube  <span class="math">\\{0,1\\}^{\\mu}</span>  except on  <span class="math">\\mathbf{w} \\in \\{0,1\\}^{\\mu}</span> . It can be computed as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$L_{\\mathbf{w}}(\\mathbf{X}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{\\mu} (X_i w_i + (1 - X_i)(1 - w_i))</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Multilinear polynomial commitment scheme (PCS). PCS is a cryptographic primitive that enables a prover to <em>commit</em> to a multilinear polynomial succinctly and later prove the correctness of its evaluation at some chosen points from the domain, without revealing</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&lt;span id=&quot;page-8-0&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;&lt;/sup&gt;lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;This polynomial is sometimes called the Eq polynomial, and is used as  <span class="math">L_{\\mathbf{w}}(\\mathbf{X}) = eq(\\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{X})</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">the full polynomial. When a verifier requests an opening at a point  <span class="math">\\vec{x}</span> , the prover returns both the claimed evaluation  <span class="math">y = p(\\vec{x})</span>  and a proof  <span class="math">\\pi</span>  attesting to its correctness. The verifier can efficiently check that y is the correct value of the committed polynomial at  <span class="math">\\vec{x}</span>  using the proof  <span class="math">\\pi</span> . A formal definition of PCS and its required properties is provided in Appendix A.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Sumcheck.</strong> The <em>sumcheck protocol</em> [Lun+92] is an interactive proof between a prover and a verifier for verifying claims of the form</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\sum_{\\mathbf{x}\\in\\{0,1\\}^{\\mu}}p(\\mathbf{x})=s,</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">p(\\mathbf{X}) \\in \\mathbb{F}_{\\mu}^{\\leq d}[\\mathbf{X}]</span> . The protocol reduces this claim to checking the evaluation of p at a randomly chosen point  <span class="math">\\mathbf{r}</span> . It achieves communication complexity  <span class="math">O(\\mu)</span> , prover time O(N) where  <span class="math">N = 2^{\\mu}</span>  which mostly consists of field operations, and verifier time  <span class="math">O(\\mu)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Zerocheck.</strong> A zerocheck [Che+23], similar to sumcheck, is an interactive protocol between a prover and a verifier, wherein the verifier—given oracle access to a multivariate polynomial  <span class="math">p(\\mathbf{X}) \\in \\mathbb{F}^{\\leq d}_{\\mu}[\\mathbf{X}]</span> —checks that p evaluates to zero on all points of the Boolean hypercube. A zerocheck protocol has the same asymptotic complexity as the sumcheck protocol, since the prover and verifier internally invoke a sumcheck on the polynomial  <span class="math">p(\\mathbf{X}) \\cdot \\mathsf{L}_{\\mathbf{r}}(\\mathbf{X})</span> , where  <span class="math">\\mathbf{r}</span>  is a random challenge selected by the verifier.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper, we choose KZH [Kad+25] to instantiate the PCS for our construction. KZH is a family of multilinear PCS built on a pairing-friendly elliptic curve. A key feature of KZH is that it has a sublinear opening proof size and a sublinear opening time for both the prover&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and the verifier, similar to Hyrax [Wah+18]. However, unlike Hyrax and similar to KZG [KZG10], KZH has a commitment of constant size, consisting of a single group element. KZH (more precisely KZH-2) has an opening size and verifier time of  <span class="math">O(N^{\\frac{1}{2}})</span>  and is generalized to a family of schemes called KZH-k for  <span class="math">k \\geq 2</span> , which achieves an opening size and verifier time of  <span class="math">O(k \\cdot N^{\\frac{1}{k}})</span>  for a constant k. A description of KZH-k can be found in Appendix E. A comparison of different variants of KZH can be seen in Table 1. In this paper, when we mention KZH, we refer to the entire KZH-k family. If we are specifically discussing one, we specify it with the index k. KZH is secure in the AGM under the  <span class="math">(q_1, q_2)</span> -dlog and setup-find-rep assumptions.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Advantages of KZH for our scheme. Apart from sublinear proof and verifier time, the KZH family has two key advantages that make it particularly well-suited as the underlying PCS for our construction:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&lt;span id=&quot;page-9-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;&lt;/sup&gt;lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;Excluding the polynomial evaluation itself.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Free opening at Boolean points. Opening Boolean points using KZH-k is essentially free, meaning the server is only required to read k arrays<a href="#page-10-0">5</a> of size N1/k from memory. The term free here refers to the fact that the server does not need to perform any computation to generate the proof; rather, it only needs to read and return the relevant auxiliary data. This is analogous to Merkle trees, where the opening of a leaf involves no computation and consists solely of reading and returning internal nodes. As we will see in the next section, the server only needs to open the polynomial at Boolean points in response to client requests. Therefore, the efficiency of openings at Boolean points—compared to non-Boolean points—is especially important in our setting.</li>
      <li>Homomorphic commitments and auxiliary input. KZH family is homomorphic, and its auxiliary input used for opening is homomorphic as well. Homomorphism here refers that, let (com1, aux1) be a commitment and its corresponding auxiliary input for a polynomial f1, and (com2, aux2) be a commitment and auxiliary input for a polynomial f2. Then, for any scalar α ∈ F, the following pair (α·com1+com2, α·aux1+aux2) is a valid commitment and auxiliary input for the polynomial α · f&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + f2, where · denotes scalar multiplication. This means that updating n evaluation points of a polynomial only requires k · n group operations to update both the commitment and the auxiliary data of KZH-k. Although our scheme does not necessarily require homomorphism, homomorphism significantly improves the efficiency of our protocol for value consistency.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Which variant of KZH to use? The choice of the KZH variant for our scheme depends primarily on the size of the dictionary and the specific application, e.g. constraints by the participants. For example, assume we aim for an opening size that is smaller than 1 MB and can be verified in under one second on a consumer-grade laptop. As a concrete example, consider a multilinear polynomial with hypercube size of N = 231, roughly corresponding to the number of WhatsApp users <a href="#page-39-6">[Fac20]</a>. Using KZH-2 in this setting results in a proof size of approximately 2.6 MB, due to the O(N &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ) scaling. Such a large proof imposes unnecessary client overhead, which can be mitigated, e.g. by using KZH-4 or KZH-8 as the underlying PCS. These variants shift computation to the server and, for a dictionary of size 2 &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;, reduce proof size and verification time by about 100× and 1000×, respectively, at the cost of higher server-side commitment and opening costs (see Table <a href="#page-12-0">1)</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">KZH setup. One limitation of KZH is its requirement for a linear-sized SRS, similar to the trusted setup used in the KZG scheme based on powers-of-tau. The SRS must be generated via a trusted setup, which introduces important security considerations. In practice, such setups are typically carried out using multi-party computation (MPC) ceremonies, where multiple participants sequentially contribute randomness to the SRS. As long as at least</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&lt;span id=&quot;page-10-0&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;These arrays can be implemented as contiguous memory blocks (e.g., flat slices or static arrays), rather than dynamically allocated structures like linked lists or hash maps. This makes memory access highly efficient in practice due to spatial locality and reduced overhead.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">one participant acts honestly, the resulting SRS remains secure. This approach has been successfully employed by real-world systems such as Zcash <a href="#page-38-3">[BGG+16]</a> and Filecoin <a href="#page-42-6">[Pro20]</a>. A summary of current best practices for MPC ceremonies is provided in <a href="#page-44-9">[WCB25]</a>. Concrete numbers of the KZH setup are provided in Section <a href="#page-29-0">5.4.</a></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">While our concrete construction currently relies on KZH, which requires a trusted setup, it is possible to instantiate IronDict with alternative PCSs. For example, one might consider PCSs with transparent setup <a href="#page-44-8">[Wah+18;</a> <a href="#page-38-4">BS+19]</a>, or those with sublinear-sized SRSs <a href="#page-37-3">[B+21</a> ¨ ]. However, such alternatives often come with trade-offs, including increased proof sizes, higher opening times, or higher costs to make them zero-knowledge. Choosing the right PCS is therefore a delicate balance between trust assumptions and efficiency. Identifying suitable alternatives to KZH that offer efficient performance and either a transparent setup or a sublinear trusted setup remains an open direction. We leave this to future work.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Definition 1 (Transparent dictionary). A transparent dictionary protocol is defined with respect to three parties: Server, Auditor, and Client<a href="#page-11-0">6</a> , all of whom have access to a public bulletin board BB. Because of the existence of BB, we assume all parties know the current epoch number i. Each party supports the following algorithms:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Setup(λ, µ) → (keyServer; keyAuditor, keyClient): Given a security parameter λ and log of maximum supported size µ, this algorithm respectively outputs participants' keys, namely: keyServer, keyAuditor and keyClient. We assume algorithms corresponding to each party take their corresponding key as an implicit input; we omit it for brevity. If the setup requires secret randomness, we assume it is executed by a trusted party (e.g., implemented via a ceremony).</li>
      <li>Server.Init() → (state0, com0): Initializes the dictionary state as state&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and computes a succinct commitment com&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to this state. The commitment com&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is then published on the bulletin board BB.</li>
      <li>Server.Update(statei−1, ∆) → (state&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; , com&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; , πi): Updates the current state statei−&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; using a set of changes ∆ to obtain a new state state&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; . It then computes and publishes a new commitment com&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; to BB, along with invariance proof π&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; .</li>
      <li>Server.Lookup(ℓ,statei) → (value, πLookup): Given a label ℓ and epoch state state&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; , returns the value value associated with ℓ in state state&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; , along with a lookup proof πLookup. If state&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; does not exist or ℓ is invalid, the algorithm returns ⊥.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&lt;span id=&quot;page-11-0&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; In practice, there may be many clients and a small number of auditors. For simplicity, we assume a single client and a single auditor.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 1: Comparison of KZH-k variants for k = 2 and k &gt; 2 over a polynomial on a Boolean hypercube of size N. Here, we distinguish between the opening time of a Boolean and a non-Boolean point.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Comparison to <a href="#page-38-1">[Cha+19]</a>. Our definition is an adaptation of <a href="#page-38-1">[Cha+19]</a> with the following minor differences:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>We introduce an additional algorithm, Setup. The Setup algorithm outputs keys for the participating parties. In a tree-based solution, this could be as simple as specifying a hash function. However, since we work in the setting of polynomial commitment schemes, we explicitly include Setup to emphasize that it differs from Server.Init—for example, it may involve secret randomness and thus is not necessarily executed by the server.</li>
      <li>To verify the invariance proof, we assume the verification happens step by step, which is necessary for stateless auditors. In contrast, in <a href="#page-38-1">[Cha+19]</a>, the auditor functionality starts from epoch 0 and verifies to the last epoch.</li>
      <li>We generalize the definition by assuming that the server stores a state state&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; at each step, which may include some data structure enabling the server to store the keys for each epoch. The simplest form would be state&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; = Dict&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; at each epoch.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">• We simplify the history-related functions from previous definitions of TDs by focusing solely on consistency. Whereas earlier formulations returned the entire change history, including all values and their corresponding epochs, our approach replaces this with a single functionality that merely checks whether a value has changed within a given epoch range. This streamlined version is more practical and sufficient for most client applications.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Completeness. Intuitively, completeness guarantees that if the setup is performed honestly and the server behaves honestly, then the following holds:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Consistency correctness: When the client requests a value consistency check between epochs i to j such that the value has not changed, running Client.VerConsistency on the proof leads to acceptance. When the client queries a value at any time within the epoch interval [i, j), the returned value is the same.</li>
      <li>Audit correctness: At each epoch, any honest auditor running Auditor.VerifyInvariance obtains output 1.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Soundness. Except with negligible probability, the following properties hold:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Lookup soundness (binding): Given a commitment com&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; to an epoch and a single label ℓ, it is computationally infeasible for the server to produce two distinct values, each accompanied by a valid proof, such that both pass verification under Client.VerifyLookup for the same commitment.</li>
      <li>Consistency soundness: Assume at each epoch there is at least one honest auditor that accepts the epoch proof. For any two epochs i and j, if the value changes during the interval [i, j], then the server cannot generate a proof of the consistency of the value that will be accepted by the client.</li>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we describe our construction, which is based on a generic PCS. In Section <a href="#page-14-0">4.1,</a> we introduce how a restricted class of dictionaries can be modeled using a single multilinear polynomial, and we explain why this approach fails for general string-to-string dictionaries. In Section <a href="#page-15-0">4.2,</a> we extend the previous idea and show how to construct general dictionaries—mapping arbitrary strings to arbitrary strings—using two multilinear polynomials, referred to as Index and Value polynomials. We also specify the required properties of each polynomial. Section <a href="#page-16-0">4.3</a> focuses on Index polynomial and its append-only property, discussing associated design trade-offs. Then, in Section <a href="#page-19-0">4.4,</a> we present how Value polynomial is</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">used to support value consistency proofs. Finally, in Section <a href="#page-22-1">4.5,</a> we describe the complete construction using a generic PCS. In Section <a href="#page-22-0">4.6,</a> we describe our notion of privacy and introduce our privacy-preserving variant zk-IronDict. Finally, we provide a cost overview of the construction instantiated with the KZH family. This includes the additional costs incurred to make the scheme privacy-preserving—that is, to transform KZH zero-knowledge.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Modeling a restricted class of dictionaries. Given two natural numbers m and N, such that we assume N is a power of two, consider a dictionary represented as a set of pairs of labels index&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; and values value&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; :</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\left\\{ (\\mathsf{index}_i, \\mathsf{value}_i) \\right\\}_{i \\in [m]} : \\begin{cases} \\mathsf{index}_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}^{\\log_2 N} \\\\ \\mathsf{value}_i \\in \\mathbb{F} \\setminus \\{0\\} \\end{cases}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We model this dictionary as a multilinear polynomial p ∈ F ≤1 log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; N , where p(indexi) = value&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; for each stored index-value pair, and p(x) = 0 for all indices x that do not appear in the dictionary, in other words:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\overline{p}(\\mathbf{X}) = \\begin{cases} \\mathsf{value}_i &amp;: \\mathbf{X} = \\mathsf{index}_i \\\\ 0 &amp;: \\mathbf{X} \\in \\{0,1\\}^{\\log_2 N} \\setminus \\{\\mathsf{index}_i\\}_{i \\in [m]} \\end{cases}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We are implicitly using the fact that given multilinear polynomial evaluations over the Boolean hypercube, it determines a single unique polynomial.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One-to-one mapping from {0, 1} ∗ to F. The dictionary described above represents a restricted type: it maps non-zero elements from a finite field F to binary strings of fixed length {0, 1} log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; . In contrast, we are interested in a more general setting of dictionaries that map arbitrary strings to arbitrary strings. To handle such general dictionaries, we adopt the common approach of hashing arbitrary strings into a fixed domain. Consider a collision-resistant hash function H : {0, 1} &lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; → F. We can treat H as a one-to-one mapping from {0, 1} ∗ to F \\ {0}, as (1) collision resistance implies it's infeasible to find two distinct inputs with the same output, and (2) oneway-ness (implied by collision resistance) implies it is hard to find an input that maps to 0.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Modeling general dictionaries (strawman approach). As explained above, in practice, transparent dictionaries often operate over domains and ranges in {0, 1} ∗ , or equivalently in F or F \\ {0}, as discussed earlier. A naive approach to modeling such dictionaries is to hash a user label (e.g., an email address) to a point x ∈ {0, 1} log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; on the Boolean hypercube and assign the corresponding value to p(x). However, for the construction to be both correct and sound, different labels must be mapped to distinct points on the hypercube. A naive</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">use of a hash function does not ensure this uniqueness. To minimize collisions, the target space {0, 1} log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; must be exponentially large; typically larger than 2 &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;, to ensure collision resistance. Otherwise, collisions become feasible. Supporting such an enormous domain would require operating on a sparse polynomial of size 2 &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;. This would be infeasible with current polynomial commitments, including KZH or Hyrax, since even a square-root-sized SRS is too large to be materialised. Using sparse to dense techniques such as Spark <a href="#page-43-6">[Set20]</a>, while feasible, suffers from inefficient openings since the opening requires an argument of knowledge, making them unsuitable for our needs. Given these limitations, we adopt a different strategy: modeling the general dictionary using two dense polynomials instead of a single sparse one.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Modeling dictionaries. To model a dictionary with domain Dict : {0, 1} &lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; → {0, 1} ∗ , we build it by composing two different dictionaries Index and Value as described:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathsf{Index}: \\mathbb{F} \\setminus \\{0\\} \\to \\{0,1\\}^{\\log_2 N}, \\, \\mathsf{Value}: \\{0,1\\}^{\\log_2 N} \\to \\mathbb{F} \\setminus \\{0\\}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">which, by composability, implies that:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathsf{Dict} = (\\mathsf{Index}, \\mathsf{Value}) : \\mathbb{F} \\setminus \\{0\\} \\to \\mathbb{F} \\setminus \\{0\\}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To retrieve the value associated with label from Dict = (Index, Value), the user first looks up the corresponding index in Index, then uses this index to query Value. Assume a user wants to obtain value υ, corresponding to label ℓ. The procedure is intuitively described in Figure <a href="#page-16-1">2.</a> Here is a quick overview of the Index and Value dictionaries (polynomials). We'll explore them in depth in the next subsections.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Index dictionary. An append-only dictionary, denoted as Index : F \\ {0} → {0, 1} log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; , we exclusively use it for assigning a fixed point on the Boolean hypercube to a label. This dictionary maps labels (e.g., email addresses) to a unique index within {0, 1} log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; , where N represents the system's capacity, i.e., the maximum number of values it can support. The index corresponding to a label is sometimes referred to in prior work, e.g. <a href="#page-41-1">[Len+24]</a> as a Uniquely Universal Identifier (UUID)—an internal, immutable representation of the label. In our system, this index corresponds to a point on the Boolean hypercube, which determines the evaluation point of the associated label. When adding a new label, the server must assign the label a fresh index. The server does so by applying open addressing <a href="#page-45-0">[Wik25]</a>. Note that the uniqueness of indexes implies that their inverse dictionary is also a dictionary.<a href="#page-15-1">7</a></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&lt;span id=&quot;page-15-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; In fact, we model its inverse, Index&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; : {0, 1} log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; → F \\ {0}, using a multilinear polynomial. However, since the dictionary is invertible, this distinction does not matter.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 1. Open addressing is a collision resolution technique used in hash tables to handle situations where two keys hash to the same index. Instead of using separate data structures (like linked lists), open addressing stores all entries directly in the table itself. When a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for the next available slot using a defined probing sequence. This means that each label-value pair is stored at a unique index, and the table is probed until an empty slot is found.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Value dictionary. A dictionary Value : {0, 1} log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; → F \\ {0} that maps user indices to their values. Unlike Index, which is append-only and maintains user indices, this dictionary allows updates to values. Maintaining two separate dictionaries allows the system to accommodate different update rates in practice since their updating procedure is different, as we will see—for instance, values might be updated more frequently than new users are registered (assigned new indexes). We construct a transparent dictionary Dict with a pair of multilinear polynomials encoding the dictionaries Index and Value separately; namely index and value. We refer to the indexed version of these polynomials, (index&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; , valuei), as the state of the dictionary at epoch i. The server uses a PCS to commit to these polynomials and publish the commitments on the bulletin board BB.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>&lt;span id=&quot;page-16-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(1) Server returns an index (some point y ∈ {0, 1} log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; on the boolean hypercube) along with a proof πindex, which proves that indexi(y) = H(ℓ) and y is the unique index corresponding to ℓ. In the next subsection, we explain the details of πindex.</li>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As previously mentioned, the server must prove the correctness of the index dictionary at every step to prevent attacks that exploit inconsistent indexing. For each user, the client must accept a single, unique index on the Boolean hypercube {0, 1} log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; . If the server provides multiple indexes corresponding to the same label ℓ, a split-view attack can occur. Specifically, consider the case where the server assigns two different indexes y1, y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ∈ {0, 1} log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; to the same label ℓ. If these indexes produce different evaluations under the value function, i.e., value(y1) ̸= value(y2), then the server can take advantage of this mapping to present different values to different clients. Ensuring correctness means proving that each label is consistently assigned to a single index in all interactions. To assign indices to other labels, we employ an open addressing strategy inspired by sparse Merkle trees <a href="#page-39-7">[DPP16]</a>. In addition to the hash function H : {0, 1} &lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; → F, we also introduce another hash function H : {0, 1} &lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; → {0, 1} log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; . The server assigns an index to a label ℓ using the algorithm described in Figure <a href="#page-17-0">3.</a> The server is only allowed to assign one of the indexes H(0, ℓ), H(1, ℓ), . . . to the user in sequential order. Any deviation from this order renders the index invalid. Now, suppose that the server assigns H(m0, ℓ) to the user. When the server opens the index to the client, it must also prove that all previous indexes H(m, ℓ) for m &lt; m&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; were occupied and are not equal to H(ℓ). Note that the server might arbitrarily set index(y) = H(ℓ) for some point y. However, since the client requires an identifier m&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ∈ N such that y = H(m0, ℓ), it would not affect the client. The verification procedure is described in Figure <a href="#page-17-1">4.</a></p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>&lt;span id=&quot;page-17-0&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(1) Set m := 0, now given label ℓ, the server computes y := H(m, ℓ) and checks if the index y is not already assigned, in other words, index(y) = 0. If so, it sets index(y) = H(ℓ) and returns y as the assigned index.</li>
      <li>(2) If index(y) ̸= 0, the server updates m := m + 1 and then recompute y := H(m, ℓ) and repeats the procedure. This continues until an unassigned index is found.</li>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Epoch consistency proof. We require Index dictionary to be append-only, meaning that all indexes in the previous state must be included in the current state. Assume index&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; and indexi+1 are the states of the index dictionary in epochs i and i + 1. The server must prove that: index&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; ⊆ indexi+1, which means that the new dictionary Indexi+1 includes all the previous indexes from Index&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; . This condition is expressed as, for all x ∈ {0, 1} log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; :</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$Z(\\mathbf{x}) := \\overline{\\operatorname{index}}_i(\\mathbf{x}) \\cdot \\left(\\overline{\\operatorname{index}}_{i+1}(\\mathbf{x}) - \\overline{\\operatorname{index}}_i(\\mathbf{x})\\right) = 0 \\implies \\sum_{\\mathbf{w} \\in \\{0,1\\}^{\\log_2 N}} \\mathsf{L}_{\\mathbf{w}}(\\mathbf{X}) \\cdot Z(\\mathbf{w}) = 0</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The condition above corresponds to a zerocheck <a href="#page-39-5">[Che+23]</a>. At a high level, it requires the server to publish a sumcheck proof along with openings of the polynomials index&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; and indexi+1 at a random challenge point r. Crucially, since both polynomials are opened at the same point, a homomorphic PCS enables these openings to be batched into a single one by verifying a random linear combination of the two commitments, thereby reducing the verification cost and the communication on the bulletin board. Since the sumcheck proof is relatively inexpensive in practice, the auditor's cost is primarily dominated by the PCS verification(s), e.g. a multi-pairing of size  <span class="math">k \\cdot N^{1/k}</span>  when using KZH-k, where N denotes the size of the dictionary. Our index dictionary can be thought of as an append-only zero-knowledge set (aZKS) as described in [Cha+19].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Overhead of index proof. One potential issue with this approach arises when the identifier  <span class="math">m_0</span>  is large. In such cases, the server must open  <span class="math">m_0</span>  points on index&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, increasing both communication and computation for the server and client. To address this, we overprovision the dictionary capacity. This over-provisioning is necessary because labels are mapped to indexes using a random mapping, e.g. a hash function. As the number of labels approaches the dictionary's capacity N, the probability of hash collisions increases. By setting the nominal capacity to a higher number than the expected number of labels, we significantly reduce the likelihood of such collisions, ensuring that the mapping remains efficient. Specifically, if we expect N users, we set the capacity to be  <span class="math">\\alpha \\times N</span>  for  <span class="math">2 \\le \\alpha</span> . This setup ensures that a fraction  <span class="math">\\frac{\\alpha-1}{\\alpha}</span>  of the dictionary remains deliberately unoccupied. Given that the hash function behaves like a random oracle, the probability that a new label  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  maps to an unassigned index  <span class="math">\\mathcal{H}(0,\\ell)</span>  is exactly  <span class="math">\\frac{\\alpha-1}{\\alpha}</span> . Consequently, the likelihood that an identifier takes the value  <span class="math">m_0</span>  is given by:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\Pr[\\text{identifier} = m_0] = \\frac{\\alpha - 1}{\\alpha^{m_0}} \\implies</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathbb{E}[\\text{Number of openings}] = \\sum_{m_0 = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\alpha - 1}{\\alpha^{m_0}} \\cdot m_0 = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha - 1}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For instance, setting  <span class="math">\\alpha=4</span>  results in the expected number of openings to be  <span class="math">\\approx 1.33</span> . This indicates that, on average, the server must open approximately 1.33 proofs, rather than just one. Setting  <span class="math">\\alpha=4</span>  increases the SRS size by a factor of 4 and the verifier's cost by  <span class="math">2\\times</span> . While it increases the prover's cost for opening the polynomial at random points, it does not impact the polynomial evaluation time, since evaluations at zero points do not contribute to the computation. Interestingly, when we instantiate IRONDICT with KZH, the number of group operations does not increase. This is because committing to zeros is essentially free in Pedersen-like commitment schemes.</p>

Similar to most prior works [Mel+15; Cha+19; Len+24], we employ an asymmetric, keyed Verifiable Random Function (VRF) [MRV99] instead of a simple hash function  <span class="math">\\mathcal{H}</span>  to assign indices to users. This choice enhances both security and privacy because the output of a hash function is deterministic and publicly computable, allowing adversaries to precompute hashes offline and potentially link dictionary entries to known labels—enabling various attacks [Mel+15]. Specifically, if  <span class="math">\\mathcal{H}</span>  were directly evaluable by an adversary, they could craft labels that produce large identifiers  <span class="math">m_0</span> , increasing the computational burden of the server. In contrast, the output of a VRF cannot be computed</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">by clients themselves, effectively preventing brute-force attempts. As a result, we can assume that the output of H is uniformly random and has not been precomputed by the adversary. This allows our worst-case analysis to align closely with the average-case scenario.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Comparison to cuckoo hashing. A related strategy to open addressing for handling collisions in a hash table is cuckoo hashing <a href="#page-42-8">[PR04;</a> <a href="#page-40-6">FKP23]</a>. In open addressing, when a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for the next available slot (using linear, quadratic, or double hashing), but already-inserted elements remain untouched. In contrast, cuckoo hashing uses multiple hash functions and allows each key to occupy one of several candidate positions. When a collision occurs, the new key displaces the existing key, which must then be reinserted into the table, potentially triggering a chain of displacements. This key feature of displacing previously assigned elements makes cuckoo hashing more dynamic but can also lead to more complex insertions, including occasional full rehashing. While cuckoo hashing can more efficiently utilize available slots, open addressing is a more natural fit for our purposes as previously inserted elements are never displaced. This lets us take advantage of the append-only property, which can be naturally and simply expressed using polynomial equations. We leave an investigation of cuckoo hashing-based index polynomial to future work.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-4" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">&lt;span id=&quot;page-19-0&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;4.4 Value consistency</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">An important feature of a transparent dictionary is value consistency, a resource-constrained client should be able to succinctly verify that its value has not changed over a specific period. This translates to checking whether the value corresponding to a specific label has remained unchanged from epoch i to epoch j. A naive approach would involve opening all commitments value&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; , valuei+1, . . ., value&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt; , at the index corresponding to the client and verifying that the value has not changed. However, this would be inefficient for both the client and the server since on each consistency check, the server computation, the client computation and the communication complexity are linear in the number of epochs. Our solution leverages randomness and is concretely more efficient when using a homomorphic PCS; we refer to this approach as RLC (random linear combination) based approach. In the RLC-based approach, when the PCS is homomorphic such as KZH, the server performs O(n) group operations per epoch, where n is the number of updated entries. This yields constant-sized communication on BB and constant auditor verification time. The server simply publishes a few PCS commitments on BB, and the auditor checks a homomorphic relation between them, i.e. equation <a href="#page-21-0">(1)</a>. However, if the PCS is not homomorphic, nonhomomorphically evaluating the same check requires four polynomial openings—due to the four distinct polynomials in equation <a href="#page-21-0">(1)</a>—and publishing their openings at a random point on BB.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&lt;span id=&quot;page-19-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Remark 2. In our approach, retrieving the full value history requires work linear in the number of value changes. However, most clients are primarily interested in value consistency: verifying that their value has remained unchanged over a given period. In this common use case, both the server's and verifier's proofs are independent of the number of value changes or the number of intermediate epochs.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">RLC-based approach. We define the difference polynomial ∆i(X), which is essentially the polynomial corresponding to the update at epoch i, as below:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\overline{\\Delta_i}(\\mathbf{X}) = \\overline{\\text{value}}_i(\\mathbf{X}) - \\overline{\\text{value}}_{i-1}(\\mathbf{X})</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\implies \\overline{\\text{value}}_j(\\mathbf{X}) = \\overline{\\text{value}}_i(\\mathbf{X}) + \\sum_{t=i+1}^j \\overline{\\Delta_t}(\\mathbf{X})</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The naive approach to verifying whether a value remains unchanged between two epochs i and j is to simply open the value at both epochs and compare the values for equality. However, this method is vulnerable to a ghost-value attack, in which the server temporarily modifies the value during some intermediate epoch and later reverts it to its original value. To prevent such attacks, we introduce randomness in a way that ensures changes to a value–even if reverted–cannot cancel each other out. Strawman fix would be for the client to send randomness ri+1, rr+2, . . . , r&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt; to the server, server computes</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\overline{\\text{rand}}(\\mathbf{X}) = \\overline{\\text{value}}_i(\\mathbf{X}) + \\sum_{t=i+1}^j r_t \\cdot \\overline{\\Delta_t}(\\mathbf{X}),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and client given commitments to valuei(x) and the random coefficients can compute commitment to polynomial rand(X) through homomorphism. Now that the value hasn't changed in the epochs i to j with an overwhelming probability, we have rand(X) and valuei(X) open to the same value at the index corresponding to the user. Client checks that by requesting the server to open both commitments at the user index and verifying their equality. However, the above solution is too costly both for the server and the client. Each consistency check requires both the server and the client to perform linear computation and communication in the number of epochs. Another issue arises because the client sends the randomness directly to the server. The server must recompute all relevant operations using the new random value for each client request, leading to significant computational overhead. We address all of these inefficiencies by applying the Fiat-Shamir transform <a href="#page-40-7">[FS87]</a>, replacing interactive randomness exchange with a non-interactive mechanism, e.g. derive the randomness by hashing the current state of the BB. Consider the following polynomial, which is recursively defined as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\overline{\\mathrm{rand}}_i(\\mathbf{X}) = \\overline{\\mathrm{value}}_0(\\mathbf{X}) + \\sum_{t=1}^i r_t \\cdot \\overline{\\Delta_t}(\\mathbf{X}) = \\overline{\\mathrm{rand}}_{i-1}(\\mathbf{X}) + r_i \\cdot \\overline{\\Delta_i}(\\mathbf{X})</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">At each epoch, the server publishes a commitment to randi(X), where correctness can be verified by auditors using the homomorphism through the equation</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&lt;span id=&quot;page-21-0&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
<span class="math">$\\overline{\\operatorname{rand}}_{i}(\\mathbf{X}) = \\overline{\\operatorname{rand}}_{i-1}(\\mathbf{X}) + r_{i} \\cdot \\overline{\\Delta_{i}}(\\mathbf{X})</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$= \\overline{\\operatorname{rand}}_{i-1}(\\mathbf{X}) + r_{i} \\cdot \\left(\\overline{\\operatorname{value}}_{i}(\\mathbf{X}) - \\overline{\\operatorname{value}}_{i-1}(\\mathbf{X})\\right)</span>$
(1)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It requires the auditors to ensure that randomness r&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; is derived correctly through the Fiat-Shamir transformation. To verify the consistency of a value at index x from epoch i to epoch j, the client simply queries the openings of randi(X) and rand&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt; (X) at x. If randi(x) = rand&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt; (x), then with overwhelming probability, the value at index x has remained unchanged between epochs i and j. On the client side, the computational complexity of the consistency check amounts to two PCS verifications—independent of the number of epochs—which can be further reduced to a single opening if the underlying PCS supports homomorphism. On the server side, only two PCS openings at a Boolean point are required. Finally, the auditor's task is limited to verifying a single homomorphic relation and checking that the randomness r&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; is correctly derived.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Adapting the approach to non-homomorphic PCS. While the homomorphic relation can be directly verified using homomorphic PCS, it is also possible to check such equalities non-homomorphically by evaluating both sides at a random point. Specifically, auditors verify equation <a href="#page-21-0">(1)</a> as follows: Given commitments to randi−1(X), randi(X), valuei−1(X), and valuei(X), this equality can be verified non-homomorphically by evaluating all polynomials at a random point r and checking:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\overline{\\mathrm{rand}}_i(\\mathbf{r}) = \\overline{\\mathrm{rand}}_{i-1}(\\mathbf{r}) + r_i \\cdot \\left(\\overline{\\mathrm{value}}_i(\\mathbf{r}) - \\overline{\\mathrm{value}}_{i-1}(\\mathbf{r})\\right).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Such a random evaluation point r can be derived via a hash of the commitments. This method requires the server to publish four PCS openings at the point r on BB, which the auditors must verify.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Equivalence of value consistency and value history. We note that value consistency and value history, a concept primarily used in tree-based approaches, refer to the same underlying idea. However, since value consistency aligns more closely with user interests, we adopt it in our setting. To see the equivalence, consider that given the value history {(n&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; , υi)}i∈[m] , where n&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the epoch at which the value changes to υ&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; , it is straightforward to verify whether the value remained unchanged between any two epochs. Conversely, if a value has changed at epochs n1, . . . , nm, the server can prove the full value history by showing that the value did not change within each interval [n&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; , ni+1) and by revealing the value at each epoch n&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; . This requires a linear number of lookups and consistency checks proportional to the number of value changes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The goal of a privacy-preserving transparent dictionary <a href="#page-42-1">[Mel+15;</a> <a href="#page-38-1">Cha+19]</a> is to ensure that commitments to the dictionary reveal no information about its underlying contents and that proofs provided by the server disclose only what is strictly necessary. This aligns with the notion of metadata privacy, as distinguished in prior work <a href="#page-39-0">[Che+22]</a>, which identifies two categories of privacy: (1) content privacy and (2) metadata privacy. Content privacy refers to access control policies enforced by the server—for instance, allowing users to retrieve only the public keys of their contacts, thereby mitigating spam (when the transparent dictionary is used as a PKI). These policies are external to the design of the transparent dictionary. In contrast, metadata privacy, which is the focus of a privacy-preserving transparent dictionary, aims to prevent leakage of information by the server, for example, as a result of publishing commitments on the bulletin board. Privacy is essential in settings such as secure messaging. If the server leaked patterns of value updates, a malicious party could infer which users frequently rotate their keys and which do not, potentially identifying less cautious users or rarely used devices. In another case, if an attacker compromises a device's value and observes that it remains unchanged in the next epoch, they can conclude that the device owner is unaware of the breach.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Privacy in previous work. CONIKs <a href="#page-42-1">[Mel+15]</a> described a notation of privacy which was later formalized by SEEMless <a href="#page-38-1">[Cha+19]</a> that defined privacy through a formal leakage function, ensuring that the information published by the server, namely, commitments posted on the bulletin board and accompanying proofs, reveals no more than what the leakage function allows. For instance, in SEEMless, the leakage function for value queries unnecessarily reveals the value's version number and the epoch of its last update. A further</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">limitation of defining privacy through a leakage function is its fragility: the leakage must be carefully specified, and even minor changes to the system can alter it, requiring new proofs.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">zk-IronDict's notion of privacy. IronDict is generically built on a PCS. The server reveals three main components: PCS commitments, PCS openings, and sumcheck proofs. Suppose the underlying PCS provides hiding commitments and zero-knowledge openings <a href="#page-37-3">[B+21</a> ¨ ], and the sumcheck protocol is also zero-knowledge. In that case, each piece of published information proves only what is intended–nothing more. Specifically, hiding commitments protect the contents of the committed dictionary with no leakage, while zero-knowledge openings and sumcheck proofs ensure that the verifier learns only the claimed evaluation results and nothing beyond. There are general compilers <a href="#page-38-5">[CFS17;</a> <a href="#page-38-4">BS+19]</a> that can make sumcheck protocols zero-knowledge with minimal overhead. Our construction is concretely based on KZH, which by default does not support hiding. One could apply generic compilers designed to make homomorphic commitments hiding <a href="#page-37-3">[B+21</a> ¨ ], but they involve generating and committing to randomness linear in the size of the polynomial. In Appendix <a href="#page-52-0">D,</a> we present a zero-knowledge variant of KZH, which may be of independent interest. This construction requires only k 2 · N1/k + k · N1/k random scalars per opening on the server side. Specifically, k 2 · N1/k scalars are needed to construct random polynomial r with k·N1/k non-zero values together with its auxiliary inputs. Since there are k−1 auxiliary inputs, and each requires k · N1/k scalar multiplications, the total cost amounts to k 2 · N1/k for generating the polynomial commitment along with its auxiliary inputs. Importantly, this cost is independent of the opening point and can therefore be precomputed by the server. The remaining term, k · N1/k, corresponds to taking a random linear combination of the random polynomial with another polynomial and computing its opening at the client's desired point; this cost arises in the online phase. When applying zk-KZH, homomorphic relations over blinded commitments cannot be verified directly as in the unblinded case. Instead, they require an additional sigma protocol, which introduces only a small overhead for both the server and auditors wishing to verify such relations. We describe this procedure in more detail in Appendix <a href="#page-56-1">D.3.</a></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Size leakage. Our privacy definition ensures that all public information posted by the server—such as commitments, sumcheck proofs, etc.—is zero-knowledge and reveals nothing beyond what it is intended to convey. Similarly, client queries (e.g., lookups and consistency proofs) reveal only the requested value in the dictionary. However, our construction leaks information about the size of the dictionary. In particular, the SRS inherently reveals an upper bound on the number of users, and the frequency of collisions in open-addressing leaks information about the current number of users. An adversary seeking information on the number of users could conduct probing attacks, registering multiple labels and, based on their identifiers (e.g., the number of hashes required to find an empty slot), infer statistical information on the current number of users. We leave analysis of such attacks to</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">future work, noting that they do not contradict our zero-knowledge-based privacy definition. Furthermore, similar size information is leaked by Merkle-tree-based implementations. We consider it out of scope of our privacy definition.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 8: Summary of IRONDICT costs when using the KZH-k scheme: Here N is the maximum capacity of the dictionary (including the a constant over-provisioning factor) and n is the number of updates in the epoch.  <span class="math">\\mathbb G</span>  denotes a group scalar multiplication,  <span class="math">\\mathbb F</span>  a field operation,  <span class="math">\\mathbb H</span>  a hash function, and  <span class="math">\\mathbb P</span>  a pairing.  <span class="math">\\mathrm{VRF}_{\\mathcal P}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathrm{VRF}_{\\mathcal V}</span>  denote  <span class="math">\\mathrm{VRF}</span>  proof generation and verification, i.e. we assume the server uses a verifiable pseudorandom function instead of the hash function  <span class="math">\\mathcal H</span>  to assign indexes. Parameter k is the KZH-k variant. Red-highlighted costs apply only for k&gt;2, as KZH-2 avoids group operations for opening random points. PCS verification also includes an MSM, but its cost is omitted as negligible compared to pairings. Blue-highlighted costs apply for the privacy-preserving variant zk-IronDict as described in Section 4.6.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Remark 3.</strong> The proof of invariance or correctness—namely the zerocheck proof—does not necessarily need to be published on the bulletin board (BB), as long as the corresponding polynomial commitments are made public. Instead, these proofs can be communicated directly between the server and auditors upon request. For this reason, we state that the communication cost on BB is O(1) for both index assignment and value updates, since we assume only the new polynomial commitments are posted on BB.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We implement and benchmark zk-IRONDICT in 4000 lines of Rust code&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;. Our implementation is built atop the arkworks [con22] framework, and also uses the Hyperplonk [Che+23]&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; repository for the multivariate zerocheck and sumcheck implementations. For our PCS instantiation, we implement KZH-k [Kad+25] from scratch, with a tunable parameter k, in additional 2500 lines of Rust code, inspired by the original KZH implementation 10. In our experiments, we set  <span class="math">k = (\\log N)/2</span>  where N is the polynomial size. All server measurements are performed on a Google c4-highmen-144-lssd instance with 144 CPU cores and 1116 GB of memory. Client and auditor measurements are performed single-threaded on a MacBook Pro with 18 GB of RAM and a 12-core Apple M3 Pro CPU. We use the curve Bn254 for all our measurements, which is a standard pairing-friendly curve used in industry [But14]. We employ a Schnorr signature-based VRF [Sch90] in place of a hash function mapping arbitrary strings to points on the Boolean hypercube. All measurements are done over two dictionary sizes: (a) a small dictionary with  <span class="math">2^{24}</span>  (over 10 million) entries&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; for light-weight use cases such as software distribution (b) a large dictionary with  <span class="math">2^{30}</span>  (over 1 billion) entries for large-scale use cases such as messaging applications. Also, we report the numbers with an overprovisioning factor of  <span class="math">\\alpha = 4</span> ; meaning that the reported capacity utilizes  <span class="math">\\frac{1}{4}</span>  of the implemented data structure, e.g. the polynomial underlying the dictionary of size  <span class="math">2^{30}</span>  is of size  <span class="math">2^{32}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 4. All reported numbers in this section, for both small and large dictionaries, correspond to zk-IronDict. While privacy is unnecessary for applications such as software distribution, we present the privacy-preserving results to illustrate how performance scales from 10 million to 1 billion entries. The main impact of adding privacy to IronDict is on server lookup and consistency proofs—for example, using IronDict instead of zk-IronDict with the small dictionary reduces server time for lookups and consistency proofs from 10ms to under 1ms, yielding a 10× improvement.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-6" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">&lt;span id=&quot;page-27-5&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;5.1 Server costs</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We benchmark four important server operations: Index assignment, value update, lookups and consistency proofs. Also, we measure the size of the server key, which persistently resides in memory.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Index assignment time.</strong> We evaluate the time and communication cost (message size) incurred by the server when posting to the bulletin board to register a batch of new indices.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&lt;sup&gt;&amp;&lt;/sup&gt;lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;The number of apps on Google Play, Apple App Store, and the number of Linux packages are all below 5 million [Repnd; 42m25].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We are primarily interested in the operational range under 1000 updates per second &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;, and we mark this threshold in Figure 9. Within this range, the index assignment time is dominated by the time required to run a sumcheck prover on a polynomial of the dictionary size, which scales linearly with the dictionary size. After a certain point—outside the operational region—the cost of PCS opening begins to affect the overall registration cost which we can ignore. Figure 9 shows that for the small dictionary, the index assignment time is at around 10 seconds, while for the large dictionary, it is around 15 minutes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Value dictionary update. Unlike the index dictionary, where update costs scale with the full dictionary size, updates to the value dictionary depend only on the batch size. The update time mainly reflects the cost of committing to a highly sparse update polynomial, which requires an MSM proportional to the batch size. As shown in Figure 9, for batches of hundreds to thousands, updates take around 2 seconds for the small dictionary and around 2 minutes for the large dictionary. The corresponding bulletin board message remains a small constant as well, under 1 kB per batch.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lookups and consistency.</strong> Both lookup and consistency queries involve opening two polynomials at a point on the Boolean hypercube:  <span class="math">\\overline{\\text{value}}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\overline{\\text{index}}</span>  for lookups, and  <span class="math">\\overline{\\text{rand}}_i</span>  and  <span class="math">\\overline{\\text{rand}}_j</span>  for consistency. As a result, their server costs are nearly the same. Section 5.1 shows that for the small dictionary, the server time is around 15 milliseconds, while for the large dictionary it doubles to 30 milliseconds.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We evaluate the cost of two types of client-side queries, namely: lookup and value consistency. As mentioned in Section <a href="#page-27-5">5.1,</a> these operations have similar costs. In both cases, the cost is dominated by two PCS verifications. This results in nearly identical performance for both query types. Figure <a href="#page-29-1">10</a> illustrates that for both small and large dictionaries, the lookup verification time is under 30ms. Also, the client key size is less than 1 MB. The communication cost for the lookup query, as illustrated in Figure <a href="#page-29-1">10</a> remains under 5 kB.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-7" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">5.3 Auditor costs</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The auditor cost is dominated by the time taken to verify a PCS opening at a random point. There is also a logarithmic field operation cost for verifying the sumcheck proof, which is negligible compared to the PCS opening time. Figure <a href="#page-30-0">11</a> shows that for small and large dictionaries, the auditor can verify a single epoch less than 35 ms. This allows light-weight auditors, without needing to outsource the verification to a third party. Also Figure <a href="#page-30-0">11</a> shows that the audit proof size is less than 8 kB.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-8" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">&lt;span id=&quot;page-29-0&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;5.4 Setup size</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A crucial consideration in our scheme is the size and nature of the structured reference string (SRS). The small dictionary requires an srs of size less than 6 Gigabytes, while the large dictionary requires an SRS of size less than 350 Gigabytes. In practice, such SRSs are typically generated via multi-party ceremonies <a href="#page-44-9">[WCB25]</a> that require at least one party to remain honest. The largest SRS generated that we are aware of has been done by Filecoin with a size of approximately 12GB <a href="#page-42-6">[Pro20]</a>. The ceremony is designed to minimize communication among participants. Specifically, each participant obtains the</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">current SRS state from the previous one, verifies its correctness via pairing checks, updates it, and then forwards it to the next participant. On Google c4-highmem-144-lssd with a cost rate of 11.36 USD per hour, generating the SRS for our large dictionary with 2 &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; users (i.e. the underlying polynomial of size 2 &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;) takes almost 1 hour, highlighting the practicality of the approach. For example, if 10 servers jointly perform the generation, the total cost would be about 110 USD and it takes around 10 hours because of the sequential nature of the ceremony. Finally, we emphasize that the KZH SRS is updateable, allowing it to be periodically refreshed through new ceremonies.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-9" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">5.5 Delay between epochs</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A key design parameter in transparent dictionaries is the delay between consecutive epochs. This delay determines how quickly a client's value update is reflected publicly. For example, assume that a client requests to change their value; however, until the next epoch, the server may either continue responding with a stale value or respond with a value that is not yet consistent with the published commitment, updating it in the subsequent epoch. The latter approach is taken by CONIKS <a href="#page-42-1">[Mel+15]</a>, but it is unclear how a client can verify the correctness of such intermediate responses. In contrast, schemes like SEEMless <a href="#page-38-1">[Cha+19]</a> achieve very short epoch intervals (e.g., under one minute) to avoid this issue entirely. In our scheme, updates fall into two categories: (1) assigning indexes to new labels and (2) updating values for existing labels. The second type of update requires only n group operations, where n is the number of labels in an epoch, whereas the first requires a linear number of field operations in the dictionary size. Importantly, these two updates rely on separate underlying polynomials, allowing us to perform them asynchronously. As a result, we can adopt short delays for value updates—similar to SEEMless—thereby preventing stale value responses, while using longer intervals for assigning new indexes to users, which is</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 2: Comparison of WhatsApp AKD over a dictionary of size 100 million and zk-IronDict over a dictionary of size more than 1 billion (2 &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;). For the consistency check of WhatsApp AKD, we assume that the key has been changed 10 times, i.e. its consistency check scales linearly with this number, while the consistency check of IronDict is independent.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">computationally more expensive. This separation avoids introducing inconsistencies due to stale values. Specifically, our index assignment time for dictionaries with fewer than 100 million entries is under a minute, comparable to SEEMless. This allows us to support short epoch durations. However, for a dictionary with a capacity of 1 billion, the index assignment takes approximately 15 minutes. Given recent advancements in hardware acceleration for cryptographic operations <a href="#page-39-9">[Daf+25]</a>, we believe this time can be significantly reduced.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In early systems like CONIKS, the delay between epochs was a critical parameter due to a trade-off between epoch frequency and the cost of consistency proofs. These systems lacked dedicated support for proving consistency, requiring the client to naively check all states between epochs i and j to verify that their value had not changed. Consequently, shorter epoch durations resulted in more epochs between two fixed points in time, making consistency proofs more expensive—and conversely, longer epochs reduced this cost. However, this limitation does not apply to subsequent systems, including ours, as we support an explicit and efficient functionality for consistency proofs.</p>

Despite using a machine with over a terabyte of memory, we were unable to scale the AKD implementation to one billion entries due to memory exhaustion; we therefore restricted our benchmarks to 100 million entries, which already places the evaluation in favor of WhatsApp.<a href="#page-31-1">14</a> We set throughput for both WhatsApp AKD and IronDict to 1000 new users and 1000 udpates per second.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our results in table <a href="#page-31-2">2</a> demonstrate that zk-IronDict has 150000× smaller audit proof size and 300× faster audit verification time compared to WhatsApp AKD, effectively</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;In real-world deployments, the underlying Merkle tree is typically stored on disk, as it does not fit entirely in memory, and is accessed partially from disk, introducing extra costs. For simplicity, we omit these complications in our benchmarks.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">transforming WhatsApp's heavy server-driven auditing into a lightweight, self-auditable process for clients. This considerable improvement does increase the cost of lookups and consistency checks for both client and server, but all remain on the order of 30 ms, which constitutes an acceptable performance trade-off.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 5. WhatsApp, being based on SEEMLESS and Parakeet, client ensures value consistency by retrieving the entire value history. In contrast, we compare our proof of consistency against WhatsApp's value-history approach. Unlike WhatsApp, IronDict's value history requires only a linear number of lookups and consistency proofs with respect to the number of value changes (see Remark <a href="#page-19-1">2)</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Fast-forwarding techniques are general methods that allow auditors or clients to verify a specific state—or more generally, all states leading up to a given state in the dictionary without checking each proof individually. Traditionally, the main approach to fast-forwarding was via IVC, where verifying a single IVC proof suffices to ensure the correctness of all previous steps. IVC is appealing because the proof size and verification time are independent of the number of epochs. However, it imposes a heavy computational burden on the server, as discussed in Section <a href="#page-32-1">6.1.</a> An alternative approach, introduced in VeRSA, is checkpoints, which enable a client to verify that a specific state is correctly derived from the genesis state by checking only a logarithmic number of intermediate epochs. For instance, to verify the correctness of epoch n, it suffices to examine a sublinear sequence of epochs i1, i2, . . . , ilog &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, where i&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 and ilog &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; = n, and ensure that an invariant—such as monotonically increasing version numbers—holds at epoch n. The client then checks that the invariant holds between each consecutive pair (im, im+1) in the sequence. If all checks succeed, the invariant is guaranteed to hold at epoch n. However, in contrast to IVC, this approach offers a weaker guarantee, as it does not ensure the correctness of all intermediate epochs.</p>

    <h3 id="sec-11" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">&lt;span id=&quot;page-32-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;6.1 Fast-forwarding auditors with IVC</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Fast-forwarding is a technique that allows a new auditor joining the system to audit it more efficiently than starting from the genesis epoch and verifying all consecutive epoch proofs. One general solution applied by pervious work <a href="#page-39-4">[Che+20;</a> <a href="#page-44-6">Tzi+22;</a> <a href="#page-44-4">Tya+22]</a>, is to use IVC. At each step, the IVC circuit receives the commitment to the previous step, the commitment to the current step, and a proof of invariance (i.e., the proof auditors are supposed to check) and verifies the correctness of the proof within the circuit. With an IVC scheme, the auditor only needs to verify the IVC proof for the final step. However, auditors must still verify a hash chain at each step. An IVC proof guarantees that updates across a sequence of intermediate states maintain an invariant, leading to a final state. However, there are multiple sequences of intermediate states that could lead to a valid final state. To</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">address this, the bulletin board can store commitments to the intermediate states along with a hash chain h0, h1, h2, . . ., where h&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; = H(hi−1, di) for some hash function H. The IVC additionally verifies the correctness of this hash chain. Using IVC generically also has its drawbacks. Typically, IVC solutions place a heavy computational burden on the server, as verifying the auditor's proof can be expensive to implement in the circuit. However, we estimate our IVC scheme in practice is 2-3 orders of magnitude more efficient for the server than previous work, VeRSA. We describe how the IVC circuit in IronDict is concretely initiated with KZH. Note that the IVC scheme remains efficient for other PCS constructions, as long as they either support an accumulation scheme with low concrete overhead when the accumulation verifier is implemented inside the circuit, or their PCS verification is already inexpensive enough to be directly implemented in the circuit.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">IVC with sublinear proofs and decider (verifier). An IVC scheme is called sublinear <a href="#page-40-5">[Kad+25]</a> if the proofs of correctness for each step and their verification are sublinear in the size of the IVC circuit. This property is crucial in applications such as applying IVC for fast-forwarding auditors, where, unlike the traditional IVC model that focuses only on the final step, we care about proofs for every step due to the ongoing, perpetual nature of the computation—there is no &quot;last&quot; step. Concretely, if the IVC is not sublinear, even moderately sized circuits with 1 million constraints can result in proofs as large as 80 MB <a href="#page-45-1">[Zha+24;</a> <a href="#page-40-5">Kad+25]</a>. To provide some context, IVC can generally be constructed in two ways: (1) using SNARKs <a href="#page-38-7">[Bit+13]</a>, where the SNARK verifier must be embedded inside the circuit; or (2) using accumulation schemes <a href="#page-38-8">[Bü+20;</a> <a href="#page-37-5">B+20</a> ¨ ; <a href="#page-41-8">KST22;</a> <a href="#page-40-5">Kad+25]</a>. SNARK-based IVCs naturally offer succinct proofs and verification at every step. However, embedding the SNARK verifier inside the circuit is concretely very expensive, often dominating the prover's cost. In contrast, accumulation-based IVCs feature a recursion overhead that is much cheaper than the SNARK-based ones. Whether the resulting IVC is sublinear depends on the underlying accumulation scheme: if the accumulation scheme is a sublinear accumulation scheme <a href="#page-40-5">[Kad+25]</a>, then the resulting IVC will also be sublinear, e.g. the IVC scheme based on KZH-fold. A key drawback of SNARK-based IVC that relies on pairing-based SNARKs—such as the one used in VeRSA—is the requirement for a pairing-friendly cycle of elliptic curves. In contrast, accumulation-based IVC, such as KZH-fold, can be initiated based on a half-pairing-friendly cycle, where just one of the two curves supports pairings. Importantly, known pairing-friendly cycles that achieve 128-bit security require curves of approximately 768 bits, while non-recursive constructions typically use 384-bit curves—resulting in an estimated 10× performance overhead in practice <a href="#page-43-9">[SCI19]</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">IVC circuit description for auditor checks. For simplicity, in this section, we assume the use of KZH, leveraging both its homomorphic properties and the existence of an accumulation scheme for its verification function, namely KZH-fold. At a high level, accumulation reduces the verification of two polynomial openings to the verification of</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">a single opening, which can then be checked by the IVC verifier outside the circuit. An overview of the IVC circuit costs can be seen in Table <a href="#page-34-0">3.</a></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Similar to VeRSA and unlike Merkle tree–based approaches, our IVC circuit has a constant size. The IVC circuit used in VeRSA reportedly has ≈ 20M constraints, making ours ≈ 100× smaller. Additionally, our scheme can be instantiated with a half-pairingfriendly curve such as Grumpkin–BN254, while VeRSA requires a pairing-friendly cycle of MNT4-753 and MNT6-753 curves, which introduces an additional 10× efficiency loss in practice <a href="#page-43-9">[SCI19]</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Table 3: Overview of the IVC circuit cost: We assume the IVC circuit is using KZH-k&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; fold, while the dictionary is instantiated with KZH-k2; note that these parameters need not be equal. According to <a href="#page-40-5">[Kad+25]</a>, a single scalar multiplication requires approximately 15,000 constraints; nevertheless, even for k&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 8, the circuit size is expected to remain well below 250,000 constraints. In practice, because the circuit size is relatively small, k&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = 2 is sufficient. For example, even for a circuit of size 1 million constraints, it results in a proof size of 300 kB that can be generated under 5s on an everyday laptop that can be verified in under a second (see Table 5 in <a href="#page-40-5">[Kad+25]</a>).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Checkpoints are proposed in VeRSA as an alternative approach to IVC, specifically designed to reduce the verification overhead for clients that go offline and later come back online. At a high level, consider a client that was last online at epoch i and reconnects at a later epoch j. In traditional systems, such a client would need to verify the correctness of every state transition between epochs i and j, which means checking each intermediate proof individually – an approach that incurs linear cost in the number of skipped epochs. The idea behind checkpoints is to reduce this overhead by enabling the client to validate state transitions more efficiently. Instead of requiring verification of all intermediate epochs, the system introduces special proofs – called checkpoints – that allow clients to skip over multiple epochs at once. For instance, rather than verifying every inclusion index&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; ⊆ indexk+1 for all k ∈ [i, j), the client can verify a smaller number of inclusion proofs, such as index&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; ⊆ indexi+4, indexi+4 ⊆ indexi+8, and so on, depending on the availability of these long-range proofs. This optimization effectively reduces the number of verifications from linear in j − i to logarithmic.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In our work, we propose to apply a similar idea to enable fast self-auditing for clients. Auditing involves of two parts: the index dictionary and the value dictionary. Among</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&lt;span id=&quot;page-35-0&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    <img src="_page_35_Figure_0.jpeg" alt="" class="my-4 max-w-full" />
</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Figure 12: Consider an example with 16 epochs. Apart from proofs index&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; ⊆ indexi+1 published on BB, the server precomputes and stores checkpoint proofs for longer-range transitions with step sizes of 2, 4, 8, and 16. Suppose a client goes offline at epoch 3 and returns at epoch 14. Instead of verifying all 11 intermediate updates, the client can use a minimal set of checkpoint proofs: index&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ⊆ index4, index&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; ⊆ index8, index&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; ⊆ index12, and index&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; ⊆ index14.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">these, the index dictionary proof is significantly more expensive – it requires a multi-pairing and has a proof size of k · N1/k, whereas auditing the value dictionary only involves a small number of hashes and group operations. Therefore, reducing the number of index dictionary proofs a client needs to check is particularly beneficial. To achieve this, we introduce checkpoints specifically for index dictionary proofs. The idea is based on the fact that the index dictionary proof establishes that it is append-only, i.e. index&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; ⊆ indexi+1. By generalizing this, the server can also produce proofs that cover larger steps – for example, index&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; ⊆ indexi+2, index&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; ⊆ indexi+4, and so on. More precisely, for every k ∈ N, the server maintains a proof that indexm·&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; ⊆ index(m+1)·&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; , without publishing them on BB. When a client returns after being offline, it can use these precomputed proofs to validate the state by following a path defined by a binary decomposition of j −i, skipping over epochs in powers of two. This reduces both the computational and communication costs of verification, enabling much faster auditing without compromising soundness. We illustrate the approach with an example in Figure <a href="#page-35-0">12.</a> While this approach still requires the client to perform linear work to verify the correctness of the commitments to the value dictionary, this verification involves only a constant number of hashes and group operations per epoch, making it lightweight and not a computational bottleneck.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Checkpoints are specifically designed to support self-auditing by clients, rather than external auditing. This distinction arises because when a client uses checkpoints to skip from epoch i to epoch i + 2, it may never verify whether the intermediate transition index&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; ⊆ indexi+1 holds. As a result, if epoch i + 1 is incorrect, a self-auditing client might never detect it (note that epoch i + 2 is still correct). However, this is not a concern for the client, since its goal is to ensure the correctness of the current epoch rather than validating the integrity of all prior epochs. In contrast, the IVC-based approach is designed</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">so that checking the correctness of a given epoch also guarantees the validity of all preceding epochs. This property makes IVC suitable for fast-forwarding <em>auditors</em>, while the checkpoint mechanism is more appropriate for clients performing lightweight self-auditing.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">An important aspect of designing transparent dictionaries is optimizing the server's memory usage. For instance, if the server stores a full copy of the dictionary at every epoch, the storage cost increases swiftly. We present a strategy to reduce memory consumption without imposing a heavy computational burden. This strategy is tailored to IRONDICT when instantiated with KZH, leveraging homomorphic properties of the KZH construction.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Memory optimization via difference vectors. A key optimization for reducing serverside memory usage is to store only the difference vectors between adjacent epochs rather than the full dictionary at each epoch. We demonstrate the idea in the setting where IRONDICT is instantiated with KZH-2; the case for KZH-k with k &gt; 2 is similar. In KZH-2, the dictionary values are organized as a  <span class="math">\\sqrt{N} \\times \\sqrt{N}</span>  matrix. In each epoch, the server computes row commitments  <span class="math">\\{D_i\\}</span> , which serve as auxiliary inputs during openings. An opening for any value in the dictionary consists of the row commitments  <span class="math">\\{D_i\\}</span>  and one of the rows from the matrix. Let the changes in the next epoch be represented by  <span class="math">\\Delta = \\{(x_i, y_i, \\delta_i)\\}_{i \\in [n]}</span> , where  <span class="math">(x_i, y_i)</span>  denotes a matrix position and  <span class="math">\\delta_i</span>  is the updated value at that position. Instead of storing the entire updated matrix, the server only keeps the difference vector  <span class="math">\\Delta</span> . When an opening is needed, the server reconstructs the target row by applying  <span class="math">\\Delta</span>  to the corresponding row from the previous epoch, requiring at most min <span class="math">\\{\\sqrt{N}, n\\}</span>  value replacements. However, recomputing the updated row commitments  <span class="math">\\{D_i\\}</span>  from scratch would still involve O(n)group operations. To avoid this, the server precomputes and stores the updated row commitments once per epoch, which adds only  <span class="math">O(\\sqrt{N})</span>  storage overhead. This technique naturally generalizes to multiple epochs. By maintaining the difference vectors  <span class="math">\\Delta_1, \\ldots, \\Delta_k</span> for the past k epochs, the server can reconstruct any row in the current dictionary from the snapshot stored k epochs ago using at most  <span class="math">O(k \\cdot n)</span>  value replacements—without performing any additional group operations or storing full copies of the dictionary for each intermediate epoch.</p>

      <li><span class="math">(vk, pk) \\leftarrow Setup(\\lambda, k)</span> : On input the security parameter  <span class="math">\\lambda</span>  and the number of variables k, this algorithm outputs a pair of verifier key (vk) and prover key (pk). This algorithm might require randomness as nondeterministic input too.</li>
      <li>C  <span class="math">\\leftarrow</span>  Commit(pk,  <span class="math">p(\\vec{X})</span> ): On input pk and a multilinear polynomial  <span class="math">p(\\vec{X})</span> , it outputs a commitment C. This algorithm might take randomness as non-deterministic input too, but for simplicity, we don't consider it here.</li>
      <li><span class="math">\\pi \\leftarrow \\operatorname{Open}(\\operatorname{pk}, p(\\vec{X}), \\vec{x})</span> : On input  <span class="math">\\operatorname{pk}</span> ,  <span class="math">p(\\vec{X})</span> , and vector  <span class="math">\\vec{x} \\in \\mathbb{F}^k</span> , outputs an evaluation proof  <span class="math">\\pi</span>  that  <span class="math">y = p(\\vec{x})</span> .</li>
      <li><span class="math">1/0 \\leftarrow \\text{Verify}(vk, C, \\vec{x}, \\pi, y)</span> : On input vk, the commitment C, vector of evaluations  <span class="math">\\vec{x}, y \\in \\mathbb{F}</span> , and the proof of the correct evaluation, it outputs a bit indicating acceptance or rejection.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A polynomial commitment scheme is said to be secure if it is complete and knowledge-sound as defined below:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Completeness.</strong> It captures the fact that an honest prover will always convince the verifier. Formally, for any efficient adversary  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span> , we have:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Extractability.</strong> Captures the fact that whenever the prover provides a valid opening, it knows a valid pair  <span class="math">(p(\\vec{X}), y)</span> , where  <span class="math">p(\\vec{x}) = y</span> . Formally, for all PPT adversaries  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span> , there exists an efficient extractor  <span class="math">\\mathcal{E}</span>  such that the probability of the following event is negligible:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\Pr\\left[\\begin{array}{c} \\mathsf{Verify}_{\\mathsf{PCS}}\\big(\\mathsf{vk},\\mathsf{C},\\vec{x},\\pi_{\\mathsf{PCS}},y\\big) = 1 \\\\ \\wedge p(\\vec{x}) \\neq y \\end{array} \\right. \\left. \\begin{array}{c} (\\mathsf{vk},\\mathsf{pk}) \\leftarrow \\mathsf{Setup}_{\\mathsf{PCS}}\\big(\\lambda,k\\big), \\\\ \\mathsf{C} \\leftarrow \\mathcal{A}\\big(\\mathsf{vk},\\mathsf{pk}\\big), \\\\ p(\\vec{X}) \\leftarrow \\mathcal{E}\\big((\\mathsf{vk},\\mathsf{pk}),\\mathsf{C},k\\big), \\\\ \\vec{x} \\leftarrow \\mathcal{A}\\big((\\mathsf{vk},\\mathsf{pk}),\\mathsf{C}\\big), \\\\ (y,\\pi_{\\mathsf{PCS}}) \\leftarrow \\mathcal{A}\\big((\\mathsf{vk},\\mathsf{pk}),p(\\vec{X}),\\vec{x}\\big) \\end{array} \\right]</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A transparent dictionary construction is said to be <em>complete</em> if the following holds with probability 1 over the randomness of the honest server and honest setup:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Soundness guarantees that, if there is at least one honest auditor in each round and the auditor accepts the new epoch along with its accompanying proof, then the following properties hold, except with negligible probability:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lookup soundness (binding).</strong> Given a commitment  <span class="math">com_i</span>  to an epoch and a single label  <span class="math">\\ell</span> , the following probability is negligible:</p>

<span class="math">$(\\ell, \\mathsf{state}_i, \\mathsf{state}_j) \\to \\pi_{\\mathrm{consist}},</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where πconsist is a proof consisting of a PCS opening of rand&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; and rand&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt; at point x. The client verifies this proof by checking:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Client. VerConsistency
<span class="math">$(\\ell, com_i, com_j, \\pi_{consist}),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">which internally ensures that both openings of rand&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; and randi+1 at x are valid and satisfy: randi(x) = rand&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt; (x). Assuming the server behaves honestly and all PCS verifications pass, to prove that the value corresponding to label ℓ (or index x) has not changed, it suffices to show that randi(x) = rand&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt; (x). We prove this inductively over the epochs from i to j. Define the difference polynomial: ∆&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; := valuek+1 − valuek. Since the value has not changed at x, we have:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\overline{\\text{value}}_{k+1}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\overline{\\text{value}}_k(\\mathbf{x}) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\overline{\\Delta}_k(\\mathbf{x}) = 0.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">By definition of the random polynomial, we have: randk+1 = rand&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; + r&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; · ∆k, where r&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; is derived via the Fiat-Shamir heuristic. Since ∆k(x) = 0, it follows that: randk+1(x) = randk(x). Applying this inductively for each i ≤ k ≤ j − 1, we conclude: randi(x) = randi+1(x) = · · · = rand&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt; (x). Hence, we've shown that the value at index x (corresponding to label ℓ) hasn't changed between epochs i to j: randi(x) = rand&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt; (x).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Audit correctness. Let epoch i be associated with a set of updates ∆&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; = (∆index, ∆value). Running the update procedure:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">we prove that the auditor accepts the new state, i.e.,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Auditor. VerifyInvariance
<span class="math">$(com_i, com_{i+1}, \\pi_{i+1}) = 1</span>$
.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The proof πi+1 consists of two components: πi+1 = (πregister, πvalue). Note that if the underlying PCS is homomorphic, then πvalue is empty. The auditor's verification process consists of two main checks:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">• Correctness of the randomized value polynomial randi+1: The auditor first recomputes the randomness r&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic and verifies the following relationship between the polynomials:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\overline{\\mathrm{rand}}_{i+1} = \\overline{\\mathrm{rand}}_i + r_i \\cdot \\overline{\\Delta}_i,</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where ∆&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; := valuei+1 − value&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; . This expands to:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\overline{\\operatorname{rand}}_{i+1} = \\overline{\\operatorname{rand}}_i + r_i \\cdot (\\overline{\\operatorname{value}}_{i+1} - \\overline{\\operatorname{value}}_i).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Now, if the PCS is homomorphic, the auditor directly verifies this identity using linearity, and if the PCS is non-homomorphic, the auditor checks the openings of the following polynomials at a random point: rand&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; ,randi+1, value&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; , valuei+1, using the proof πvalue. In either case, due to the definition:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\overline{\\operatorname{rand}}_{i+1} = \\overline{\\operatorname{rand}}_i + r_i \\cdot (\\overline{\\operatorname{value}}_{i+1} - \\overline{\\operatorname{value}}_i),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">the check passes if the server is honest.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">• Correctness of the Index Assignment in indexi+1: The index polynomial indexi+1 updates entries corresponding to the new label indexes. Formally:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\overline{\\mathrm{index}}_{i+1}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\begin{cases} H(\\ell_j) &amp; \\text{if } \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{x}_j, \\\\ \\overline{\\mathrm{index}}_i(\\mathbf{x}) &amp; \\text{otherwise,} \\end{cases}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where x&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt; are the indices of new labels in ∆index. Define the difference polynomial:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\overline{\\delta_i} := \\overline{\\text{index}}_{i+1} - \\overline{\\text{index}}_i.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We now establish the key identity: If δi(x) ̸= 0, then indexi(x) = 0, because new labels are only assigned to previously unassigned indices. This implies:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\overline{\\mathrm{index}}_i(\\mathbf{x}) \\cdot (\\overline{\\mathrm{index}}_{i+1}(\\mathbf{x}) - \\overline{\\mathrm{index}}_i(\\mathbf{x})) = 0 \\ : \\ \\forall \\mathbf{x} \\in \\{0,1\\}^{\\log N}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This implies the zerocheck will pass and hence the auditor accepts πregister.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Both auditor checks succeed; hence, we conclude:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Auditor.VerifyInvariance(com&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; , comi+1, πi+1) = 1.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Lookup soundness. Lookup soundness has two parts: (1) proving a client only accepts a unique index x per label ℓ and (2) for each index x, the state commitment only opens to one single value.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Uniqueness of index: According to the index verification procedure (Algorithm <a href="#page-17-1">4)</a>, the client receives an identifier n and the opening of the polynomial index&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; at the point H(n, ℓ). The client then performs the following checks:    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>For all m &lt; n, it verifies that: indexi(H(m, ℓ)) ̸= H(ℓ)</li>
      <li>It also checks that indexi(H(n, ℓ)) = H(ℓ).</li>
    </ul></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Assuming the PCS is sound—i.e., the adversarial server cannot open the same point to two different values and given the hash function H is deterministic, the client can't accept two different indices x&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; := H(n1, ℓ) and x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; := H(n2, ℓ) for the same label ℓ. Without loss of generality, assume n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; n2. For the client to accept index n2, it must verify that indexi(x1) ̸= H(ℓ); however, accepting index n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; requires verifying that indexi(x1) = H(ℓ). This is a contradiction, violating the binding property of the underlying PCS. It remains to argue that the client continues to accept the same index in all future states. This follows trivially from the append-only nature of the index dictionary. Specifically, once a label ℓ is assigned to an index x := H(n, ℓ), all subsequent index polynomials index&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt; for j &gt; i must preserve the values at x&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; := H(m, ℓ) for all m ≤ n. Therefore, the verification procedure remains unchanged in future epochs.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">• Uniqueness of value: We have established that the client only accepts a single unique index x per label ℓ. Opening the value of a label is thus equivalent to opening the polynomial value&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; at the corresponding index x and checking that H(v) ?&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt; valuei(x). Due to the binding property of the PCS, it is impossible to open valuei(x) to two different values. Additionally, finding two distinct values v&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; such that H(v1) = H(v2) violates the one-to-one mapping described in Section <a href="#page-14-0">4.1</a> and contradicts the collision resistance of the hash function H. Hence, the value corresponding to a label is also unique.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Overall, we conclude it's not possible—but with negligible probability—that the clients accept two different values for one label and hence lookup soundness holds.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Consistency soundness. Before proving consistency soundness, we first prove the following lemma:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Lemma 1. Consider a constant-round interactive protocol by a prover and verifier such that at each round i the prover sends a value a&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; ∈ F and receives a uniform randomness  <span class="math">r_i \\in \\mathbb{F}</span> . Now, if at least one  <span class="math">a_i \\neq 0</span> , we have:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\Pr\\left[\\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} a_i r_i = 0\\right] \\le \\frac{1}{|\\mathbb{F}|}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof.</em> Let  <span class="math">i^*</span>  be the largest index such that  <span class="math">a_{i^*} \\neq 0</span> . Then we can write:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} a_i r_i = \\sum_{i=0}^{i^*} a_i r_i = C + a_{i^*} r_{i^*},</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">C = \\sum_{i=0}^{i^*-1} a_i r_i</span>  is fixed before the verifier samples  <span class="math">r_{i^*}</span> , since it depends only on  <span class="math">r_0, \\ldots, r_{i^*-1}</span> . Because  <span class="math">r_{i^*}</span>  is sampled uniformly at random from  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span> , and  <span class="math">a_{i^*} \\neq 0</span> , the term  <span class="math">a_{i^*} r_{i^*}</span>  is uniformly random in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span> . Therefore,  <span class="math">C + a_{i^*} r_{i^*}</span>  is also uniformly random, and so:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\Pr\\left[C + a_{i^*} r_{i^*} = 0\\right] = \\frac{1}{|\\mathbb{F}|}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Hence, the probability that  <span class="math">\\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} a_i r_i = 0</span>  is at most  <span class="math">\\frac{1}{|\\mathbb{F}|}</span> , completing the proof.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We prove that the construction in Section 4.5 satisfies consistency soundness, based on the lemma above. Consider the interactive protocol underlying the construction: in each round, the prover sends the polynomials  <span class="math">\\overline{\\text{index}}_{i+1}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\overline{\\text{value}}_{i+1}</span> , and receives a random field element  <span class="math">r_i</span>  from the verifier. The prover then computes</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\overline{\\operatorname{rand}}_{i+1} := \\overline{\\operatorname{rand}}_i + r_i \\cdot (\\overline{\\operatorname{value}}_{i+1} - \\overline{\\operatorname{value}}_i).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  be a label, and let  <span class="math">\\mathbf{x}</span>  denote its corresponding index. Suppose that between epochs n and m, the value associated with  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  changes at least once. To prove consistency soundness, it suffices to show that  <span class="math">\\overline{\\mathrm{rand}}_n(\\mathbf{x}) \\neq \\overline{\\mathrm{rand}}_m(\\mathbf{x})</span>  except with negligible probability. The reason is sufficient is that the server has to open these values  <span class="math">\\overline{\\mathrm{rand}}_n(\\mathbf{x})</span>  and  <span class="math">\\overline{\\mathrm{rand}}_m(\\mathbf{x})</span>  to the client. Since the underlying PCS is binding and sound, the server cannot cheat and therefore opens the correct values. Define:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\delta(\\mathbf{x}) := \\overline{\\mathrm{rand}}_m(\\mathbf{x}) - \\overline{\\mathrm{rand}}_n(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{i=n}^{m-1} r_i \\cdot \\overline{\\Delta_i}(\\mathbf{x}),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">\\overline{\\Delta_i} := \\overline{\\text{value}}_{i+1} - \\overline{\\text{value}}_i</span> . By assumption, at least one  <span class="math">\\overline{\\Delta_i}(\\mathbf{x}) \\neq 0</span> . From the lemma above, we know that a non-trivial linear combination of independent random field elements is non-zero with all but negligible probability. Since each  <span class="math">r_i</span>  is sampled independently of  <span class="math">\\overline{\\Delta_i}</span> , and at least one coefficient is non-zero, we conclude:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\Pr[\\delta(\\mathbf{x}) = 0] \\le 1/|\\mathbb{F}|.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Thus,  <span class="math">\\overline{\\text{rand}}_n(\\mathbf{x}) = \\overline{\\text{rand}}_m(\\mathbf{x})</span>  only with negligible probability. Finally, since the protocol involves a constant number of rounds and the verifier's challenges are random field elements, it can be compiled into a non-interactive protocol using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic with soundness error remaining negligible [FS87; AFK23].</p>

To simplify the protocol, we assume the auxiliary input of KZH is part of the opening and is generated while opening, while in reality, the prover can compute it during commitment and store it as cache.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A general technique for transforming a homomorphic PCS to be hiding is using a sigma protocol (see <a href="#page-37-3">[B+21</a> ¨ ]). The key idea is to blind the original commitment C to a polynomial f(X) to achieve hiding. During evaluation, the prover sends the evaluation f(⃗x) along with a commitment R to a fully random polynomial r(X) of the same degree as f(X), and the evaluation r(⃗x) to the verifier. The verifier then samples a random challenge α ∈ F, and the prover proves that the combined and unblinded commitment α × C + R opens to α · f(⃗x) + r(⃗x) at ⃗x. Prior work <a href="#page-40-8">[HKR19]</a> showed that for Bulletproofs, it suffices for r(X) to have only a logarithmic number of non-zero coefficients, significantly reducing the prover's computational overhead. We make a similar observation in the context of the KZH-k scheme, where it is sufficient for r(X) to have only k · N1/k non-zero terms, as established in Lemmas <a href="#page-54-0">4</a> and <a href="#page-55-0">5.</a> Let</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&lt;span id=&quot;page-54-0&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;<strong>Lemma 4.</strong> Let the multilinear polynomial r be defined as:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$r(\\underbrace{X_1,\\ldots,X_n}_{\\mathbf{X}},\\underbrace{Y_1,\\ldots,Y_n}_{\\mathbf{Y}}) = \\sum_{i\\in[n]} r_i \\cdot \\operatorname{eq}(\\mathbf{X},\\vec{x}) + r^*(\\mathbf{Y}),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">such that  <span class="math">r_i</span> 's and polynomial  <span class="math">r^*(\\mathbf{X})</span>  are uniformly random. Using such randomized polynomial r is sufficient such that opening to  <span class="math">f(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y})</span>  at the point  <span class="math">(\\vec{x}, \\vec{y})</span>  remains hiding (i.e., zero-knowledge), when KZH-2 scheme is transformed to be hiding and zero-knowledge as outlined in Figure 13.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof.</em> The hiding property is straightforward, as it is ensured by the hiding factor  <span class="math">\\tau</span> , which remains unchanged. To establish that the opening is zero-knowledge, it suffices to show that the distribution of the proof vector generated for a specific r is indistinguishable from the distribution of a proof vector generated using a fully random polynomial, as required by the original compiler. Formally, we show that the transcript generated by the simulator in Lemma 2, is identical to an honest transcript using limited randomness for r. We prove the statement assuming f = 0. By linearity of the commitment and proof, the same holds for an arbitrary f. First, we define the multilinear polynomial  <span class="math">r(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y})</span>  as:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$r(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y}) = \\sum_{i \\in [n]} r_i \\cdot \\operatorname{eq}(\\mathbf{X}, \\vec{i}) + r^*(\\mathbf{Y}),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$r(\\vec{i}, \\mathbf{Y}) = r_i + r^*(\\mathbf{Y}) \\implies D_i := \\operatorname{com}(r_i + r^*(\\mathbf{Y})).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The partial evaluation at a fixed input ⃗x becomes:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$r(\\vec{x}, \\mathbf{Y}) = \\sum_{i \\in [n]} r_i \\cdot \\operatorname{eq}(\\vec{x}, \\vec{i}) + r^*(\\mathbf{Y}) \\implies \\pi = \\left( \\left\\{ \\operatorname{com}(r_i + r^*(\\mathbf{Y})) \\right\\}_{i \\in [n]}, \\ r(\\vec{x}, \\mathbf{Y}) \\right)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since each commitment D&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; contains a unique random term r&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; , the commitments are independent and uniformly distributed. Moreover, the term r(⃗x, Y) is identical to a partial evaluation of a random polynomial and the direct linear combination of the polynomials within the Dis, just as in the simulated proof. Thus, the entire proof vector π is distributed identically to the case when r(X, Y) is sampled as a fully random polynomial, ensuring zero-knowledge.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&lt;span id=&quot;page-55-0&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Lemma 5. Let r be a multilinear polynomial defined as follows, where each X&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; consists of n variables. Thus, r has a total of k · n variables:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$r(\\mathbf{X}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{X}_k) := \\sum_{j \\in [k]} \\sum_{i \\in [n]} r_{i,j} \\cdot \\mathsf{eq}(\\mathbf{X}_j, \\vec{i}),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where each ri,j is sampled uniformly at random. Using such a randomized polynomial r is sufficient to ensure that the opening to f(X, Y) at the point (⃗x, ⃗y) remains hiding (i.e., zero-knowledge), when the KZH-k scheme is transformed to be hiding and zero-knowledge as described in Figure <a href="#page-52-0">13.</a></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Proof. Similar to the KZH-2 case, we show that the opening proof for such a polynomial r is distributed identically to that of a truly random polynomial. This implies that the opening reveals no additional information, thereby preserving zero-knowledge. Given r and how the D⃗ &lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; vectors are computed in KZH-k opening, we see that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$D_{j&#x27;}[i&#x27;] = r_{i&#x27;,j&#x27;} + \\sum_{j&#x27; \\le j} \\sum_{i \\in [n]} r_{i,j} \\cdot \\operatorname{eq}(\\mathbf{X}_j, \\vec{i})</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Using reasoning similar to the proof of Lemma <a href="#page-54-0">4,</a> each D&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt; [i] contains independent randomness ri,j and as a result, all D&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt; [i] are independently and uniformly distributed. The final opening message is</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$r(\\vec{x}_1, \\dots, \\vec{x}_{k-1}, X_k) = r_k(\\vec{X}_k) + \\sum_{\\substack{j \\in [k-1] \\\\ i \\in [n]}} r_{i,j} \\cdot \\operatorname{eq}(x_j, \\vec{i}),</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and is a random univariate degree n polynomial, that is homomorphically consistent with all D&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt; [i] terms. The resulting proof is indistinguishable from one generated using a truly random polynomial r.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-15" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">&lt;span id=&quot;page-56-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;D.3 Checking homomorphic relations over blinded commitments</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A drawback of using blinded commitments is that we can no longer check homomorphic relations directly, since the hiding parameters on the two sides of the relation may differ. The problem reduces to verifying that two PCS commitments,  <span class="math">\\mathsf{com}_1</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathsf{com}_2</span> , which use different hiding factors, correspond to the same polynomial. A straightforward approach is to open both commitments at a random evaluation point and check whether they yield the same value; by the Schwartz–Zippel lemma [Sch80; Zip79], this guarantees that the underlying polynomials are equal with high probability. However, this requires two PCS openings, which is expensive. A more efficient approach is to check whether  <span class="math">\\mathsf{com}_1 - \\mathsf{com}_2</span>  opens to the zero polynomial, i.e., that it equals  <span class="math">h^c</span>  for some  <span class="math">c \\in \\mathbb{F}</span> , where h is the hiding generator. This can be done using a simple sigma protocol requiring only a constant number of operations. In conclusion, checking homomorphic identities with blinded commitments requires a sigma protocol, which incurs only a constant overhead for both the server and the auditor.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Description of KZH-k can be seen in Figure 14. We define an asymmetric pairing group as a tuple  <span class="math">(p, g_1, g_2, \\mathbb{G}_1, \\mathbb{G}_2, \\mathbb{G}_T, e)</span> , where p denotes the order of the groups  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_2</span> , and e is an efficiently computable, non-degenerate bilinear map. Let  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span>  be the finite field such that the scalars of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1</span>  lie in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}</span> . We adopt additive notation: for any  <span class="math">a \\in \\mathbb{F}</span>  and  <span class="math">G \\in \\mathbb{G}_1</span> , scalar multiplication is written as  <span class="math">a \\times G</span> . We assume G is a generator of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}_1</span> , and G is a generator of G. For a multilinear polynomial  <span class="math">f(\\vec{X}_1, \\vec{X}_2, \\dots, \\vec{X}_k)</span> , we denote  <span class="math">f_{\\vec{b}_1, \\vec{b}_2, \\dots, \\vec{b}_i}</span>  as the partial evaluation</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$f(\\vec{b}_1, \\vec{b}_2, \\dots, \\vec{b}_i, \\vec{X}_{i+1}, \\dots, \\vec{X}_k).</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Free Boolean opening. A subtle point in Figure 14 is that although the auxiliary inputs are computed during the commitment phase for all j=1 to k-1, only those with  <span class="math">j \\leq \\lfloor k/2 \\rfloor</span>  are actually used in the opening phase. This is because the opening procedure in Figure 14 is designed for the general case of evaluating at a random point  <span class="math">(\\vec{x}_1, \\vec{x}_2, \\ldots, \\vec{x}_k)</span> . To allow for free Boolean opening, we compute the full auxiliary input. In the special case of Boolean points, the summation in Equation (2) reduces to selecting a single value  <span class="math">\\max_{\\vec{b}_1, \\ldots, \\vec{b}_{j-1}, \\vec{b}}</span> . This is due to the fact that  <span class="math">\\exp((\\vec{x}_1, \\ldots, \\vec{x}_{j-1}), (\\vec{b}_1, \\ldots, \\vec{b}_{j-1}))</span>  vanishes everywhere on the Boolean hypercube except at  <span class="math">(\\vec{b}_1, \\ldots, \\vec{b}_{j-1}) = (\\vec{x}_1, \\ldots, \\vec{x}_{j-1})</span> . Consequently, openings at Boolean points come essentially for free.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">Arithmetization-Oriented primitives are the building block of advanced cryptographic protocols such as Zero-Knowledge proof systems. One approach to designing such primitives is the HADES design strategy which aims to provide an efficient way to instantiate generalizing substitution-permutation networks to include partial S-box rounds. A notable instance of HADES, introduced by Grassi \\emph{et al.} at USENIX Security &#x27;21, is Poseidon. Because of its impressive efficiency and low arithmetic complexity, Poseidon is a popular choice among the designers of integrity-proof systems. An updated version of Poseidon, namely, Poseidon2 was published at AfricaCrypt &#x27;23 aiming to improve the efficiency of Poseidon by optimizing its linear operations. 
    In this work, we show some caveats in the security argument of HADES against algebraic attacks and quantify the complexity of Gr\\&quot;{o}bner basis attacks. We show that the complexity of the attack is lower than claimed with the direct implication that there are cases where the recommended number of rounds is insufficient for meeting the claimed security. Concretely, the complexity of a Gr\\&quot;{o}bner basis attack for an instance of Poseidon with 1024 bits of security is 731.77 bits and the original security argument starts failing already at the 384-bit security level. Since the security of Poseidon2 is derived from the security of Poseidon, the same analysis applies to the instances of Poseidon2.  The results were shared with the designers and the security arguments were updated accordingly.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Arithmetization-Oriented (AO) primitives are a common building block for advanced cryptographic protocols such as Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs, Multiparty Computation (MPC), and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). AO primitives are usually defined over a finite field of large order and designed to have a simple and efficient algebraic representation. Examples of such primitives are Rescue <a href="#page-16-0">[4]</a>, Rescue-Prime <a href="#page-19-0">[41]</a>, RPO <a href="#page-16-1">[6]</a>, and Chaghri <a href="#page-16-2">[7]</a> which are designed based on the Marvellous design strategy <a href="#page-16-0">[4]</a>, Griffin <a href="#page-18-0">[26]</a> and Anemoi <a href="#page-17-0">[14]</a> which are Feistel-like designs, Poseidon <a href="#page-18-1">[29]</a> and Poseidon2 <a href="#page-18-2">[30]</a> based on HADES design strategy, and more examples such as MiMC <a href="#page-16-3">[2]</a>, LowMC <a href="#page-16-4">[3]</a>, Kreyvium <a href="#page-17-1">[15]</a>, FLIP <a href="#page-19-1">[38]</a>, Rasta <a href="#page-18-3">[21]</a>, Dasta <a href="#page-19-2">[33]</a>, Pasta <a href="#page-18-4">[22]</a>, Fasta <a href="#page-17-2">[17]</a>, Elisabeth <a href="#page-17-3">[18]</a>, Rubato <a href="#page-19-3">[32]</a>, Tip5 <a href="#page-19-4">[42]</a>, and XHash <a href="#page-16-5">[5]</a> to name just a few.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A promising approach for designing efficient AO primitives is the HADES design strategy. Poseidon and its successor Poseidon2 are the most important and widely used hash functions designed based on the HADES approach which are sponge functions <a href="#page-17-4">[10]</a> instantiated by the Poseidon<sup>&pi;</sup> and Poseidon2<sup>&pi;</sup> permutations. Poseidon2, optimizes the linear layers of Poseidon to improve efficiency and mitigate the attack proposed in <a href="#page-17-5">[9]</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The HADES design strategy allows the designers to optimize the combination of substitution-permutation network (SPN) and Partial SPN <a href="#page-18-5">[25]</a> (PSPN) to derive an efficient design while not jeopardizing security. In HADES, SPN is referred to as full layers and used to justify arguments for the primitive's resistance against statistical attacks using the wide trail strategy. Then, PSPN is referred to as partial rounds with the goal to not only improve the performance of the design but also in combination with full layers ensure resistance against algebraic attack. Indeed, it is claimed that both full and partial layers provide same resistance in case of algebraic attacks <a href="#page-18-6">[31]</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The security of the HADES approach is based on an extensive analysis of various techniques such as:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Statistical attacks: Differential cryptanalysis, linear cryptanalysis.</li>
      <li>Algebraic attacks: Interpolations attacks <a href="#page-19-5">[34]</a>, Gr&ouml;bner basis attacks <a href="#page-17-6">[19]</a>, Higher-Order differential attacks <a href="#page-19-6">[36]</a>, and Zero-Sum partitions attacks <a href="#page-17-7">[13]</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The security arguments of HADES and its instances were scrutinized by third-party cryptanalysts which presented security vulnerabilities exploiting the partial layers <a href="#page-17-8">[12,</a><a href="#page-19-7">35]</a>. It has been observed that in some cases, the linear layer results in invariant subspaces in partial layers. Subsequently, the security arguments and suggested secure parameters were updated accordingly by imposing additional constraints on the choice of the linear layer in the partial layer. Later, <a href="#page-17-5">[9]</a> showed how to bypass two full rounds as an auxiliary approach for mounting algebraic attacks but no parameter sets were yet shown to be vulnerable. Sauer designed an algebraic attack on Poseidon <a href="#page-19-8">[39]</a> and showed that the resistance of Poseidon against Gr&ouml;bner basis attacks is overstated. However, he did not provide any instance that is indeed vulnerable.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our contributions. We investigate the feasibility of Gr&ouml;bner basis attacks against Poseidon and Poseidon2 as the most important instances of HADES. Our approach is to conduct a thorough security analysis against the CICO problem in the context of Gr&ouml;ber basis attacks, which are considered to be among the most promising algebraic attacks against AO designs <a href="#page-16-6">[1]</a>.<a href="#page-1-0">5</a></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>5</sup> See also <a href="#page-18-1">[29,</a> Sec. 5.2]</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To estimate the complexity of Gr&ouml;bner basis attacks, we approximate the solving degree by computing the Gr&ouml;bner basis for toy parameters and extrapolate the solving degree. Extrapolation of the solving degree is a common approach in the cryptography community to compute the Gr&ouml;bner basis complexity <a href="#page-16-0">[4</a><a href="#page-19-0">,41</a><a href="#page-16-1">,6,</a><a href="#page-19-4">42,</a><a href="#page-17-0">14</a><a href="#page-17-5">,9]</a>. The solving degree shows that the polynomial system describing Poseidon is not regular, and using the degree of regularity to bound the solving degree results in over-estimation of the provided security <a href="#page-19-8">[39]</a>. Moreover, in the design of HADES, it is believed that partial rounds provide the same security resistance against algebraic attacks as full rounds.<a href="#page-2-0">6</a> We demonstrate that in cases where the state size is larger than two, partial rounds offer less resistance against Gr&ouml;bner basis attacks than full rounds. To show the impact of our observations and as a proof of concept, we demonstrate an instance with 1024 bits of security which is broken by our approach; the complete parameter set can be found in Table <a href="#page-2-1">1.</a></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The proposed algebraic attacks suggest that the partial layers do not provide the expected level of security against algebraic attacks, requiring that the security argument be re-evaluated for instances following this design strategy.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Additionally, we conducted a more thorough investigation into Poseidon's security argument with respect to the claimed resistance against algebraic attacks. We revealed three distinct flaws in these arguments, each of which has implications for the required number of rounds. First, we show a typo in the security argument against Gr&ouml;bner basis attacks in the full round setting. Then, we show that the logical reasoning for the security argument against the Gr&ouml;bner basis attack is not sound. Finally, we present an error in the symbolic computation of bounds that undermines security.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-2.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2.2 Multivariate polynomial systems</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let K be a field, the polynomial ring  <span class="math">K[x_1, \\ldots, x_n]</span>  is a set of all polynomials in the variables  <span class="math">x_1, \\ldots, x_n</span>  and coefficients in K.

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\begin{cases} P_1(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = 0 \\\\ P_2(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = 0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ P_m(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = 0 \\end{cases}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The polynomial systems typically describing AO hash functions span a zerodimensional ideal, meaning that the set containing all their solutions is finite. One can use Gr&ouml;bner basis to solve multivariate polynomial systems. The steps to solve a multivariate polynomial system using one of the Gr&ouml;bner basis algorithms are:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Compute a Gr&ouml;bner basis with respect to degrevlex term order.</li>

      <li>Convert the Gr&ouml;bner basis to lex term order.</li>

      <li>Find the roots of the polynomial system by factoring univariate polynomials and extending the partial solutions.</li>
    </ol></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The primary motivation for first computing the Gr&ouml;bner basis in degrevlex order is its lower complexity compared to other term orderings. Complexity of Step 1. The complexity of computing a Gr&ouml;bner basis in degrevlex term order is upper bounded by <a href="#page-17-9">[11]</a>:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$O\\left(\\binom{n+d_{sol}}{d_{sol}}^{\\omega}\\right),\\tag{1}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where n is the number of variables in the multivariate polynomial system and dsol is the solving degree of the polynomial system <a href="#page-18-8">[20]</a>. Solving degree is defined as the highest degree of the polynomials involved in the computation of the Gr&ouml;bner basis using the F5 algorithm. In the case of regular systems, the solving degree matches the Macaulay bound which is defined as:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$d_{sol} = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (d_i - 1) + 1,</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where d<sup>i</sup> is the polynomial degree of P<sup>i</sup> for 1 &le; i &le; m.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">However, most of the AO primitives, when modeled as a polynomial system, are not regular systems <a href="#page-16-0">[4,</a><a href="#page-19-8">39,</a><a href="#page-17-5">9]</a>, and in most of the cases, the solving degree grows slower than the Macaulay bound.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To determine the solving degree, the current approach used in design and cryptanalysis is to compute the solving degrees of round-reduced versions of the system, and extrapolate a bound for it <a href="#page-16-0">[4</a><a href="#page-16-6">,1,</a><a href="#page-17-5">9,</a><a href="#page-19-8">39,</a><a href="#page-17-0">14]</a>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Complexity of Step 2. The computed Gr&ouml;bner basis in degrevlex order is usually complicated and not useful for solving the system. Therefore, it is converted to a Gr&ouml;bner basis in lex order. The conversion is performed using the FGLM <a href="#page-18-9">[23]</a> algorithm and the complexity is upper bounded by:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$O\\left(nD^3\\right)</span>$
,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where D is the degree of the zero-dimensional ideal. In some cases, this step can be performed more efficiently using the sparse FGLM <a href="#page-18-10">[24]</a> algorithm which has asymptotic complexity of:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$O(\\sqrt{6/n\\pi}D^{2+\\frac{n-1}{n}}). (2)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Complexity of Step 3. When the ideal is zero-dimensional (as is the case for us), the Gr&ouml;bner basis in the lex order contains a unique univariate polynomial that can be factored and is used to iteratively solve the entire system. When the unique univariate polynomial is factored, it results in a partial solution to the system. In an iterative process, partial solutions are substituted in other polynomials, and these are factored in a similar way until a full solution is obtained solving a univariate polynomial system of degree D defined over the finite field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  the Cantor/Zassenhaus [16] algorithm can be used with complexity [40]:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The Sponge construction [10] is a generic method for constructing a hash function from a fixed-length public permutation.

The sponge function F with rate r and capacity c where r+c=n, takes as input  <span class="math">\\mathbf{M}</span>  of arbitrary length, and after applying a padding function, generates the output  <span class="math">\\mathbf{H}</span> . The length of the padded input and the output of F is a multiple of r. The sponge function works as follows:</p>

For each  <span class="math">i \\in 1, 2, \\dots, \\chi</span> , the  <span class="math">\\mathbf{M}_i</span>  is added to the first r blocks of  <span class="math">\\mathbf{S}</span>  and the function f is applied i.e.,</li>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The security of Poseidon is analyzed against various attacks in order to compute the reliable number of required rounds. The authors provided a script to facilitate the computation of the number of rounds<a href="#page-8-1">7</a> . In our analysis, we utilized this script to calculate the necessary number of rounds required to ensure the security of our chosen parameters. Currently, the scripts are updated after communicating the results with the authors.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-3.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3.2 Flaws in the Security Analysis of Poseidon</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In addition to the flaw described in Section <a href="#page-11-0">4,</a> we identified three more minor flaws which, when combined, increase the likelihood of an attack to exist. In Section <a href="#page-8-2">3.2,</a> we demonstrate that using loose bounds in security arguments leads to incorrect conclusions. In Section <a href="#page-10-0">3.2,</a> we investigate the security argument against Gr&ouml;bner basis attacks in the case of &chi; = 1, where the system is already a Gr&ouml;bner basis in the full-permutation setting. We highlight a typo causing an underestimation of the required number of rounds. Finally, in Section <a href="#page-11-1">3.2,</a> we identify a flaw in the symbolic computations of round-level Gr&ouml;bner basis analysis that led to an overclaiming of the security.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Improper Logic The argument for determining the number of rounds that is safe against a Gr&ouml;bner basis attack can be summarized as follows <a href="#page-18-1">[29,</a> Section 5.5.2]:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>Assume that all values for R<sup>F</sup> , R<sup>P</sup> higher than R<sup>&lowast;</sup> F , R<sup>&lowast;</sup> P cannot be attacked and are secure.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The problem arises due to Step 2, where a lower bound should be used. As a result, Step 4 concludes resistance against adversaries that Step 3 did not handle.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Consider a simple example: let us assume that a sponge construction with rate r uses an N-round permutation; further, assume an attack with complexity 2 <sup>3</sup>N r. However, this expression may be challenging to work with (e.g., because 3 is odd and we wish to take a square root) so we attempt to simplify it by noting that 2 <sup>3</sup>N r &le; 2 <sup>4</sup>N r, although this is not a tight upper bound. Using the argumentation shown above, we find N<sup>&lowast;</sup> from:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$2^{4N^*r} = 2^{\\lambda}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Solving for N<sup>&lowast;</sup> yields</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$N^* = \\frac{\\lambda}{4r}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Consequently, for all 0 &le; N &le; N<sup>&lowast;</sup> , a sponge function using the N-round permutation can be attacked. This is still a true statement. Using the above argumentation, it is then conjectured that the sponge function is safe from attacks for all N &ge; N<sup>&lowast;</sup> = &lambda; 4r . This is not a true statement as now using the proper expression to find a safe number of rounds Ns, we obtain</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$2^{3N_s r} = 2^{\\lambda},</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and find:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$N_s = \\frac{\\lambda}{3r}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Therefore, for all 0 &le; N &le; Ns, the sponge function can be attacked, and for all N &gt; Ns, the sponge function is safe for the given security level. The problem is that for N<sup>&lowast;</sup> &le; N &le; Ns, we argued that the sponge construction with N rounds is safe, while it is not the case. When using Step 3 and Step 4 outlined earlier, one should use a lower bound rather than an upper bound in Step 2, as it may result in an overestimation of the resistance of the sponge function against attacks.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Similarly, the resistance of Poseidon against a round-level Gr&ouml;bner basis attack is found to be (up to reasonable approximation) <a href="#page-18-1">[29]</a>:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$C_{\\rm GB} = 2^{Cq - C&#x27;},</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">with</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$C = 2\\log_2\\left(\\frac{\\alpha^{\\alpha}}{(\\alpha - 1)^{\\alpha - 1}}\\right)</span>$
<span class="math">$C&#x27; = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi(\\alpha - 1)q}{\\alpha}\\right)</span>$
<span class="math">$q = (t - 1)R_F + R_P + \\chi</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">That concludes Step 1. In Step 2, this approximation was upper-bounded by:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">
<span class="math">$C_{GB} = 2^{C \\cdot q - C&#x27;} \\le 2^{C \\cdot q}, \\tag{3}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Ultimately, resistance against the round-level attack is assumed as long as:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(t-1)R_F + R_P \\ge C^{-1}\\min\\{\\lambda, \\log_2(p)\\} - 1,\\tag{4}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since (3) is not a tight bound (4) necessarily underestimates the required number of round. The effect of this omission is more noticeable when  <span class="math">\\alpha</span> , state size t, and rate r grow.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Transcription Error Full-Permutation Equation</strong>. In the full round equation setting [29, Section C.2.2], a system of equations for the entire R rounds is derived by considering each input as a variable and applying the round functions to them. When the number of input variables  <span class="math">\\chi</span>  is the same as the number of output variables, the resulting system will consist of  <span class="math">\\chi</span>  equations in  <span class="math">\\chi</span>  variables, and the degree of each polynomial is upper-bounded by  <span class="math">D_{\\alpha}(R) = \\alpha^{R}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">When  <span class="math">\\chi=1</span> , the system consists of a single polynomial of degree at most  <span class="math">\\alpha^R</span>  in one variable, which is already a Gr&ouml;bner basis in lex order. Therefore, the only step required to complete the attack is the factorization of the univariate polynomial. Per the security argument provided in [29, Section C.2.2], one should have:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\log_2\\left(\\alpha^{\\omega R}\\right) \\geq \\log_2\\left(\\alpha^{2R}\\right) \\geq \\min\\{\\lambda, \\log_2(p)\\},</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">which implies:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$R \\geq \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\min\\{\\lambda, \\log_2(p)\\}}{2\\log_2\\alpha} \\right\\rceil = \\log_\\alpha(2) \\cdot \\min\\{\\frac{\\lambda}{\\mathbf{2}}, \\frac{\\log_2(p)}{2}\\},</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">R = R_F + R_P</span> . Later, the designers in [29, Equation 11], write the constraint for the full round attack as:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$R_F + R_P \\ge \\log_{\\alpha}(2) \\cdot \\min\\{\\frac{\\lambda}{3}, \\frac{\\log_2(p)}{2}\\},\\tag{5}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where the denominator of the fraction  <span class="math">\\frac{\\lambda}{3}</span>  is 3 instead of 2. This mistake results in an overestimation of the security that the Poseidon permutation provides against Gr&ouml;bner basis attacks in the case where  <span class="math">\\chi = 1</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As an example of how the mistake influences the number of rounds, the constraint in [29, Equation 5] would imply that 6 full rounds and 22 partial rounds are sufficient for  <span class="math">\\alpha=3, t=2, p\\approx 2^{1024}</span> , and a desired security level of 128 bits, whereas to gain that security level for these parameters, at least 35 partial rounds are required.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Symbolic Computation Error In <a href="#page-18-1">[29,</a> Section C.2.2] it is shown that for security level of &lambda;, the maximum number of rounds that can be attacked using Gr&ouml;bner basis is:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">
<span class="math">$(t-1)R_F + R_P + \\chi \\le C^{-1} \\cdot \\min\\{\\lambda, \\log_2(p)\\chi\\},</span>$

    <p class="text-gray-300">The designers argue that the maximal number of rounds that can be attacked is when &chi; = 1 <a href="#page-18-1">[29,</a> Section C.2.2] but this is not true. Rewriting <a href="#page-11-2">(6)</a>, we get</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(t-1)R_F + R_P \\le C^{-1} \\cdot \\min\\{\\lambda - \\chi C, \\chi(\\log_2(p) - C)\\}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Here, the first argument of the minimum function is indeed maximized for &chi; = 1, but the last argument is maximized for &chi; = t&minus;1 because &lambda;&minus;C is positive for the suggested parameters of Poseidon. Ultimately, security is conjectured if:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(t-1)R_F + R_P \\ge C^{-1} \\cdot \\min\\{\\lambda, \\log_2(p)\\} + t - 2,</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">but if we address the algebra error, we obtain:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(t-1)R_F + R_P \\ge C^{-1} \\cdot \\min\\{\\lambda + C(t-2), \\log_2(p)(t-1)\\}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Previously, the constraint for this kind of Gr&ouml;bner basis attack appeared to be less restrictive than the other attacks, as it was subsumed by the constraints for the other kinds of Gr&ouml;bner basis attacks <a href="#page-18-1">[29,</a> Equation 11]. However, once the error is addressed, this is no longer true. More importantly, there are parameter sets for which this constraint would require the highest number of partial rounds to be secure. For example, for &alpha; = 3, log<sup>2</sup> (p) &asymp; 256, &lambda; = 1536, R<sup>F</sup> = 8, t = 8, an interpolation attack would be thwarted if R<sup>P</sup> &ge; 158, a subspace attack would fail if R<sup>P</sup> &ge; 80, and a full-permutation attack requires R<sup>P</sup> &ge; 73, but a roundlevel Gr&ouml;bner basis attack require R<sup>P</sup> &ge; 230 to achieve required resistance. Therefore, <a href="#page-18-1">[29,</a> Equation. 5] requires three constraints rather than two and this omission does affect the required number of rounds for some parameter sets.</p>

Without loss of generality, we can assume that the last c element of the input state is initialized to 0.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">while it is possible to model Poseidon in various ways using algebraic relations describing them, the model that minimizes the complexity of the Gr&ouml;bner basis attack is the preferred one.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-4.3" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4.3 Complexity of the Attack</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Both Poseidon and Poseidon2 can be modeled as a sequence of polynomials that are not regular. Therefore, the Macaulay bound used in <a href="#page-18-1">[29]</a> is a loose upper bound for the solving degree of the system. In order to extrapolate the solving degree, we run the attack for smaller parameters and derive a formula for the solving degree. We calculated the solving degree for more than 100 different parameter sets of Poseidon and Poseidon2, with state sizes up to five and rate up to four, using different values for &alpha;. Our experiments show that changing the value of &alpha;, does not affect the asymptotic growth of the solving degree when the number of rounds is increased. More precisely, the solving degree grows at the same rate independently of &alpha; in all the cases we analyzed (i.e., the derivative of the solving degree does not change). In addition, the field size seems to have no effect on the value or the growth of solving degrees. In the case of Poseidon2, the solving degree is the same as Poseidon's solving degree when R<sup>F</sup> &gt; 2. Using the collected data, and the conjecture that the solving degree grows linearly as a function of a number of variables, we propose the following heuristic formula for the solving degree.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$d_{sol} = r \\frac{R_F}{2} + 0.8R_P + \\alpha. (7)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Our experiments show that partial rounds do not provide the same level of resistance against algebraic attacks as full rounds and the solving degree growth is a function of the rate instead of the state size.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Table 3.</strong> POSEIDON instances with running time that does not match the expected complexity. The expected running time is computed using the number of basic CPU operations that can be done in 1 second on the host machine.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A similar observation is made in [28] and the authors use  <span class="math">\\omega=1</span>  to ensure a security margin. An explanation for the faster running time is that the F4/F5 algorithms that are commonly used in computing the Gr&ouml;bner basis do not work with the full Macaulay matrix, but rather smaller submatrices that are selected based on ad-hoc criteria. Moreover, the matrices are highly sparse, and therefore the running time of the algorithm is noticeably faster than what the complexity suggests. Therefore, using  <span class="math">\\omega=2</span>  in analyzing the security of the design may lead to an overestimation of the actual resources the attacker requires to break it.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;8</sup> At this point it was killed by the cluster's scheduler.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this paper, we analyzed the security of Poseidon and Poseidon2 which are primitives based on the HADES design strategy. We studied Gr&ouml;bner basis attacks, and showed that partial rounds are not providing the claimed resistance. Using Gr&ouml;bner basis attacks, we break instances of Poseidon and Poseidon2 claiming 1024 bits of security using an attack whose complexity is upper bounded by 2 <sup>731</sup>.<sup>77</sup> and show that the original security argument does not hold for instances with as small as 384 bits of claimed security. Since the vulnerabilities presented in this paper are more pronounced in non-standard security levels we are not aware of any practical instance directly affected. However, we argued that the actual running time of the attack is significantly less than what is suggested by the complexity analysis and hence we encourage the potential users to consider in their risk assessment the ongoing erosion in the security of HADES instances.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Spielman codes <em>[x20]</em> are binary linear-time encodable and decodable linear codes, which are constructed from expander graphs, i.e. bipartite graphs with good vertex expansion properties. Random regular graphs have such properties with high probability and for cryptographic applications it remains to concretely bound this probability as cryptgraphically overwhelming. The work of Sipser and Spielman <em>[x21, x20]</em> is built on lossless expanders, in the sense that sets of size smaller than a given threshold are expanded by at least the half of the vertex degree. Such expansion property yields asymptotic linear complexity, but quite impractical minimum distances and vertex degrees. There is manifold literature improving the distance of expander codes while still being efficiently (e.g. linear-time) encodable and/or decodable. As we are not experts in that field, we refer to <em>[x11, x4]</em> or the manuscript <em>[x12]</em> and the references therein.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The expander code of Golevnev et al. <em>[GLS^{+}21]</em>, in the sequel referred to as the Brakedown code, generalizes the <em>[x20]</em> construction to arbitrary finite fields, while focusing solely on the properties needed in the context of succinct arguments (for NP-complete languages) with a nearly time-optimal prover: Efficient decoding does not play a role in this context, and the alphabet/field size grows naturally with the message size, leading to relaxed asymptotic requirements compared to <em>[x21]</em> and <em>[x20]</em>. Brakedown’s sampling analysis is much more elementary than that of Sipser and Spielman. Their expansion properties leverage the field size and yield significantly better parameters, as long as the underlying field is not too small, or the message size not too large. However, the presentation in <em>[GLS^{+}21]</em> is somewhat hard to comprehend, at least for readers like us, with no solid background in coding theory. For this reason, and in particular for proposing optimized parameters over smaller fields, this write-up is devoted to an extensive description of the Brakedown expander code and its sampling analysis. In particular,</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>we elaborate the convexity argument for general linear bounds (with non-vanishing constant term, as indicated in <em>[GLS^{+}21]</em>), unify the treatment of the expansion bounds for the two types of matrices, and choose tighter tangent bounds. Applied to the example configurations from <em>[GLS^{+}21]</em>, these bounds reduce the overall encoding cost by about 25% and in some cases beyond (see Section 6.1). Furthermore,</li>

      <li>we combine the approach of Spielman <em>[x20]</em> with that of Brakedown in order to obtain linear-time encoding under the stricter assumption of a fixed finite field. While the possibility of such a combination and its asymptotics are probably obvious to the advanced reader, we observe that in practice that combined approach yields better parameters over small fields. Last but not least,</li>

      <li>we give an extensive discussion of the admissible parameter choices. We obtain a general hyperbolic bound on rate-distance pairs <span class="math">(\\rho,\\delta)</span> which is inherent with the recursive construction of expander codes (a bound that is perhaps known to experts), and tight bounds for those <span class="math">(\\rho,\\delta)</span> for which (our variant of) the sampling analysis is applicable (Section 4.4, Theorem 3).</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Eventually, we adapt the <em>[GLS^{+}21]</em> example parameters for the Mersenne prime field with modulus <span class="math">p=2^{31}-1</span>, a candidate field for our next generation proving system Plonky3 <em>[x22]</em>. We plan to publicly share our parameter generation scripts once they are translated to Sage.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let us give a first, rough discussion of the relationship between the parameters <span class="math">\\rho,\\alpha</span> and <span class="math">\\delta</span> imposed by the recursive construction. In order that Condition 2 of Proposition 1 is satisfiable, it is necessary that <span class="math">N_{k+1}-n_{k+1}-N_{k}\\geq\\delta\\cdot(N_{k+1}-N_{k})</span>, which leads to the trivial bound that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\delta+\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}\\cdot\\rho\\leq 1.</span> (1)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Hence for approaching the Singleton bound, one would want to choose the scaling factor <span class="math">\\alpha</span> as small as possible. However, <span class="math">\\alpha</span> is bounded from below by Condition 1, which demands that <span class="math">\\delta\\cdot N_{k+1}\\leq n_{k}</span>, yielding the trivial bound</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\frac{\\delta}{\\rho}\\leq\\alpha.</span> (2)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The two constraints (1) and (2) together imply that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\delta+\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{\\delta}{\\rho}}\\cdot\\rho\\leq\\delta+\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}\\cdot\\rho\\leq 1,</span></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">and hence the hyperbolic inequality</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">\\rho^{2}+\\rho\\cdot\\delta-\\delta^{2}-\\rho+\\delta\\leq 0.</span> (3)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We shall call this inequality the <em>trivial bound</em> on the parameters <span class="math">\\rho</span> and <span class="math">\\delta</span>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The region imposed by the trivial bound (3) is depicted in Figure 1. Its boundary is a hyperbola, which has only one branch within the domain of interest <span class="math">(\\rho,\\delta)\\in[0,1)\\times[0,1)</span>, and this branch goes through the two points <span class="math">(0,0)</span> and <span class="math">(1,0)</span>.

That maximum value has an important implication: There is no expander code with distances larger than <span class="math">\\delta_{max}=0.2</span>. We will see in Section 4.4 that for Brakedown type of expander codes this upper bound is far from being tight.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Given a candidate point <span class="math">(\\rho_{0},\\delta_{0})</span> from below the hyperbola, the range <span class="math">[\\alpha_{min},\\alpha_{max}]</span> of possible <span class="math">\\alpha</span> values is determined as follows.

    <p class="text-gray-300">Taking the tangent instead of the secant for <span class="math">\\ell_{B}(x)</span> leads to a slightly improved bound. See Appendix A for details. The theorem also holds in this case, with (27) replaced by (43), and (29) replaced by (44).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">under the assumption of a sufficiently smooth multiplicative group. Given the quite large field size, multiplications clearly dominate additions, and we estimate that the high-throughput configuration (i.e. the first row in Table 1) about twice as fast for message size  <span class="math">n = 2^{20}</span> , approaching a speedup factor of 3 at message size  <span class="math">n = 2^{30}</span> . The large-distance configuration instead (the last row in Table 1) is about 2 times slower than the fast configuration, still leading to a significant advantage over Reed-Solomon.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As a first set of examples we adapt the  <span class="math">(\\rho, \\delta)</span> -configurations from Table 1 to the Mersenne field with prime modulus  <span class="math">p = 2^{31} - 1</span> . Due to the smaller field size, we obtain an about  <span class="math">30\\%</span>  increase in the number of field operations, see Table 2. Using solely the Brakedown strategy, we observe a significant increase of the  <span class="math">c_{n}</span>  beyond  <span class="math">n = 2^{25} - 2^{27}</span> , letting us decide for  <span class="math">2^{25}</span>  as the maximum message size. For message size  <span class="math">n = 25</span>  the approximate overall costs are now about the half (for the high-throughput configuration) and about the same (for the large-distance configuration) of that of Reed-Solomon encoding at rate  <span class="math">\\frac{1}{2}</span> . When combining with the Spielman approach, see Table 3, we are able to extend the parameters to larger message sizes, and for the larger distance configurations we even obtain better results below  <span class="math">2^{25}</span> . Two further large distance configurations, for  <span class="math">\\delta = 0.08</span>  and  <span class="math">\\delta = 0.09</span> , are given in Table 4.</p>

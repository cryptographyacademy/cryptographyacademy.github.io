    <p class="text-gray-300">Groups of hidden order have gained a surging interest in recent years due to applications to cryptographic commitments, verifiable delay functions and zero knowledge proofs. Recently ([DG20]), the Jacobian of a genus three hyperelliptic curve has been suggested as a suitable candidate for such a group. While this looks like a promising idea, certain Jacobians are less secure than others and hence, the curve has to be chosen with caution. In this short note, we explore the types of Jacobians that would be suitable for this purpose.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-3" class="text-2xl font-bold">1 Introduction</h2>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Finite abelian groups of hidden order have gained prominence within cryptography in the last few years. The adaptive root assumption in such groups yields a cryptographic accumulator which is universal and dynamic with batchable membership and non-membership proofs. A lot of these techniques were developed in [BBF19] where the authors constructed the first known Vector Commitment with constant-sized openings and a constant-sized public parameter. They subsequently designed a stateless blockchain that hinges on this Vector Commitment. One of the best known verifiable delay functions is that constructed in [Wes18] which can be instantiated with any group of unknown order. Such groups also form the basis for the transparent polynomial commitment constructed in [BFS19]. This is a polynomial commitment with logarithmic sized proofs and verification time and can also be instantiated with any group of hidden order.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Until recently, the only widely known examples of groups of unknown order were RSA groups (which require a trusted setup) and class groups of number fields. In the latter case, only imaginary quadratic fields allow for efficient operations within class groups and even for this case, the group operations are roughly 10 times slower than those for RSA groups with the same security level. The recent paper by Dobson and Galbraith ([DG20] astutely observed that Jacobians of smooth curves over finite fields and in particular, Jacobians of genus three hyperelliptic curves can yield suitable candidates for groups of unknown order. These groups have a transparent setup unlike RSA groups and the group operations are believed to be 28 times faster than those in class groups of imaginary quadratic fields for the same level of security.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this short note, we address a few issues surrounding the choice of the hyperelliptic curve. Broadly, it appears that the curves with the most "generic" behavior might be more suitable for our purpose since such curves do not appear to be vulnerable to the various point-counting algorithms than exist for certain families of curves.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 2.1.</strong> An abelian variety A over a field F is <em>simple</em> if it does not contain a strict non-zero abelian subvariety. We say A is <em>absolutely</em> or <em>geometrically</em> simple if the base change  <span class="math">A \\times_F \\overline{F}</span>  to the algebraic closure is simple. An abelian variety A is <em>iso-simple</em> if it has a unique simple abelian subvariety up to isogeny.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We now state a few well-known facts about abelian varieties over finite fields which we will need in the subsequent sections. We refer the reader to the notes [Oo95] for proofs and further details.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Proposition 2.1.</strong> For any simple abelian variety B over a finite field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> , the abelian variety  <span class="math">B \\times_{\\mathbb{F}_q} \\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_q</span>  is iso-simple.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With this setup, let  <span class="math">\\pi</span>  be a Weil number corresponding to B and let  <span class="math">\\widetilde{B}</span>  be the unique simple component (up to isogeny) of the base change  <span class="math">B \\times_{\\mathbb{F}_q} \\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_q</span>  to the algebraic closure. Let N be the smallest integer such that  <span class="math">\\widetilde{B}</span>  has a model over the field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{q^N}</span> . Then  <span class="math">\\widetilde{B}</span>  corresponds to the Weil number  <span class="math">\\pi^N</span>  and we have an isogeny</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">B \\times_{\\mathbb{F}_q} \\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_q =_{\\mathrm{isog}} \\widetilde{B}^{(\\dim B)/N}.</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Proposition 2.2.</strong> Let  <span class="math">\\pi</span>  be a Weil q-integer and let  <span class="math">B_{\\pi}</span>  be the corresponding simple abelian variety over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> . The following are equivalent:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let B be an abelian variety over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p > 0. The group scheme  <span class="math">B[p^{\\infty}]</span>  is a p-divisible group of rank  <span class="math">\\leq \\dim B</span> . Let  <span class="math">D(B[p^{\\infty}])</span>  denote the Dieudonne module and W(k) the Witt ring of k. Then  <span class="math">D(B[p^{\\infty}]) \\otimes_k W(k)[\\frac{1}{p}]</span>  is a direct sum of pure isocrystals by the Dieudonne-Manin classification theorem. Let  <span class="math">\\lambda_1 &lt; \\cdots &lt; \\lambda_r</span>  be the distinct slopes and let  <span class="math">m_i</span>  denote the multiplicity of  <span class="math">\\lambda_i</span> . The sequence  <span class="math">m_1 \\times \\lambda_1, \\cdots, m_r \\times \\lambda_r</span>  is called the Newton polygon of B. For a curve C over a field of positive characteristic, we refer to the Newton polygon of the Jacobian  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Jac}(C)</span>  as the Newton polygon of C.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 2.3.</strong> A Newton polygon is <em>admissible</em> if it fulfills the following conditions:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>1. The breakpoints are integral, meaning that for any slope  <span class="math">\\lambda</span>  of multiplicity  <span class="math">m_{\\lambda}</span> , we have  <span class="math">m_{\\lambda}\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{Z}</span> .</li>

      <li>2. The polygon is <em>symmetric</em>, meaning that each slope  <span class="math">\\lambda</span> , the slopes  <span class="math">\\lambda</span>  and  <span class="math">1 \\lambda</span>  have the same multiplicity.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">\\pi</span>  be a Weil q-integer and let  <span class="math">B_{\\pi}</span>  be the corresponding simple abelian variety over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> . Then the Newton slopes of  <span class="math">B_{\\pi}</span>  are given by  <span class="math">\\{v(\\pi)/v(q)\\}_v</span>  where v runs through the places of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(\\pi)</span>  lying over p. In particular, the Newton polygon is symmetric and hence, all slopes lie in the interval [0,1]. The multiplicity of the slope 0 is called the p-rank of  <span class="math">B_{\\pi}</span> . This is the  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> -rank of the p-torsion group scheme  <span class="math">B_{\\pi}[p]</span></p>

    <h4 id="sec-7" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">2.3 <em>l</em>-adic Galois representations</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let A be an abelian variety over a field F.

    <p class="text-gray-300">module of A. The Zariski closure  <span class="math">G_{A,l}</span>  of the image of  <span class="math">\\rho_{A,l}</span>  is called the l-adic monodromy group of A. Let  <span class="math">G_{A,l}^0</span>  denote the connected component of  <span class="math">G_{A,l}</span>  containing the identity. This is a connected reductive subgroup (Falting's theorem) of the general symplectic group  <span class="math">\\mathrm{GSp}_{2g}</span> . The index of  <span class="math">G_{A,l}^0</span>  in  <span class="math">G_{A,l}</span>  is finite and independent of the prime l. So after base change to a suitable extension  <span class="math">F_{A,\\mathrm{conn}}</span> , the groups  <span class="math">G_{A,l}</span>  are connected reductive groups.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-8" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">2.4 Cryptographic assumptions</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 2.4.</strong> We say that the <strong>adaptive root assumption</strong> holds for a group  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}</span>  if there is no efficient probabilistic polynomial time (PPT) adversary  <span class="math">(A_0, A_1)</span>  that succeeds in the following task.  <span class="math">A_0</span>  outputs a an element  <span class="math">w \\in \\mathbb{G}</span>  and some state. Then a random prime l is chosen and  <span class="math">A_1(l, \\text{state})</span>  outputs  <span class="math">w^{1/l} \\in \\mathbb{G}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Unlike in the case of class groups, it is possible to compute elements of small orders in Jacobians. But this can be remedied by replacing the Jacobian by an appropriate subgroup.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Assumption 2.5.</strong> For a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 or 3 over a finite field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  for a sufficiently large p, we assume there exists an  <span class="math">N \\in \\mathbb{Z}</span>  such that it is infeasible for a probabilistic polynomial time algorithm to compute roots of the l-th division polynomials for l > N.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For such an integer N, let  <span class="math">n := \\text{lcm}(1, \\dots, N)</span> . The subgroup [n] Jac(C) of Jac(C) is then expected to fulfill the adaptive root assumption. According to [DG20], the smooth integer  <span class="math">n := \\text{lcm}(1, \\dots, 60)</span>  is sufficient when C is a genus three hyperelliptic curve.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 2.5.</strong>  <span class="math">\\mathbb{G}</span>  satisfies the <strong>strong-RSA</strong> assumption if no PPT adversary  <span class="math">\\mathcal{A}</span>  is able to compute (except with negligible probability) the l-th root of a chosen element  <span class="math">w \\in \\mathbb{G}</span>  for some randomly chosen prime l.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The Jacobian Jac(C) of a genus three hyperelliptic curve is believed to fulfill the strong RSA assumption without having to be replaced by a suitable subgroup [n] Jac(C). In particular, we note that the transparent DARK polynomial commitment scheme ([BFS19]) has been proven to be secure under the strong RSA assumption even if the adaptive root assumption fails for the underlying group of hidden order. Thus, these Jacobians seem to be well suited for this polynomial commitment scheme and the associated (transparent) SNARK.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-9" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">3 Jacobians of curves</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For a field F of characteristic other than 2, a hyperelliptic curve C of genus g is the smooth completion of the affine curve given by  <span class="math">Y^2 = f(X)</span>  with f monic, separable of degree 2g + 1. A divisor D is a formal sum  <span class="math">\\sum_{m_P \\in \\mathbb{Z}, P \\in C} m_P[P]</span>  of points on C with all but finitely many of the multiplicities  <span class="math">m_P</span>  zero.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The degree  <span class="math">\\deg(D)</span>  is the sum  <span class="math">\\sum_P m_P</span> . The degree zero divisors  <span class="math">\\mathrm{Div}^0(C)</span>  form an abelian group under addition. The principal divisors  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}(C)</span>  of C are the divisors of the form  <span class="math">(f) := \\mathrm{ord}_P(f)[P]</span>  where  <span class="math">f \\in \\overline{F}(C)</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathrm{ord}_P(f)</span>  is the order of the zero or the pole of F at P. The quotient  <span class="math">\\mathrm{Jac}(C) := \\mathrm{Div}^0(C)/\\mathcal{P}(C)</span>  is called the  <span class="math">\\mathrm{Jacobian}</span>  of C. This is endowed with the structure of a principally polarized abelian variety over the field F.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Ever principally polarized abelian variety of dimension up to three is the Jacobian of some smooth curve ([OU73], Theorem 4). On the other hand, for genus larger than three, Jacobians are rare in the class of principally polarized abelian varieties, which means abelian varieties of</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">genus four and higher are less promising for cryptographic purposes. In genus two, every smooth projective curve is hyperelliptic. On the other hand, the hyperelliptic locus of genus three curves is of codimension 1, which means almost all genus three curves are non-hyperelliptic. Since Jacobians of genus three non-hyperelliptic curves are far less secure, it is important to be careful with the choice of the curve. When it comes to candidates for groups of hidden order, we would ideally have genus three hyperelliptic curves C over finite fields  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  such that  <span class="math">\\mathrm{Jac}(C)</span>  is an absolutely simple threefold with a commutative endomorphism algebra.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The following example demonstrates that certain Jacobians yield insecure groups of hidden order. The structure of the Jacobian over the field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  is, in this case, determined by a congruence condition on the prime. So although it is ill-suited for the goal of constructing hidden order groups, it give us some insights into the families of Jacobians we must avoid.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Example.</strong> Let l be an odd prime. Consider the curve</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">induces an embedding</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_l) \\hookrightarrow \\operatorname{End}^0(\\operatorname{Jac}(C) \\times_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_l)).</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">[\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_l):\\mathbb{Q}] = l - 1 = 2\\dim \\operatorname{Jac}(C),</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">it follows (by degree reasons) that Jac(C) is absolutely simple with CM by the field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_l)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Now,  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Jac}(C)</span>  has good reduction away from  <span class="math">\\{2,l\\}</span>  and since it is an abelian variety with CM, it has potential good reduction everywhere. So, for any prime  <span class="math">p \\neq 2, l</span> , the reduction  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Jac}(C)_p</span>  is an abelian variety over the finite field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> . Furthermore, since the extension  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_l)/\\mathbb{Q}</span>  is abelian, it follows from the theory of complex multiplication that the Newton slopes of  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Jac}(C)_p</span>  are determined exclusively by the splitting of the prime p in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta_l]</span> , which is determined by the residue  <span class="math">p \\pmod{l}</span> .</p>

      <li>1. In particular, if  <span class="math">p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{l}</span> ,  <span class="math">Jac(C_p)</span>  is ordinary.</li>

In particular, if q is not a prime, we would have the added burden of making sure that  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Jac}(C)</span>  does not have a model over any proper subfield of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Although such a Jacobian is absolutely simple, after passing to a suitable finite extension (of degree at most 6), the number of points is the cube of an integer. This would necessitate a larger field of definition for the same security level.</p>

While this construction is certainly useful for other purposes, it is clearly insecure for the purpose of producing groups of hidden order.

Such Jacobians are susceptible to the point-counting technique in [Abe18].

Since every abelian extension over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}</span>  is a subfield of some cyclotomic field (Kronecker-Weber), it seems feasible that the technique could be extended in the foreseeable future to Jacobians with real multiplication (RM) by any known totally real cubic field Galois over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}</span> . For this reason, when it comes to constructing Jacobians with a hidden number of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> -points, it might be prudent to avoid Jacobians with RM by such fields.</p>

    <h4 id="sec-14" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">3.4 Reductions of generic Jacobians over <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}</span></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we explore the types of curves that might be suitable for constructing Jacobians with a hidden number of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> -rational points. Since we are interested in hyperelliptic curves over a prime field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> , a natural place to look is the reductions of hyperelliptic curves over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}</span>  at the places of good reduction.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">By a generic CM field, we mean a CM field of degree g whose Galois closure over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}</span>  is of degree  <span class="math">2^g g!</span> . Similarly, we say a totally real field of degree g is generic if its Galois closure is of degree g!. While most simple abelian varieties of dimension g over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  have CM by some CM field of degree 2g, we will show in this section that the curve can be chosen so that with overwhelming probability, the endomorphism algebra of a Jacobian is a generic CM field.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">First, we note that if a curve C over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}</span>  is such that  <span class="math">L \\hookrightarrow \\operatorname{End}^0(\\operatorname{Jac}(C))</span>  for some number field L, then we have  <span class="math">L \\hookrightarrow \\operatorname{End}^0(\\operatorname{Jac}(C_p))</span>  for any prime p of good reduction. Since the knowledge of the endomorphism algebra of  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Jac}(C_p)</span>  makes point-counting algorithms more feasible, it seems more prudent to look for Jacobians over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}</span>  that have no endomorphisms other than those of the form</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">[N]: \\operatorname{Jac}(C) \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{Jac}(C); \\ P \\longrightarrow [N]P \\ (N \\in \\mathbb{Z}).</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We recall a few relevant theorems here.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 3.6.</strong> (Zarhin) Let  <span class="math">C: Y^2 = f(X)</span>  be a genus g hyperelliptic curve over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}</span>  such that the Galois group of f(X) is the symmetric group  <span class="math">S_{2g+1}</span>  or the alternating group  <span class="math">A_{2g+1}</span> . Then Jac(C) is an absolutely simple abelian variety over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}</span>  with  <span class="math">End_{\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}}(Jac(C)) = \\mathbb{Z}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We refer the reader to [Zha00] for the proof. Recall that as a consequence of Hilbert's irreducibility theorem, most polynomials of degree N are irreducible with Galois group  <span class="math">S_N</span> . So the condition imposed on f(X) is not particularly restrictive.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 3.7.</strong> (Serre's open image theorem) Let g be an odd integer or 2 or 6. Let A be an abelian variety over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}</span>  with absolute endomorphism ring  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}</span> . Then for any prime l, the image of the Galois representation  <span class="math">\\rho_{A,l}: \\operatorname{Gal}_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\longrightarrow \\operatorname{GSp}_{2g}(\\mathbb{Z}_l)</span>  is open of finite index in  <span class="math">\\operatorname{GSp}_{2g}(\\mathbb{Z}_l)</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This is a generalization of Serre's older and better-known open image theorem for elliptic curves. Chavdarov ([Cha97]) showed that when the l-adic monodromy groups are as large as possible, the reductions are almost always geometrically simple abelian varieties over finite fields. In fact, the statement of his theorem is a bit more precise.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Theorem 3.8.</strong> (Chavdarov) Let A be an abelian variety over a number field F with absolute endomorphism ring  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}</span>  and with l-adic mondomy group  <span class="math">\\operatorname{GSp}_{2g,\\mathbb{Q}_l}</span>  for any prime l. Suppose, furthermore, that F is enlarged so that the l-adic monodromy groups  <span class="math">G_{A,l}</span>  are connected. Then, away from a set of primes of F of Dirichlet density zero, the reduction  <span class="math">A_v</span>  at a prime v is an absolutely simple abelian variety with  <span class="math">\\operatorname{End}^0(A_v)</span>  a generic CM field of degree 2g.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Zywina ([Zyw14]) generalized Chavdarov's theorem to all abelian varieties fulfilling the Mumford-Tate conjecture. The smallest field extension  <span class="math">F_{A,\\text{conn}}</span>  such that the l-adic modoromy groups are connected can be alternatively describes as</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">F_{A,\\mathrm{conn}} := \\bigcap_{l} F(A[l^{\\infty}])</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">F(A[l^{\\infty}])</span>  is the extension of F obtained by attaching all  <span class="math">l^N</span> -torsion points of A (for every  <span class="math">N \\in \\mathbb{Z}</span> ) and the intersection runs through all rational primes ([LP95]). So, choosing a curve C</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}</span>  such that the field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}_{\\text{Jac}(C),\\text{conn}} = \\mathbb{Q}</span>  would allow us to choose a place v of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}_{\\text{Jac}(C),\\text{conn}}</span>  such that:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>1. v is of local degree on over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}</span> , meaning that the residue field  <span class="math">k_v</span>  is a field of size  <span class="math">p := \\operatorname{char}(v)</span> .</li>

      <li>2.  <span class="math">C \\times_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\mathbb{Q}_{\\text{Jac}(C),\\text{conn}}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\text{Jac}(C) \\times_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\mathbb{Q}_{\\text{Jac}(C),\\text{conn}}</span>  have good reduction at v. Note that away from a finite set of places, both the curve C and the Jacobian Jac(C) will have good reduction.</li>

      <li>3.  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Jac}(C_v)</span>  is absolutely simple with  <span class="math">\\operatorname{End}^0(\\operatorname{Jac}(C_v))</span>  a generic CM field of degree 2g. The ubiquitousness of such places v is implied by the aforementioned theorems of Chavdarov.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The first condition ensures that the field of definition is a prime finite field and the second ensures that  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Jac}(C_v)</span>  is the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve. The third condition ensures that  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Jac}(C_v)</span>  does not have RM by any totally real field of degree g which is Galois over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}</span> . This is one way of making sure that the adaptive root assumption in the group  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Jac}(C_v(\\mathbb{F}_p))</span>  is not vulnerable to an attack using Abelard's techniques ([Abe18]). In particular, with this construction,  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Jac}(C_v)</span>  would not have RM by any totally real field of degree g which is Galois over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Corollary 3.9.</strong> For an odd integer g and a number fielf F, let  <span class="math">f(X) \\in \\mathcal{O}_F[X]</span>  be an irreducible polynomial of degree 2g+1 with Galois group  <span class="math">S_{2g+1}</span> . Let  <span class="math">C:Y^2=f(X)</span>  be the hyperelliptic curve over F with Jacobian Jac(C). Then there exists a density one subset S of the primes of F such that for any  <span class="math">v \\in S</span> :</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>the residue field  <span class="math">k_v</span>  at v is a prime field.</li>

      <li>the reduction  <span class="math">C_v</span>  is a smooth curve over  <span class="math">k_v</span> .</li>

      <li>the Jacobian  <span class="math">Jac(C_v)</span>  is an absolutely simple abelian variety over  <span class="math">k_v</span>  with CM by a generic CM field of degree 2g.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof.</em> Since the intersection of two sets of Dirichlet density one also has density one, it suffices to show that the sets of primes of F fulfilling each of the three conditions have density one.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that any prime v with local degree one over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}</span>  fulfills the first condition and by the Chebotarev density theorem, the Dirichlet density of such primes is one. Since the curve  <span class="math">C \\times_{\\mathbb{Q}} L</span>  has good reduction away from a finite set of primes, the second condition holds away from a set of density zero.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since the Galois group of f(X) is assumed to be the full symmetric group  <span class="math">S_{2g+1}</span> , Zarhin's theorem implies that the endomorphism ring  <span class="math">\\operatorname{End}(\\operatorname{Jac}(C))</span>  is trivial. Furthermore, by Chavdarov's theorem, away from a density zero set,  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Jac}(C_v)</span>  is absolutely simple with  <span class="math">\\operatorname{End}(\\operatorname{Jac}(C_v))</span>  a generic CM field of degree 2g, which completes the proof.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Furthermore, the following proposition implies that for any fixed number field  <span class="math">L \\neq \\mathbb{Q}</span> , the reduction of the Jacobian at a randomly chosen prime is unlikely to have action by L.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Proposition 3.10.</strong> For an odd integer g, let  <span class="math">C: Y^2 = f(X)</span>  be a hyperelliptic curve such that  <span class="math">f(X) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[X]</span>  is irreducible of degree 2g + 1 with Galois group  <span class="math">S_{2g+1}</span> . Let L be any fixed number field other than  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}</span> . Then away from a set of places of density zero, the Jacobian of the reduction  <span class="math">C_v</span>  does not have action by the field L.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><em>Proof.</em> Let  <span class="math">\\widetilde{L}</span>  denote the Galois closure of L over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}</span> . By Zarhin's theorem,  <span class="math">A:=\\operatorname{Jac}(C)</span>  is absolutely simple of dimension three with absolute endomorphism ring  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Z}</span> . So A fulfills the Mumford-Tate conjecture and its Mumford-Tate group is the general symplectic group  <span class="math">\\operatorname{GSp}_{2g}</span> . It is well-known that the general symplectic group is split over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}</span> , i.e. it has a maximal split torus over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{Q}</span> . Furthermore, the Weyl group  <span class="math">W(\\operatorname{GSp}_{2g})</span>  of  <span class="math">\\operatorname{GSp}_{2g}</span>  is the wreath product  <span class="math">\\{\\pm 1\\}^g \\rtimes S_g</span> . Hence, by ([Zyw14], Thm 1.5), there exists a density one subset  <span class="math">\\mathcal{S}</span>  of  <span class="math">\\Sigma_F</span>  such that</p>

    <div class="my-4 text-center"><span class="math-block">\\operatorname{Gal}(\\widetilde{L}(\\mathcal{W}_{A_v})/\\widetilde{L}) \\cong W(\\operatorname{GSp}_{2g}) \\cong \\{\\pm 1\\}^g \\rtimes S_g, \\ \\forall \\ v \\in \\mathcal{S}.</span></div>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In particular, for any v ∈ S, we the endomorphism algebra End<sup>0</sup> (Av) is linearly disjoint with L.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Now, for an odd integer g, let f(X) ∈ Z[X] be any irreducible polynomial with Galois group S2g+1. Let C : Y <sup>2</sup> = f(X) be the hyperelliptic curve over Q and A := Jac(C) its Jacobian. Then A has absolute endomorphism ring Z and if p is a randomly chosen rational prime of good reduction, then with overwhelming probability:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <li>the Jacobian A<sup>p</sup> = Jac(Cp) is absolutely simple with End<sup>0</sup> (B) a generic CM field of degree 2g.</li>

      <li>A<sup>p</sup> does not have action by any fixed number field other than Q.</li>

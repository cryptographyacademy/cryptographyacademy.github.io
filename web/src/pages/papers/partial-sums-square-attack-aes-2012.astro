      <p class="text-gray-300">
        The Square attack as a means of attacking reduced round
        variants of AES was described in the initial description of
        the Rijndael block cipher. This attack can be applied to AES,
        with a relatively small number of chosen plaintext-ciphertext
        pairs, reduced to less than six rounds in the case of AES-128
        and seven rounds otherwise and several extensions to this
        attack have been described in the literature. In this paper we
        describe new variants of these attacks that have a smaller
        time complexity than those present in the literature.
        Specifically, we demonstrate that the quantity of chosen
        plaintext-ciphertext pairs can be halved producing the same
        reduction in the time complexity. We also demonstrate that the
        time complexity can be halved again for attacks applied to
        AES-128 and reduced by a smaller factor for attacks applied to
        AES-192. This is achieved by eliminating hypotheses on-the-fly
        when bytes in consecutive subkeys are related because of the
        key schedule.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">1. Introduction</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) <a href="#ref-FIPS01">[FIPS01]</a> was standardized
        in 2001 from a proposal by Daemen and Rijmen <a href="#ref-DaeRij98">[DaeRij98]</a>. It has since
        been analyzed with regard to numerous attacks ranging from
        purely theoretical cryptanalysis to attacks that require some
        extra information, e.g. from some side channel <a href="#ref-ManOswPop07">[ManOswPop07]</a>, to
        succeed.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        In Daemen and Rijmen&rsquo;s AES proposal an attack is
        described that is referred to as the Square attack <a href="#ref-DaeRij98">[DaeRij98]</a>. This
        attack was so-called since it was first presented in the
        description of the block cipher Square <a href="#ref-DaeKnuRij97">[DaeKnuRij97]</a>. The Square attack
        is based on a particular property arising from the structure
        of AES. That is, for a set of 256 plaintexts where each byte
        at an arbitrary index is a distinct value and all the other
        bytes are equal, the XOR sum of the 256 intermediate states
        after three rounds of AES will be zero.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        Some optimizations to this attack have been proposed in the
        literature. Ferguson et al. proposed a way of conducting the
        Square attack referred to as the &ldquo;partial sums&rdquo;
        method <a href="#ref-Fer+01">[Fer+01]</a>. This allowed the Square attack to be conducted
        with a relatively low time complexity for reduced round
        variants of AES. The time complexity of these attacks was
        further reduced following an observation made by Lucks. He
        noted that given a known last subkey in AES-192 then
        information on previous subkeys can be derived.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        In this paper we describe how the attacks proposed by Ferguson
        et al. and Lucks can be improved. Specifically, we show that
        the number of chosen plaintext-ciphertext pairs required to
        conduct the Square attack can be halved and therefore halve
        the time complexity of the attack. Moreover, we demonstrate
        that the time complexity of the Square attack can be halved
        again when applied to AES-128, and reduced to a lesser extent
        for AES-192, by exploiting relationships between key bytes as
        they are derived. In this paper we restrict ourselves to
        attacks that require a relatively small number of chosen
        plaintext-ciphertext pairs. The attacks proposed by Ferguson
        et al., based on the Square attack, that require around
        <span class="math">2^&#123;128&#125;</span> chosen
        plaintext-ciphertext pairs are beyond the scope of this
        paper <a href="#ref-Fer+01">[Fer+01]</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we define the
        notation we use to describe AES. In Section 3 we describe the
        property that the Square attack is based on. In Section 4 we
        describe how the Square attack can be applied to AES-128, and
        in Section 5 we describe how the Square can be applied to
        AES-192 and AES-256. We summarize our contribution and
        conclude in Section 6.

        In this paper, multiplications in
        <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;2^8&#125;</span>
        are considered to be polynomial multiplications modulo the

        2.1 The Advanced Encryption Standard
      </h3>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        The structure of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), as
        used to perform encryption, is illustrated in Algorithm 1. In
        discussing the AES we consider that all intermediate variables
        of the encryption operation variables are arranged in a
        <span class="math">4 \times 4</span> array of bytes, referred
        to as the state matrix. For example, the 128-bit plaintext
        <span class="math">P = (p_1, p_2, \dots, p_&#123;16&#125;)</span>,
        where each
        <span class="math">p_i \in \&#123;1, \dots, 16\&#125;</span>
        is one byte, is arranged as:
      </p>

      <div class="math-block">
        \begin&#123;pmatrix&#125;
        p_1 &amp; p_5 &amp; p_9 &amp; p_&#123;13&#125; \\
        p_2 &amp; p_6 &amp; p_&#123;10&#125; &amp; p_&#123;14&#125; \\
        p_3 &amp; p_7 &amp; p_&#123;11&#125; &amp; p_&#123;15&#125; \\
        p_4 &amp; p_8 &amp; p_&#123;12&#125; &amp; p_&#123;16&#125;
        \end&#123;pmatrix&#125;
      </div>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        The encryption itself is conducted by the repeated use of a
        round function that comprises the following operations
        executed in sequence:
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        The <strong>AddRoundKey</strong> operation XORs each byte of
        the array with a byte from a corresponding subkey. In each
        instance of the AddRoundKey a fresh 16-byte subkey is used
        from the subkey bytes generated by the key schedule.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        The <strong>SubBytes</strong> operation is the only nonlinear
        step of the block cipher, consisting of a substitution table
        applied to each byte of the state. This replaces each byte of
        the state matrix by its multiplicative inverse, followed by an
        affine mapping. In the remainder of this paper we will refer
        to the function <span class="math">S</span> as this
        substitution table and
        <span class="math">S^&#123;-1&#125;</span> as its inverse.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        The <strong>ShiftRows</strong> operation is a byte-wise
        permutation of the state that operates on each row.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        The <strong>MixColumns</strong> operation operates on the
        state column by column. Each column of the state matrix is
        considered as a vector where each of its four elements belong
        to
        <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;2^8&#125;</span>.
        A <span class="math">4 \times 4</span> matrix
        <span class="math">M</span> whose elements are also in
        <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;2^8&#125;</span>
        is used to map this column into a new vector. Here
        <span class="math">M</span> and its inverse
        <span class="math">M^&#123;-1&#125;</span> are defined as:
      </p>

      <div class="math-block">
        M = \begin&#123;pmatrix&#125;
        2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
        1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \\
        1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
        3 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
        \end&#123;pmatrix&#125;
        \quad \text&#123;and&#125; \quad
        M^&#123;-1&#125; = \begin&#123;pmatrix&#125;
        14 &amp; 11 &amp; 13 &amp; 9 \\
        9 &amp; 14 &amp; 11 &amp; 13 \\
        13 &amp; 9 &amp; 14 &amp; 11 \\
        11 &amp; 13 &amp; 9 &amp; 14
        \end&#123;pmatrix&#125;
      </div>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        All the elements in <span class="math">M</span> and
        <span class="math">M^&#123;-1&#125;</span> are elements of
        <span class="math">\mathbb&#123;F&#125;_&#123;2^8&#125;</span>
        expressed in decimal.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        In Algorithm 1 we can see that the last round does not include
        the execution of a MixColumns operation. In all the attacks
        considered in this paper we will assume that the last round
        does not include a MixColumns operation. This is important to
        note since it has been shown that the presence of a MixColumns
        operation in the last round would affect the security of
        AES <a href="#ref-DunKel10">[DunKel10]</a>.
      </p>

      <!-- 2.2 The Key Schedule -->

      <h3 id="sec-2.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">
        2.2 The Key Schedule
      </h3>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        The key schedule generates a series of subkeys from the secret
        key. There are three variants of the AES corresponding to the
        three possible bit lengths of the secret key used, i.e. 128,
        192 or 256 bits. The function
        <span class="math">S</span> is the substitution function used
        in the SubBytes operation described above. The function
        <span class="math">f</span> is, for the most part, the
        identity function. However, when
        <span class="math">K</span> is a 256-bit key and
        <span class="math">f</span> is the substitution function,
        <span class="math">f</span> is a round constant that changes
        for each loop.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        For AES-128, knowing one subkey will allow the original key to
        be derived. For AES-192 and AES-256 there will still be some
        ambiguity and two subkeys are required to derive the original
        key.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">3. The Square Attack</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        If we consider two plaintexts that have a XOR difference that
        is non-zero in one byte, then this difference will expand in a
        known manner. After one round the XOR difference between the
        intermediate states would show that one column of the state
        matrix has a non-zero difference. This property will then
        propagate to all the bytes in the state matrix after the
        second round by the same reasoning.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        It is therefore impossible that the XOR difference between two
        such plaintexts will be zero in any byte after two rounds.
        This property will persist until the next MixColumns
        operation, and is used for impossible differential
        cryptanalysis since the XOR difference after two rounds cannot
        be zero <a href="#ref-BihKel99">[BihKel99]</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        This property is also used to construct the Square attack
        (so-called since it was first presented in the description of
        the block cipher Square <a href="#ref-DaeKnuRij97">[DaeKnuRij97]</a>) and was first presented in the
        original description of AES <a href="#ref-DaeRij98">[DaeRij98]</a>. We consider 256 distinct
        plaintexts that are equal in fifteen bytes. After computing
        two rounds of AES the property described above will be valid
        between all possible pairs, i.e. across all 256 intermediate
        states the bytes at each index will contain one of each
        possible value. The XOR sum of the 256 bytes at each index
        will therefore be equal to zero. There will not be one
        instance of each possible value across the 256 bytes at each
        index after the next MixColumns operation. However, the XOR
        sum of the bytes at each index will still be zero after the
        MixColumns operation, and this property will remain true until
        the next SubBytes operation. In the remainder of this paper we
        will refer to a set of 256 chosen plaintext-ciphertext pairs
        where the 256 distinct plaintexts are equal in fifteen bytes
        as a <span class="math">\delta</span>-set.

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        An attack based on the property described in Section 3 was
        originally detailed by Daemen and Rijmen in their AES
        proposal <a href="#ref-DaeRij98">[DaeRij98]</a>. If we consider one
        <span class="math">\delta</span>-set, the XOR sum of the
        intermediate states at the end of the third round is equal to
        zero. For a four-round variant of AES an attacker can use this
        observation to validate hypotheses on the last subkey
        byte-by-byte, where an attacker checks that the XOR sum of
        the input to the final round is equal to zero. For each byte
        this will return the correct subkey byte and one additional
        incorrect hypothesis per byte with a probability of 255/256.
        That is, any random sequence of bytes will have an XOR sum
        equal to zero with a probability of
        <span class="math">1/256</span> and there are 255 such
        sequences. This will result in an expected total number of key
        hypotheses for the last subkey of
        <span class="math">\left(1 + \frac&#123;255&#125;&#123;256&#125;\right)^&#123;16&#125; \approx 2^&#123;16&#125;</span>,
        since the length of the lists of hypotheses are mutually
        independent. One can determine the key if one repeats the
        analysis, i.e. one takes
        <span class="math">2^9</span> chosen plaintexts and conducts
        the above analysis twice. This would have a time complexity of
        <span class="math">2^9</span> one-round decryptions

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        An extension to the above attack was also first presented in
        the original description of AES <a href="#ref-DaeRij98">[DaeRij98]</a>. This attack allowed an
        extra round to be analyzed with an increase in the time
        complexity. Rather than analyzing the final subkey
        byte-by-byte, one analyzes the penultimate subkey.

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        In order to do this one is obliged to guess 32 bits of the
        final subkey to determine one column of the state matrix
        before the XOR with the penultimate subkey. One can then
        compute the MixColumns operation on this column, and validate
        hypotheses on a byte of a subkey equivalent to the penultimate
        subkey. Each evaluation reduces the potential key space of
        five bytes being analyzed by a factor of 256, and one would
        need to conduct this analysis five times to determine 32 bits
        of the final subkey <a href="#ref-DaeRij98">[DaeRij98]</a>.

        In order to conduct an attack one can compute
        <span class="math">(x_1, c_2, c_3)</span> for all the
        ciphertexts in a <span class="math">\delta</span>-set for all
        possible values of <span class="math">k_0</span> and

        <span class="math">S</span> <a href="#ref-Fer+01">[Fer+01]</a>, implementing the attack

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        The analysis of the hypotheses can be further optimized if the
        relationship between the last and penultimate subkey are
        verified as the attack progresses. If we consider one
        <span class="math">\delta</span>-set, one can analyze two
        columns of the penultimate subkey by guessing eight bytes of
        the last subkey (in two sets of four bytes). This will produce
        two sets of <span class="math">2^&#123;32&#125;</span>
        hypotheses with a time complexity equivalent to
        <span class="math">2^&#123;36&#125;</span> five-round AES
        encryption operations. One can then eliminate hypotheses in
        each set that are inconsistent, given that we have hypotheses
        on eight bytes of the penultimate key and eight bytes of the
        last subkey.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        From the AES key schedule we can see that any subkey byte can
        be computed from two specific bytes in either the previous or
        following subkey. From the two sets of hypotheses generated,
        there will be three cases where known relationships between
        these sets of hypotheses can be verified. Given that the
        probability that all three bytes of a given hypothesis can be
        verified will be
        <span class="math">1/2^&#123;24&#125;</span>, one would
        expect that the two sets of
        <span class="math">2^&#123;32&#125;</span> hypotheses can be
        reduced to one set of
        <span class="math">2^&#123;40&#125;</span> hypotheses.
        Continuing in this fashion, one generates additional sets and
        verifies relationships until the full key is recovered.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        The time complexity of the entire attack will be
        <span class="math">2^&#123;38&#125;</span> five-round AES
        encryption operations and require
        <span class="math">2^&#123;40&#125;</span> hypotheses to be

        Attacking a five-round AES-192 will function using a time
        complexity equivalent to
        <span class="math">2^&#123;39&#125;</span> AES encryption
        operations using the attack described in Section 4.2 based on
        the attack proposed by Ferguson et al. <a href="#ref-Fer+01">[Fer+01]</a>. That is, two
        <span class="math">\delta</span>-sets would be sufficient to
        determine the last two subkeys of a five-round instance of
        AES-192 or AES-256.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        An attack on an instance of AES-256 cannot be made more
        efficient by analyzing two consecutive subkeys since there are
        no direct relationships. However, one can exploit the
        relationships between two consecutive subkeys when attacking
        an AES-192. This would follow a similar technique to that
        presented in Section 4.2.

      </h3>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        The attacks on five rounds of AES-192 and AES-256 can be
        extended by assuming that an attacker knows the last subkey.
        The time complexity of the five-round attack does increase by
        a factor of
        <span class="math">2^&#123;128&#125;</span> when it is
        applied to a six round variant of AES-256. However, Lucks
        observed that knowledge of the last subkey would allow an
        attacker to directly derive bytes in previous subkeys when
        attacking AES-192 <a href="#ref-Luc00">[Luc00]</a>. That is, 64 bits of the penultimate
        subkey and 32 bits of the antepenultimate subkey.

        Following the reasoning in Section 4.2, a computational

        standard attack) six-round AES-192 encryption operations to
        treat each <span class="math">\delta</span>-set. As
        previously, two <span class="math">\delta</span>-sets would
        be sufficient to determine the penultimate and

        the &ldquo;partial sums&rdquo; method of conducting the

        If, for example, an attacker wishes to evaluate (5) and knows

        evaluated before the unknown
        <span class="math">(k_2, k_3)</span>. Generating

        the attack described in Section 4.3. The time complexity of

        <span class="math">2^&#123;34&#125;</span> evaluations of the
        function <span class="math">S</span>. That is,
        <span class="math">2^&#123;36&#125;</span> executions of the
        function <span class="math">S</span> for all four 32-bit sets
        for the final subkey, which corresponds to

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">6. Conclusion</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        In this paper we have demonstrated that the &ldquo;partial
        sums&rdquo; method of conducting the Square attack can be
        improved by analyzing more information per
        <span class="math">\delta</span>-set (or
        <span class="math">\Delta</span>-set). This allows the time
        complexity of attacks to be halved. For AES-128 the time
        complexity can be halved again, and reduced by a smaller
        amount for AES-192, by eliminating key hypotheses on-the-fly.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        In Table 11 we present a summary of the attacks presented in
        this paper alongside similar attacks in the literature. The
        memory requirements are the number of state matrices, or
        equivalent, that need to be stored in memory. The number of
        acquisitions are the number of chosen plaintexts enciphered
        with an unknown key, where the number is given in multiples of
        <span class="math">2^8</span> or
        <span class="math">2^&#123;32&#125;</span> so that it is
        clear how many
        <span class="math">\delta</span> or
        <span class="math">\Delta</span>-sets are required to conduct
        the attack. The time complexity is expressed as the
        computational effort required to compute that many AES
        encryption operations.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">
        In this paper we have focused on attacks that require
        relatively few chosen plaintext-ciphertext pairs. Ferguson
        et al. also proposed a Square attack applicable to seven
        rounds of AES-128 and eight rounds for AES-192 and AES-256.
        However, this attack requires approximately
        <span class="math">2^&#123;128&#125;</span> chosen
        plaintext-ciphertext pairs and is beyond the scope of this
        paper although one would expect the proposed strategy to aid
        in the analysis.

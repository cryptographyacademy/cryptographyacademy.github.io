      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Abstract</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300">We present Poseidonb and Poseidon2b, natural variants of Poseidon and Poseidon2, respectively, defined over binary extension fields with a target security level of 128 bits. They are specifically designed to inherit many of the circuit-friendly properties of their prime field version, and to be used together with binary extension field proving systems such as Binius. Benchmarking demonstrates the merits in proof size, proving time, and especially verification time, in comparison to traditional hash functions and other binary circuit-friendly hash functions such as Vision-32b and Anemoi.

Due to the close similarity to their prime field counterparts, many existing cryptanalytic results directly carry over to Poseidonb and Poseidon2b. Nevertheless, we revisit the security analysis to incorporate recent advances in cryptanalysis and to account for attack vectors that do not arise in the prime field setting. In particular, we focus on algebraic cryptanalysis and subspace trails, techniques that resulted in attacks on initial versions of Poseidon defined over binary extension fields. Our complexity estimates are based on the ideal degree, now increasingly adopted as a standard measure in algebraic cryptanalysis.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-5.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5.2 Degree and Density of the Interpolation Polynomial</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To ensure security against algebraic attacks, it is crucial to first study the growth of the degree and density of the polynomials resulting from the Poseidon(2)B permutation. As several isomorphic representations are possible, we limit ourselves to focus on  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}^t</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2^{nt}</span> .</p>

      <h4 id="sec-5.2.1" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">5.2.1 Growth of the Degree &ndash; Forward Direction</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The degree of  <span class="math">x \\mapsto x^7</span>  is 7 over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}</span>  and hw(7) = 3 over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2</span> , implying that to reach maximum degree<sup>5</sup> the total round number R has to satisfy</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$7^R &gt; t \\cdot (2^n - 1)</span>$
and  <span class="math">3^R &gt; n \\cdot t</span> ,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The maximum degree of a polynomial function over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q^t</span>  is  <span class="math">t \\cdot (q-1)</span> , since  <span class="math">x^q = x</span>  in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">implying  <span class="math">R \\ge \\max \\{\\log_7(t) + n \\cdot \\log_7(2), \\log_3(n) + \\log_3(t)\\}</span> . We emphasize that the condition  <span class="math">3^R \\ge n \\cdot t</span>  for the growth of the degree over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2</span>  only provides a lower bound. Indeed, as shown in [Cid+22, Thm. 1] (besides [BCC11; Eic+20]), in the case of an SPN scheme over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}^t</span>  instantiated with  <span class="math">x \\mapsto x^7</span>  over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}</span>  and a linear layer defined via a matrix multiplication in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}^t</span> , the growth of the degree  <span class="math">\\delta(R)</span>  over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2</span>  is given by</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\delta(R) \\leq \\begin{cases} 3^R &amp; \\text{if } R \\leq 1 + \\lfloor \\log_3(t) \\rfloor, \\\\ t \\cdot \\log_2\\left(\\frac{7^R}{t} + 1\\right) &amp; \\text{otherwise}. \\end{cases}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Roughly, this implies</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$t \\cdot \\log_2\\left(\\frac{7^R}{t} + 1\\right) \\ge n \\cdot t \\implies 7^R \\ge t \\cdot (2^n - 1) \\implies R \\ge \\log_7(t) + \\log_7(2^n - 1). \\tag{3}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Lower Bound on the Degree Growth.</strong> It is easy to see that for any assignment of t-1 input variables, the degree of the resulting univariate polynomial grows steadily and reaches at least  <span class="math">2^n/7</span>  after  <span class="math">\\lceil n \\log_7 2 \\rceil - 1</span>  rounds. Indeed, as long as the degree is strictly smaller than  <span class="math">2^n/7</span> , it grows every round exactly by a factor of 7. Since this bound holds for any variable assignment, it also holds for the total degree of the multivariate polynomial.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-5.2.2" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">5.2.2 Growth of the Degree - Backward Direction</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Focusing on the backward direction, we have</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$x^{1/7} = \\begin{cases} x^{\\frac{2^{33}-1}{7}} &amp; \\approx x^{2^{30.19}} &amp; \\text{if } n = 32, \\\\ x^{\\frac{6\\cdot(2^{64}-1)+1}{7}} &amp; \\approx x^{2^{63.78}} &amp; \\text{if } n = 64, \\\\ x^{\\frac{2\\cdot(2^{128}-1)+1}{7}} &amp; \\approx x^{2^{126.19}} &amp; \\text{if } n = 128. \\end{cases}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">This implies that we achieve a very high degree in just a few rounds. We remark that the maximum possible degree is not achieved in the backward direction, though. As proved in [BC13], an invertible function  <span class="math">\\mathcal{F}</span>  over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2^m</span>  has maximum degree if and only if  <span class="math">\\mathcal{F}^{-1}</span>  has maximum degree. Hence, the number of rounds necessary to reach maximum degree in the backward direction is equal to the number necessary to reach maximum degree in the forward direction, as given before.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-5.2.3" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">5.2.3 Density</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Regarding the density, we work under the following definition.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Definition 9.</strong> A polynomial over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}^t</span>  is called <em>dense</em> if it contains  <span class="math">\\Omega(2^{nt})</span>  monomials.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For a random polynomial, each coefficient is non-zero with probability  <span class="math">\\frac{2^n-1}{2^n}</span> . As there are  <span class="math">(2^n)^t</span>  monomials (each variable can have a degree between 0 and  <span class="math">2^n-1</span> ), the definition is satisfied. We have seen that around  <span class="math">\\log_7(t) + n \\cdot \\log_7(2)</span>  rounds are needed to satisfy this condition.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-5.2.4" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">5.2.4 Practical Results</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We conducted practical tests both for the degree growth and for the density of the polynomials in various numbers of variables. In particular, we focus on the case t = 4 and d = 3 when either  <span class="math">n_v = 4</span>  input variables are used (i.e., the entire state consists of symbolic variables) or  <span class="math">n_v = 1</span> , i.e., a single input variable is used, resulting in a univariate representation. In both scenarios, we focus on field sizes  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}</span> , where  <span class="math">n \\in \\{7,15\\}</span> . This</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;6</sup>We need an odd extension of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2</span>  to make the S-box a permutation for d=3.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">    <img src="_page_14_Figure_2.jpeg" alt="" class="my-4 max-w-full" />
</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Figure 3:</strong> The number of monomials reached in SPN, P-SPN, and Poseidon(2)b.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">gives a reasonable probability of avoiding cancellations and at the same time allows us to determine if there are notable differences between fields of different sizes.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The results for the first case, where the entire input state consists of variables, are shown in Fig. <a href="#page-14-0">3.</a> We also include the cases of SPN and Partial-SPN permutations, where the former consists of only full (external) rounds and the latter consists of only partial (internal) rounds. As can be seen, full rounds contribute better to density than partial rounds; however, the difference between them is not asymptotically significant. In particular, mixing the rounds in Poseidon(2)b leads to a better behavior than only using a P-SPN.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the second case, where <em>n<sup>v</sup></em> = 1 results in a univariate representation, we could measure no notable difference between an SPN, a P-SPN, and our Poseidon(2)b construction. Essentially, the maximum number of monomials, in this case <em>d <sup>R</sup></em> = 3<em><sup>R</sup></em>, is always reached, apart from some negligible constant resulting from the probability of cancellations.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-5.2.5" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>5.2.5 Interpolation Attack</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The interpolation attack <a href="#page-32-9">[JK97]</a> aims to re-construct the polynomial that defines the attacked scheme, and exploiting it to break the scheme. To ensure security against the interpolation attack, it is necessary that the number of monomials in the multivariate polynomial is close to the security level. Based on this, we require the following:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&bull; When working on the forward direction, we impose that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$R_F + R_P \\ge \\lceil \\log_7(t) \\rceil + \\lceil n \\cdot \\log_7(2) \\rceil</span>$
.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As we saw before, this number of rounds guarantees a degree above 2 <em><sup>n</sup>/</em>7 and, based on our practical tests, sufficient density. This implies the total number of monomials being at least 2 <em><sup>n</sup>/</em>7, which makes the total complexity of the interpolation attack exceed 2 <em>n</em>.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">&bull; In the backward direction, 4 full external rounds are sufficient to get a comparable degree bound.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As we are not aware of any Meet-in-the-Middle interpolation attack on a hash function, we claim that the interpolation attack should not be possible whenever</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">
<span class="math">$R_F + R_P \\ge \\lceil \\log_7(t) \\rceil + \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\min\\{n, 128\\}}{\\log_2(7)} \\right\\rceil . \\tag{4}</span>$</p>

      <h4 id="sec-5.2.6" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">5.2.6 Higher-Order Differential Attacks</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the case of a binary function, higher-order differential attacks [Knu94; Lai94b] exploit the fact that given a function  <span class="math">\\mathcal{F}</span>  over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2^n</span>  of degree  <span class="math">\\delta</span> , then</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\bigoplus_{x \\in \\mathfrak{V}} \\mathcal{F}(x) = 0</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">for any affine subspace  <span class="math">\\mathfrak{V} \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_2^n</span>  of dimension at least  <span class="math">\\delta + 1</span>  (that is,  <span class="math">\\dim(\\mathfrak{V}) \\ge \\deg(\\mathcal{F}) + 1</span> ). Here, we claim that the number of rounds that ensure security against interpolation attacks guarantees security against higher-order differential attacks as well.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Algebraic attacks describe a cryptographic primitive under a specific attack scenario as a system of polynomial equations over a finite field and apply system-solving techniques to this model. While an attacker's goal is to outperform exhaustive search with such techniques, designers use algebraic attacks to guide the choice of secure round numbers. This section aims to briefly recall the most common system solving strategies and estimate algebraic attack complexities for Poseidon(2)B. In contrast to Poseidon, we follow a different methodology: instead of basing the analysis on Gr&ouml;bner basis computations with respect to a degree order, we estimate the attack complexity via the cost of retrieving a univariate polynomial in the ideal, taking into account the latest cryptanalysis results. Moreover, we explicitly state a conjecture on the ideal degree for a wide range of algebraic models, supported by extensive experimental evidence. A detailed comparison of the resulting (partial) round-number derivation strategies for Poseidon(2)B versus Poseidon(2) is given in Section 5.6.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 5. We restrict our investigation to the attacks on short-input hashing, which require only one call to the permutation  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}</span> . To the best of our knowledge, all algebraic attacks become more expensive when long inputs are considered. Further, with the derivation of round numbers in mind, we intentionally state optimistic, i.e., complexity-underestimating, bounds to ensure that the resulting parameters are safely conservative.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-5.3.1" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">5.3.1 Algebraic System Solving</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let  <span class="math">\\{p_1,\\ldots,p_m\\}\\subset \\mathbb{F}_q[x_1,\\ldots,x_m]</span>  be a set of m polynomials in m variables over the finite field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> . For each polynomial  <span class="math">p_j</span> , let  <span class="math">\\delta_j:=\\deg(p_j)</span>  denote its total degree, and for each variable  <span class="math">x_i</span> , let  <span class="math">\\delta_{x_i}:=\\max_j\\{\\deg_{x_i}(p_j)\\}</span>  be its maximal degree across all equations. The goal is to solve the corresponding equations system  <span class="math">\\{p_1=0,\\ldots,p_m=0\\}</span>  over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 6. For simplicity, we concentrate on square systems, i.e., systems with the same number of variables and equations, since the considered algebraic models of Poseidon2B, summarized in App. A, fall into this category.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Root-Finding for Univariate Systems. To find the solutions to a single univariate polynomial equation of degree  <span class="math">\\delta</span>  over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> , one can either apply an off-the-shelf factorization algorithm (e.g., Cantor-Zassenhaus [CZ81; ES11], Berlekamp [Ber70], Kaltofen-Shoup [KS95]), or use the FFT-based root-finding technique of [Bar+22], which requires</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$C_{\\text{uni}}(\\delta) \\in \\mathcal{O}\\left(\\delta \\cdot \\log(\\delta) \\cdot (\\log(\\delta) + \\log(q)) \\cdot \\log\\log(\\delta)\\right) \\ge \\delta \\tag{5}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">operations in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  if only a few roots actually lie in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Gr&ouml;bner Bases Theory.</strong> Gr&ouml;bner bases [Buc65] provide a generic and widely used method for solving systems of polynomial equations that generate a zero-dimensional ideal I (i.e., the number of solutions to this system is finite). Algebraic models for symmetric primitives typically lead to such systems, and a <em>Gr&ouml;bner basis attack</em> consists of the following three steps, where the quantity  <span class="math">2 \\le \\omega &lt; 3</span>  denotes the linear algebra constant.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Compute the Gr&ouml;bner basis of I in degrevlex order. The complexity of this step is typically estimated as  <span class="math">m \\cdot {m+\\deg \\choose m}^{\\omega}</span>  operations over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  using the F5 algorithm [BFS15], where  <span class="math">\\deg \\leq 1 + \\sum_{j=1}^m (\\delta_j 1)</span>  denotes the degree of regularity of the system. The stated bound is known as Macaulay bound.</li>
    </ol></li>
      <li><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Obtain a triangular system by converting the degrevlex Gr&ouml;bner basis to lexicographic order. The complexity of this step is typically estimated as  <span class="math">m \\cdot \\mathbf{d_l}^{\\omega}</span>  operations over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  using a probabilistic version of the FGLM algorithm [Fau+14], where  <span class="math">\\mathbf{d_l} \\leq \\prod_{j=1}^m \\delta_j</span>  is the degree of the ideal  <span class="math">\\mathbf{l} = \\langle p_1, \\dots, p_m \\rangle</span> . The stated bound is known as B&eacute;zout bound.</li>
    </ol></li>
      <li><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Solve the univariate polynomial in the <em>lexicographic</em> Gr&ouml;bner basis and back-substitute roots if necessary. Since we are dealing with zero-dimensional ideals, this univariate polynomial has degree  <span class="math">\\delta = d_I</span>  and the complexity of this step is estimated as  <span class="math">C_{\\text{uni}}(d_I)</span> .</li>
    </ol></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For regular systems, the above bounds are tight, and the complexity of a Gr&ouml;bner basis attack is typically given by that of the &quot;hardest&quot; step. Unfortunately, systems arising from AO primitives are often not regular, and these bounds can vastly overestimate the true attack complexity. In general, computing  <span class="math">d_{reg}</span>  and  <span class="math">d_{l}</span>  is as hard as computing the Gr&ouml;bner basis itself, so practical estimates often rely on retrieving these values from Gr&ouml;bner basis attacks on round-reduced instances; see, for instance, [BGL20; KLR24]. Arguably, basing the attack complexity on the first step is problematic, as it may be skipped for suitable monomial orderings and models [Bar+24; CR25], and closed-form estimates of  <span class="math">d_{reg}</span>  are only rough approximations. In contrast, as noted by [Per24], the second step is much better understood, with strong conjectures and sometimes even proofs of  <span class="math">d_{l}</span> . The third step is typically negligible in comparison. We therefore estimate the complexity of a Gr&ouml;bner basis attack by the cost of the second step, namely</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$C_{\\mathsf{gb2}}(\\mathbf{d_l}) \\in \\mathcal{O}\\left(m \\cdot \\mathbf{d_l}^{\\omega}\\right) \\ge \\mathbf{d_l}^2</span>$
(6)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">operations in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span>  with  <span class="math">2 \\leq \\omega &lt; 3</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 7. Note that the basis conversion step can be replaced by other techniques, such as the recently applied Eigenvalue method [CR25], to obtain a univariate polynomial. However, all methods presented in the literature so far can optimistically be estimated using  <span class="math">d_I^{\\omega}</span> . We thus omit further details.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Resultants for Bivariate Systems.</strong> Resultants provide a classical elimination strategy for solving two polynomial equations in two variables. Given a bivariate equation system  <span class="math">\\{p_1(x_1, x_2) = 0, p_2(x_1, x_2) = 0\\}</span> , the <em>resultant attack</em> consists of two main steps:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Compute the bivariate resultant  <span class="math">r = \\operatorname{Res}_{x_2}(p_1, p_2) \\in \\mathbb{F}_q[x_1]</span> . Using the approach described in [GKR25; Bar+25], computing the bivariate resultant  <span class="math">\\operatorname{Res}_{x_2}(p_1, p_2) \\in \\mathbb{F}_q[x_1]</span>  requires  <span class="math">\\delta_{x_1} \\delta_{x_2}^2 \\cdot \\log^2(\\delta_{x_1} \\delta_{x_2}) \\cdot \\log\\log(\\delta_{x_1} \\delta_{x_2})</span>  operations in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q</span></li>

      <li>Solve the univariate polynomial r to recover the x-coordinates of the solutions and backsubstitute, if necessary. Since  <span class="math">\\deg(r) \\geq d_{\\rm l}</span> , the complexity of this step is estimated as  <span class="math">C_{\\rm uni}(d_{\\rm l})</span> .</li>
    </ol></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In general, computing the bivariate resultant of two dense degree- <span class="math">\\delta</span>  polynomials requires at least  <span class="math">\\delta^2</span>  operations. We therefore estimate the complexity of a resultant-based attack as</p>

. (7)</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Remark 8. Instead of symbolically computing the bivariate resultant, [Bak+25b] employs an evaluation-interpolation method of similar complexity and observes that for Poseidon2, the degree of the resultant coincides with the degree of the polynomial ideal.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Iterated Resultants. Iterated resultants can be used to successively eliminate variables. [Yan+24] recently applied this method to CICO-1 instances of primitives with inversion S-boxes. [Bar+25] improves the reduction procedure and derives concrete complexity estimates for this setting. As the complexity of these approaches essentially depends on the ideal degree, and as  <span class="math">Poseidon(2)B^{\\pi}</span>  is not instantiated with high-degree S-boxes (corresponding to the inverses of low-degree S-boxes, as in the case of Rescue, Anemoi, and Griffin), we do not provide further details and consider Gr&ouml;bner basis cryptanalysis sufficient to cover this aspect.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we estimate the complexity of algebraic attacks on Poseidon(2)B under different attack scenarios. We briefly review algebraic modeling options and show how these scenarios reduce to CICO-like problems, making our complexity estimates a consequence of solving that core problem.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Poseidon(2)B can be modeled over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}</span>  in several ways<sup>7</sup>: a round-based formulation with variables after each S-box, a global model capturing all rounds at once, or hybrids in between. Although syntactically different, these representations define the same solution set and thus the same polynomial ideal. However, those systems are usually underdetermined. By using the available degrees of freedom, it is possible to retrieve a square system (i.e., same number of variables and equations), restrict the system-solving to a finite subset of the solution space, and reduce solving complexity. The following approaches have been presented in the literature for Poseidon(2), and are also applicable to Poseidon(2)B:<sup>8</sup></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Some state within the partial rounds is restricted to an affine subspace permitting a subspace trail (of maximum length), i.e., the covered partial rounds can be linearized.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">A detailed description of the different algebraic models is given in App. A. Table 2 lists the conjectured ideal degrees. Notably, differences in ideal degree arise from how the degrees of freedom are exploited, i.e., from working on differently shaped subsets of the original solution set.

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Preimage Attacks.</strong> Algebraic preimage attacks on both compression and sponge variants for Poseidon-like primitives are almost identical, see also [GKR25]. Consider the latter case with a single call to the Poseidon2B permutation first.</p>

      <li>If  <span class="math">\\chi \\geq c</span> , we first observe that any valid preimage attack is a valid partial-preimage attack on c output words.

      <li>If  <span class="math">\\chi &lt; c</span> , any preimage attack is a valid CICO- <span class="math">(c, \\chi)</span>  attack.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To summarize, all valid preimage attacks that work independently of the preimage value are valid CICO attacks.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For the compression case, the equations are similar with a small difference: instead of  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_i(x_0,\\ldots,x_{t-1})=h_i</span> , we consider  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_i(x_0,\\ldots,x_{t-1})=x_i+h_i</span> . We observe that adding the extra term does not reduce the complexity of any attack we have considered, so we conclude that the preimage attacks are as expensive as CICO- <span class="math">\\chi</span> . The same holds for the second preimage attacks.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that for a usual choice of  <span class="math">\\chi = \\frac{256}{n}</span> , which holds for all proposed Poseidon(2)B instances, security against the CICO-k problem with  <span class="math">k = \\frac{128}{n}</span>  implies security against the CICO- <span class="math">\\chi</span>  problem, and thus preimage attacks.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Collision Attacks.</strong> Algebraic collision attacks are known to be even more expensive than preimage attacks due to twice the number of variables. One may hope to skip a few partial rounds by requiring the difference not to activate any S-box in those, but we were unable to exploit this trick to get the complexity low enough. The same argument applies to both the sponge and the compression mode.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Target Collision Attacks.</strong> We are unable to exploit the target scenario in this kind attacks. Therefore, the best attack we are aware of is to select j and find  <span class="math">m^*</span>  with a preimage attack, which reduces to CICO- <span class="math">\\chi</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Zero-Test Attacks.</strong> We only consider the case where the function  <span class="math">\\mathcal{H}</span>  in the definition of zero-test resistance involves only one call to the Poseidon(2)B permutation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Let us start with the simple case  <span class="math">\\chi = k = 1</span> . By definition, the adversary needs to find  <span class="math">(g_0, g_1, \\ldots, g_d) \\in \\mathbb{F}_{2^n}^{d+1}</span>  (with some of the  <span class="math">g_i</span>  being non-zero for i &gt; 0) such that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\bigoplus_{j} g_j \\cdot \\mathcal{P}_1^j(g_0, g_1, \\dots, g_d) = 0</span>$</p>

For all algebraic attack methods that we consider, the degree of algebraic equations grows compared to the CICO problems. We were unable to exploit the appearance of extra variables as multipliers, and thus conclude that the problem is as hard as CICO-1. This reasoning applies equally well to the sponge and the compression mode.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With bigger  <span class="math">\\chi</span>  and k we obtain a set of equations involving different  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}_i</span> . We do not see any way to exploit this scenario without running the CICO-k problem under the hood.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-5.4" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5.4 Rebound Attacks</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Rebound attacks [Men+09; Lam+09] are one of the most effective techniques to set up collisions in the case of AES-like hash functions. Introduced by Mendel et al. at FSE 2009, it can be applied to both block cipher-based and permutation-based constructions. The idea of the rebound attack is to divide the attack into two phases: an inbound phase and an outbound phase. The aim of the inbound phase is to use the available degrees of freedom to find, at a low cost, a large number of pairs of values that satisfy a (part of a) differential path that would be very expensive to satisfy in a probabilistic way. The outbound phase then uses these values to perform an attack.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the following, we describe these phases in the case of Poseidon(2)B.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Inbound Phase. The best scenario for the attacker consists in finding a pair of texts whose input difference and whose output differences are equal to zero in one  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span> -word, for a total of two constraints. Indeed, note that any other condition imposes a higher number of constraints on the input and/or output difference of such pair of texts. Based on the analysis just given, and due to the strong statistical properties of the full external rounds, the possible best approach for finding such pair of texts is via Gr&ouml;bner basis attacks. Note that this problem can be turned into a CICO problem by fixing one of the two text. Due to the previous analysis, here we conjecture that the number of rounds necessary to guarantee security against any CICO problem is also sufficient to ensure security against the inbound phase of a rebound attack;</li>
      <li>Outbound Phase. As pointed out in Section 5.1.2, there are no truncated differentials for 2 or more external full rounds with probability (much) smaller than for the case of a pseudo-random permutation. Hence, we claim that an attacker can cover at most 1+1=2 full external full rounds are sufficient to ensure security against the outbound phase of a rebound attack.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Putting all together, we claim that the maximum number of rounds covered by a rebound attack is given by the maximum number of rounds that can be broken via a GB attack (assuming  <span class="math">\\leq 4</span>  external full rounds), plus 1+1=2 external full rounds, for a total of maximum 6 external rounds.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">At the same time, we also consider the rebound attack based on the statistical properties only. Following the same argument proposed for Poseidon(2), we recall that the best rebound attack on AES covers 8 rounds. As 2 rounds of AES are necessary to achieve full diffusion versus 1 round of Poseidon(2)B, we claim that 6 external full rounds of Poseidon(2)B are sufficient to prevent this last strategy for the rebound attack.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-5.5" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5.5 Round Numbers</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In this section, we present the derivation of the round numbers for Poseidon(2)B. The parameters are chosen to withstand all attacks currently known in the literature, using the minimum number of rounds necessary to provide security, plus an additional security margin. As in the security analysis of Poseidon(2), we aim to protect against statistical attacks through a sufficient number of full rounds, and against algebraic attacks through carefully selected partial round numbers. A summary is given in Table 1.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-5.5.1" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">5.5.1 Number of Full Rounds</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The analysis of statistical attacks, including rebound attacks, implies that  <span class="math">R_F = 6</span>  is sufficient to prevent those.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-5.5.2" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">5.5.2 Number of Partial Rounds</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Now we compute how many partial rounds we need to prevent various algebraic attacks on the CICO-k problem with  <span class="math">k \\leq \\frac{128}{n}</span> , which we have shown to be foundational with respect to other properties. Due to the rebound attack, we consider the CICO-k problem for  <span class="math">R_F = 4</span>  (see before for details). We analyze how many rounds can be broken under different &quot;hardness assumptions&quot;, concretely:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li><strong>Interpolation:</strong> The overall polynomial must reach a high degree and density so that interpolation attacks are infeasible (see Eq. (4)).</li>
      <li>Univariate Solving (k = 1): Directly solving the univariate CICO-1 equation should be infeasible (see Eq. (9)).</li>
      <li>Multivariate Solving  <span class="math">(k \\geq 2)</span> : Let I be the ideal generated by polynomials modeling the CICO-k problem, and let  <span class="math">d_I</span>  denote the ideal degree. Finding a univariate polynomial in I (for example via Gr&ouml;bner bases or bivariate resultants) should be infeasible (see Eq. (9)).</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In particular, we ignore the &quot;system setup&quot; cost and the cost of computing a Gr&ouml;bner basis, potentially granting the attacker an advantage. Our analysis is summarized in the formula below. We note, though, that it pertains to the Poseidon(2) <span class="math">B^{\\pi}</span>  instances listed in Table 1. Any application beyond that would require further cryptanalysis.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">
<span class="math">$R_{P} \\ge \\max \\left\\{ \\lceil \\log_{7}(t) \\rceil + \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\min\\{n, 128\\}}{\\log_{2}(7)} \\right\\rceil - 3, \\max_{3 \\le k \\le \\frac{128}{n}} \\left\\{ \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\min\\{kn, 128\\}}{2 \\log_{2}(7)} \\right\\rceil - 3k \\right\\} \\right\\}. (11)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The round-number formulas for interpolation and univariate solving were merged for simplicity. We highlight that only the first term directly depends on the state size t.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-5.5.3" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6"><strong>5.5.3 Security Margin</strong></h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We increase the number of full rounds from 6 to 8, in general, and add another 2 full rounds for Poseidon2b with <em>n</em> &isin; {32<em>,</em> 64} due to improved full-round skipping techniques in the non-MDS case <a href="#page-28-7">[Bak+25a]</a>. The number of partial rounds is increased by 30%.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We conclude this section by comparing the round number derivation of Poseidon(2)b and Poseidon(2).</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Number or Partial Rounds.</strong> For Poseidon, it was assumed that &quot;the security of permutations against Gr&ouml;bner basis attacks follows from the infeasible complexity of computing the Gr&ouml;bner basis in degrevlex order&quot; <a href="#page-31-9">[Gra+19b,</a> &sect;C.2.2]. In contrast, we base the analysis of Poseidon(2)b on the complexity of either retrieving or solving a univariate polynomial in the ideal. This has several reasons:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>(i) Using a specifically crafted order, the first step of a Gr&ouml;bner basis attack might be skipped in certain cases <a href="#page-28-4">[Bar+24]</a>. While this has not been applied to Poseidon, we think this result justifies revisiting the algebraic cryptanalysis.</li>
      <li>(ii) The <em>degree of regularity</em> is upper-bounded by the Macaulay bound, which <a href="#page-28-10">[ABM24]</a> experimentally shows to be an overestimate. Interestingly, the subsequent derivations then give the complexity of the second step of a Gr&ouml;bner-basis attack, but with the B&eacute;zout bound used in place of the true ideal degree. In more detail, the complexity of solving the CICO-<em>k</em> problem (for <em>k</em> &ge; 2) is estimated as follows:<a href="#page-21-2">10</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">
<span class="math">$C_{\\mathtt{gb1}}(\\mathbf{d}_{\\mathrm{reg}}) = \\binom{k \\cdot \\alpha^{R_F + R_P}}{k}^2 \\geq \\left(\\alpha^{k \\cdot (R_F + R_P)}\\right)^2 = C_{\\mathtt{gb2}}\\left(\\mathbf{d}_{\\mathsf{I}}\\right) \\,,</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where dreg &asymp; <em>k</em> &middot;(<em>&alpha; <sup>R</sup><sup>F</sup></em> <sup>+</sup><em>R<sup>P</sup></em> &minus;1) using the Macaulay bound and d<sup>I</sup> &asymp; <em>&alpha; <sup>k</sup></em>&middot;(<em>R<sup>F</sup></em> <sup>+</sup><em>R<sup>P</sup></em> ) using the B&eacute;zout bound. We are aware, however, that the B&eacute;zout number overestimates the actual ideal degree. We therefore state explicit conjectures for that degree (see Table <a href="#page-18-0">2)</a> and base our round-number derivation on them.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">(iii) We want to explicitly take the latest cryptanalysis results on Poseidon into account, including resultant-based approaches <a href="#page-34-6">[Yan+24;</a> <a href="#page-28-8">Bar+25;</a> <a href="#page-28-9">Bak+25b]</a> and various round-skipping techniques <a href="#page-31-8">[GKR25;</a> <a href="#page-28-9">Bak+25b]</a>. We also mention the recent Graeffetransform attacks <a href="#page-34-1">[ZD25;</a> <a href="#page-34-0">SV25]</a> but stress that they provide only a constant factor improvement, and not for all fields.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Overall, we arrive at a simpler formula for the number of partial rounds (cf. Eq. <a href="#page-20-1">(11)</a>). For comparison, for Poseidon(2) this number (for <em>&kappa;</em>-bit security) is derived as</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$R_{P} = \\left[ \\max \\left\\{ 1 + \\left[ \\frac{\\min\\{n, \\kappa\\}}{\\log_{2}(d)} \\right] + \\left\\lceil \\log_{d}(t) \\right\\rceil - R_{F}, \\frac{\\min\\{n, \\kappa\\}}{\\log_{2}(d)} - R_{F}, \\right. \\right.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\left. t - 1 + \\log_{d}(2) \\cdot \\min \\left\\{ \\frac{\\kappa}{t+1}, \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\} - R_{F}, t - 2 + \\frac{\\kappa}{2 \\log_{2}(d)} - (t-1)R_{F}, r&#x27;_{GB} \\right\\} \\right],</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$(12)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <em>n</em> = &lceil;log<sup>2</sup> (<em>p</em>)&rceil; denotes the field size, <em>d</em> is the degree of the S-boxes, the first term in Eq. <a href="#page-21-3">(12)</a> accounts for interpolation attacks, and the others for Gr&ouml;bner basis attacks (see <a href="#page-31-9">[Gra+19b,</a> &sect;C.2.2], <a href="#page-31-1">[GKS23b,</a> Eq. (1)], and <a href="#page-32-11">[Hor]</a>). A concrete comparison of the round numbers is given in Table <a href="#page-22-1">3.</a> We make the following observations:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>10</sup>We exemplarily discuss the case of &quot;Full-Permutation Equations&quot;. However, these observations similarly apply to the derivations when &quot;Working at Round Level&quot;.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li><strong>First term</strong>: corresponds to interpolation attacks and dominates when working over large fields (hence for small state sizes).</li>
      <li>Third term: captures the possibility of skipping partial rounds via subspace trails; this becomes more relevant for large state sizes (and thus smaller fields), as the number of skippable rounds grows with t (see App. A.1). As shown in [GKR25], the potential of this attack is overestimated, leading to inflated round numbers for certain instances (e.g., n = 31 with t = 24).</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In conclusion, for smaller fields and larger state sizes, the round number selection is primarily driven by Gr&ouml;bner basis attacks. However, the influence of the state size is less pronounced than initially expected, and the potential benefit of partial-round skipping appears to have been overestimated. On the other hand, for larger fields, interpolation becomes the dominant factor. Notably, for a given field size, the same partial round number can be used for both state sizes in the POSEIDON(2)B instantiations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Security Margin.</strong> The security margin consists of 2 external full rounds ( <span class="math">R_F = 8</span>  instead of  <span class="math">R_F = 6</span> ) and 7.5% or 30% more internal partial rounds for Poseidon(2), and Poseidon(2)B, respectively. We increase the margin for Poseidon(2)B to 30% to remain comfortably secure, as binary Poseidon(2) variants are still less explored, especially regarding MitM interpolation, partially active S-box subspace trails, and potential exploits via an  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_2</span>  representation.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To show a practical use case, we focus on the setting of a recursive verifier, i.e., a prover that attests the validity of a previous proof. As is the case with many similar constructions, a recursive verifier for Binius needs to replicate many of the prover's verification steps in a corresponding verification circuit. Some of these steps require the call to hash functions, for example, to validate commitments. It is therefore important that the hash function used for these commitments during the proving phase is somewhat arithmetization-friendly. Otherwise, the verification circuit in a recursive verifier is more expensive.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">With this scenario in mind, we provide a proof implementation of Poseidon(2)B in the Binius framework and compare its proof size, proving time, and verification time with hash functions already supported by Binius, additionally implementing Anemoi [Bou+23] as another binary circuit-friendly hash function for comparison.<sup>12</sup></p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;11</sup>Note that while [GKS23b, &sect;7.3] states a security margin of 12.5%, only 7.5% are effectively applied, as can be seen in Table [GKS23a, Table 1] and the round numer derivation script [Hor, Line 75].</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;12</sup>Note that the designers defined binary Anemoi over  <span class="math">2^n</span>  for n odd and set  <span class="math">\\alpha = 2^i + 1</span>  such that</p>

      <h3 id="sec-6.1" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">6.1 Overview of Binius</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The Binius and, in particular, the FRI-Binius framework [DP24] introduces a novel and efficient way to extend the Plonkish [GWC19] family of constraint systems to operate natively over binary extension fields. Conceptually, it preserves the structural principles of Plonkish systems, i.e., computations are represented as a tabular execution trace of dimension  <span class="math">T \\times w</span> , where each row corresponds to one state of the computation and each column represents a register or wire. As in Plonkish and AIR-style frameworks, constraints are expressed as low-degree polynomial relations that connect values across rows. A general constraint, simplified, thus takes the form</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathcal{F}(a_{i,1},\\ldots,a_{i,w},a_{i+1,1},\\ldots,a_{i+1,w})=0,</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">\\mathcal{F}</span>  is a bounded-degree multivariate polynomial over the chosen base field.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">In the past, nearly all Plonkish and SNARK-style systems have been defined over prime fields  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_p</span>  of various sizes. In contrast, Binius employs binary extension fields  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^k}</span> , enabling each field element to map directly to a k-bit word in memory. This eliminates the need for expensive modular reductions after additions and multiplications and allows all arithmetic operations to be implemented as native instructions or vectorized logic on CPUs. <sup>13</sup> In most cases, it also eliminates the <em>embedding overhead</em>, which means that essentially no bits are &quot;wasted&quot; when embedding an actual data element into a register. This is due to the fact that the register size can be chosen almost freely. Consequently, in some settings, using binary fields can improve bandwidth and circuit simplicity.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">FRI-Binius also remains fully compatible with the FRI protocol for low-degree testing. The switch from prime to binary extension fields does not affect the algebraic structure required by FRI, as &ndash; with some modifications &ndash; the same principles of domain extension and polynomial verification apply equally over  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^n}</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Further, there is a crucial difference between Binius and other proof systems using prime fields. Indeed, in Binius, it is possible to mix constraints operating over binary extension fields of different sizes. This is possible thanks to its ring-switching protocol [DP24], which essentially allows connecting constraints over smaller binary extension fields to commitments over packed 128-bit binary extension field values. In contrast, proof systems over prime fields used in practice fix the base field throughout the entire arithmetization, limiting the granularity of the constraint design. With this mechanism, distinct parts of the computation can operate at different bit widths. For example, lightweight control logic can be encoded in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^8}</span> , while more arithmetic-heavy subroutines, such as hash functions, are evaluated in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{64}}</span> . The ability to switch between these rings efficiently at well-defined boundaries results in a system where each component can be implemented and optimized at its natural binary size.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Tower Fields in Binius.</strong> Switching between the various binary extension fields is only possible when abiding by some predefined rules. One of them consists of using binary tower fields, which provide a well-defined way of translating between  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{n_1}}^{k_1}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{n_2}}^{k_2}</span>  whenever  <span class="math">n_1k_1=n_2k_2,\\ n_1=2^{m_1},\\</span> and  <span class="math">n_2=2^{m_2}</span>  for  <span class="math">m_1,m_2\\geq 0.</span>  In particular, Binius uses the Wiedemann tower, where  <span class="math">\\mathbb{T}_0:=\\mathbb{F}_2</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{T}_m</span>  is defined recursively via</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathbb{T}_m := \\begin{cases} \\mathbb{T}_0[x_0]/\\langle x_0^2 + x_0 + 1 \\rangle &amp; \\text{for } m = 1, \\\\ \\mathbb{T}_{m-1}[x_{m-1}]/\\langle x_{m-1}^2 + x_{m-2}x_{m-1} + 1 \\rangle &amp; \\text{for } m &gt; 1. \\end{cases}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">&lt;sup&gt;\\&lt;/sup&gt;gcd(i,n)=1</span> . To provide a reasonable comparison using  <span class="math">n\\in\\{32,64,128\\}</span> , our Anemoi implementation uses  <span class="math">E(x)=x^7</span>  ( <span class="math">\\alpha=7=2^2+3</span> ) in the non-linear layer and MDS Cauchy matrices for the linear layer.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><sup>&amp;</sup>lt;sup&gt;13</sup>Most modern CPUs support the CLMUL instructions, and reductions in binary extension fields are often more efficient than in prime fields.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that for each m &gt; 1, the polynomial  <span class="math">x_{m-1}^2 + x_{m-2}x_{m-1} + 1</span>  is irreducible in  <span class="math">\\mathbb{T}_{m-1}[x_{m-1}]</span> . Thus, by induction, the quotient ring  <span class="math">\\mathbb{T}_m</span>  can be viewed as a quadratic field extension of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{T}_{m-1}</span>  with generator  <span class="math">x_{m-1}</span> , and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{T}_m</span>  is isomorphic to  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{2^m}}</span>  for all  <span class="math">m \\geq 0</span> . The advantage of using the tower field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{T}_m</span>  over the isomorphic field  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{2^m}}</span>  with univariate modulus of degree  <span class="math">2^m</span>  is that the recursive structure carries over to arithmetic operations, effectively improving the efficiency of multiplication and inversion in the field. Moreover, it makes field size conversions in the context of the ring-switching protocol easily possible.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Virtual Polynomials.</strong> In Binius, as in other common PCS, the prover commits to a computation in columns representing multilinear polynomials. The committed columns are then constrained and can be evaluated by the verifier at arbitrary points. In addition to the committed polynomials, Binius enables the usage of virtual polynomials. Virtual polynomials are algebraically linked to committed polynomials, but the prover does not need to commit to them. The evaluation is done locally by the verifier using virtual evaluation protocols.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">One example of a virtual protocol in Binius is <em>linear combinations</em>. Consider, for instance, the case where we want to commit to a matrix multiplication  <span class="math">y = M \\times x</span> . For a single lane, we construct the linear combination</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">
<span class="math">$y_i = \\sum_{j=0}^{t-1} M_{i,j} \\cdot x_j \\,, \\tag{13}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where the prover maintains this expression only as a <em>virtual polynomial</em>, i.e., without creating an explicit commitment. The verifier can then query some evaluation point r by virtually querying  <span class="math">x_0(r), x_1(r), \\ldots x_{t-1}(r)</span>  and locally computing the corresponding linear combination. According to Binius, as long as t remains sufficiently small, employing such virtual protocols &ndash; thereby avoiding additional commitments &ndash; can significantly improve overall efficiency.</p>

      <h3 id="sec-6.2" class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">6.2 Poseidon(2)b for Binius</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Since the original Poseidon hash function is defined over prime fields, its usage would require significant overhead, resulting from the fact that all arithmetic operations would have to be simulated in a nonnative field. This supports the demand for a binary variant of Poseidon(2)B. Due to the field isomorphism between  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_{2^{2^m}}</span>  and  <span class="math">\\mathbb{T}_m</span> , our Poseidon(2)B<sup> <span class="math">\\pi</span> </sup> instantiations with  <span class="math">n \\in \\{32, 64, 128\\}</span>  naturally carry over to the tower field notation with  <span class="math">m \\in \\{5, 6, 7\\}</span> , respectively.</p>

      <h4 id="sec-6.2.1" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">6.2.1 Overview of the Arithmetization Costs</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Arithmetization Cost of Non-Linear components.</strong> For full rounds, we commit to the t S-box computations. In the constraint, the committed value x is used to locally compute  <span class="math">x^7</span> , which is then compared against the committed value of  <span class="math">x^7</span> . For partial rounds, only one S-box is computed. Thus, we only need to commit to one  <span class="math">x^7</span>  computation, resulting in one committed column per round.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Arithmetization Cost of Linear Components. For full rounds, the linear operations (round constant addition and matrix multiplication) can be captured in t virtual columns each. Those virtual columns build virtual polynomials that can be evaluated efficiently as linear combinations by the verifier (see Eq. (13)). For partial rounds, only a single virtual column is needed to represent the round constant addition. The internal matrix multiplication still acts on the entire state and therefore requires t virtual columns per partial round. However, the associated virtual polynomials are structurally simpler than</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We provide a proof implementation for each parameter set using the Binius Rust framework in Table 1. The open-source Binius Rust framework is currently in active development. We refer to the committed state 924103fe for this implementation. The Binius Rust framework already includes proof implementations <sup>14</sup> for Keccak-f [Ber+13; Ber+11], SHA-256 [NIS15], Gr&oslash;stl-P [Gau+09], and Vision Mark-32b [Ash+24]. The implementation in Binius provides a proof of correct computation for a number of concatenated Poseidon(2) <span class="math">B^{\\pi}</span> -permutations calls. By benchmarking  <span class="math">2^{14}</span>  such permutation calls, we demonstrate the costs of proving the calculation of a Poseidon (2)B hash of a message of 1MB, thereby showing that the prover knows the preimage to this hash function computation. The contribution of our implementation of the concrete constraint system for  <span class="math">Poseidon(2)B^{\\pi}</span>  in Binius. This constraint system is integrated in the commitment step and connected to the prove and verify steps, which are implemented in Binius, for a full proof. We compare our proof implementation with the existing proof implementations. The performance of the proof implementation is compared based on the hash output size, depending on the throughput of the hash function. All performances were benchmarked on an AMD Ryzen 9 7900x with 12 cores. The Rust implementations were compiled and run in the release mode using the RUST-FLAG='-C target-cpu-native'. The results are shown in Table 4. In particular:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Keccak-f shows relatively small proof sizes and fast multi-threaded proving times. However, all Poseidon(2) <span class="math">B^{\\pi}</span>  variants outperform Keccak-f in single-threaded runtime and verification time. Specifically, the Poseidon(2) <span class="math">B^{\\pi}</span>  variants with n = 32, t = 16 and  <span class="math">n = \\{64, 128\\}</span>  achieve smaller proof sizes than Keccak-f;</li>
      <li>SHA-256 shows the slowest performance overall and requires the largest proof sizes across all evaluated primitives. In contrast, Poseidon(2) <span class="math">^{\\pi}</span>  outperforms SHA-256 in all metrics;</li>
      <li>Gr&oslash;stl-P shows competitive proof sizes and fast proving times. At the same time, Poseidon(2) <span class="math">B^{\\pi}</span>  variants with  <span class="math">n=32,\\,t=8</span>  and  <span class="math">n=32,\\,t=16</span>  outperform Gr&oslash;stl in both proving and verification times, while also reducing proof sizes;</li>
      <li>The Poseidon(2) <span class="math">B^{\\pi}</span>  variants approximately halve the verification time of Vision-32b and also show significant reductions in proving time. Furthermore, Poseidon(2) <span class="math">B^{\\pi}</span>  variants consistently produce smaller proof sizes compared to Vision-32b.</li>
      <li>Anemoi shows significantly slower proving times and slower verification times compared to  <span class="math">Poseidon(2)B^{\\pi}</span>  across all instances.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Overall, Poseidon(2) <span class="math">B^{\\pi}</span>  provides comparable proof sizes, efficient proving times and offer a significant improvement in verification performance over Vision-32b and Anemoi. In conclusion, our practical results show that Poseidon(2) <span class="math">B^{\\pi}</span>  can be efficiently arithmetized in the binary proof system Binius.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">We provide a plain implementation for each parameter set in Table 1 in Rust. We also implement a binary variant of Anemoi for comparison, as it is the primary existing arithmetization-oriented hash function that targets binary field instantiations.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Across all binary-field instantiations, Poseidon2B<sup> <span class="math">\\pi</span> </sup> consistently delivers the highest throughput, and compared to PoseidonB it yields higher efficiency when  <span class="math">t \\geq 8</span> . This comes from its linear layer amortizes better as the state grows. Anemoi exhibits notably lower throughput and higher latency across all tested state widths. All permutations</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The following description follows the idea of the full-round-skipping trick applied in the CICO-1 setting as outlined in [Bar+22, &sect;4.2], generalized to the CICO-k setting. The goal is to find a k-dimensional affine subspace of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q^t</span>  after the first linear layer such that the input constraints are fulfilled when going in the backwards direction (cf. Fig. 4), that is,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha_{0,0} &amp; \\alpha_{0,1} &amp; \\dots &amp; \\alpha_{0,t-1} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\alpha_{t-1,0} &amp; \\alpha_{t-1,1} &amp; \\dots &amp; \\alpha_{t-1,t-1} \\end{bmatrix}}_{M_{\\varepsilon}^{-1}} \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathcal{S}^{-1}(x_0) - c_0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mathcal{S}^{-1}(x_{t-1}) - c_{t-1} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\star \\\\ 0^k \\end{bmatrix}.</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">To fulfill the input constraints, the following equations need to hold for all  <span class="math">t - k \\le i &lt; t</span> :</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$0 = \\sum_{j=0}^{t-1} \\alpha_{i,j} \\cdot (\\mathcal{S}^{-1}(x_j) - c_j)</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Setting the individual summands  <span class="math">p_i, q_i</span>  to zero yields two equation systems:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">Note that Q is a system of k high-degree equations in k variables, and solving this system gives the coset of the affine subspace we are looking for. On the other hand, P is a system of k equations in  <span class="math">t-k \\ge k</span>  variables, assuming  <span class="math">k \\le \\frac{t}{2}</span> , and we are looking for a k-dimensional subspace of the (t-k)-dimensional solution-space. We proceed as follows:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Split each  <span class="math">p_i</span>  into k subsums  <span class="math">p_{i,\\ell}</span>  by grouping terms with the same index modulo k such that the  <span class="math">\\ell</span> -th subsum collects every k-th term starting from  <span class="math">x_{\\ell}</span>  for  <span class="math">0 \\leq \\ell &lt; k</span> .</li>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where <em>M<sup>&#8467;</sup></em> := <em>t</em>&minus;<em>k</em>&minus;1&minus;<em>&#8467; k</em> .

For sponge instances with capacity <em>c</em> and digest length <em>&chi;</em>, we overall aim for a <em>&chi;</em>-dimensional subspace. We observe the following:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">

      <h4 id="app-a.1.2" class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">A.1.2 Skipping several partial (internal) rounds</h4>

    <p class="text-gray-300">The following description follows the idea of the partial-round-skipping trick introduced in [Bey+20], and detailed in [GKR25]. The goal is to find a finite-dimensional affine subspace  <span class="math">\\mathcal{S}^{(\\ell)} + \\gamma</span>  of  <span class="math">\\mathbb{F}_q^t</span>  which allows to linearize  <span class="math">\\ell \\geq 0</span>  partial rounds, that is,</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathcal{I}^{\\ell}(v+\\gamma) = M_{\\mathcal{I}}^{\\ell} \\times v + \\mathcal{I}^{\\ell}(\\gamma) \\quad \\forall \\ v \\in \\mathcal{S}^{(\\ell)}</span>$
.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">It is easy to check that</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$\\mathcal{S}^{(\\ell)} = \\langle e_0, e_0 \\times M_{\\mathcal{I}}, e_0 \\times M_{\\mathcal{I}}^2, \\dots, e_0 \\times M_{\\mathcal{I}}^{\\ell-1} \\rangle^{\\perp}</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">fulfills the above criterion, as no input difference activates an S-box over  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  partial rounds. In general,  <span class="math">\\mathcal{S}^{(\\ell)}</span>  is of dimension  <span class="math">D := \\dim(\\mathcal{S}^{(\\ell)}) \\geq t - \\min\\{h,\\ell\\}</span> , where h is the multiplicative order of  <span class="math">M_{\\mathcal{I}}</span> . For Poseidon2/Poseidon(2)B, the matrix  <span class="math">M_{\\mathcal{I}}</span>  is carefully selected such that D strictly decreases as  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  increases. Thus, at most t-1 partial rounds can be linearized via a non-trivial subspace.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Applicability.</strong> In order to exploit the partial-round-skipping trick, it is necessary to first map into  <span class="math">\\mathcal{S}^{(\\ell)}</span> . The high-level attack idea can then be summarized as follows:</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="math">$x \\in \\mathbb{F}_p^t \\xrightarrow[(a)]{\\mathcal{I}^s \\circ \\mathcal{E}^{R_F/2} \\circ M_{\\mathcal{E}}(\\cdot)} \\mathcal{S}^{(\\ell)} + \\gamma \\xrightarrow[(b)]{\\mathcal{I}^{\\ell}(\\cdot)} M_{\\mathcal{I}}^{\\ell} \\times \\mathcal{S}^{(\\ell)} + \\mathcal{I}^{\\ell}(\\gamma) \\xrightarrow[(c)]{\\mathcal{E}^{R_F/2} \\circ \\mathcal{I}^{R_P-s-\\ell}(\\cdot)} y \\in \\mathbb{F}_p^t,</span>$</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">where  <span class="math">s \\geq 0</span>  indicates the positioning of the subspace within the partial rounds. In particular, using the subspace trick introduces an additional  <span class="math">D=t-\\ell</span>  variables in the algebraic model, while the mapping into the subspace requires t equations. Overall,  <span class="math">\\ell</span>  is chosen such that all available degrees of freedom are exhausted, i.e., as many partial rounds as possible can be skipped. As shown in [GKR25], for preimage attacks this leads to  <span class="math">\\ell = t - (c + \\chi)</span>  in sponge mode, and  <span class="math">\\ell = t - \\chi</span>  in compression mode. Similarly, in the CICO-k setting, we set  <span class="math">\\ell = t - 2k</span> . For simplicity, we assume  <span class="math">R_P \\geq \\ell</span> .</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">There are two primary ways to model the permutation  <span class="math">\\mathcal{P}</span> , both leading to an under-defined system of equations:</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Direct Forward Equations [Gra+21]: Derive equations for several rounds, potentially covering the entire permutation, in the forward direction. Note that the maximum degree might be reached after a certain number of rounds. <sup>16</sup></li>
    </ol>

    <p class="text-gray-300"> <span class="math">&lt;sup&gt;^{16} \\&lt;/sup&gt;text{We recall that the maximum degree of a polynomial function over } \\mathbb{F}_q^t \\text{ is } t \\cdot (q-1).</span></p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>Working at Round Level [Gra+21; ABM24]: Introduce one variable for each S-box input (except for the first round), and relate its inputs and outputs via a single equation of the S-box degree.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="text-gray-300">By using the available <em>degrees of freedom</em> (DOF), it is possible to retrieve a square system (i.e., same number of variables and equations) and reduce the complexity of the problem.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">For brevity, let  <span class="math">k_1 \\geq 0</span>  and  <span class="math">k_2 &gt; 0</span>  denote the number of input and output constraints, respectively, where  <span class="math">k_1 + k_2 \\leq t</span> . When  <span class="math">k_1 = k_2</span> , we model the CICO-k problem. In preimage attack scenarios in sponge or compression mode,  <span class="math">(k_1, k_2) = (c, \\chi)</span>  and  <span class="math">(0, \\chi)</span> , respectively. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the last  <span class="math">k_1</span>  input elements and the last  <span class="math">k_2</span>  output elements are constrained to zero.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Direct Forward Equations.</strong> Introduce  <span class="math">t-k_1</span>  variables for the permutation inputs, yielding the input state  <span class="math">x=(x_0,\\ldots,x_{t-k_1-1},0,\\ldots,0)</span> . The permutation output is given by t polynomials  <span class="math">p_j:=\\mathcal{P}_j(x)</span>  of degree  <span class="math">\\min\\{d^{R_F+R_P},(t-k_1)\\cdot(2^n-1)\\}</span> , where d is the S-box degree. For compression with feed-forward, enforce  <span class="math">p_j+x_j=0</span>  for  <span class="math">t-k_2\\leq j&lt; t</span> , otherwise  <span class="math">p_j=0</span>  for the same indices. In total, this leads to a polynomial system of  <span class="math">k_2</span>  equations in  <span class="math">t-k_1</span>  variables, with  <span class="math">t-(k_1+k_2)\\geq 0</span>  available DOFs.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">As outlined in Section 5.3.2, different strategies can be used to consume the available DOFs and potentially reduce the solving complexity of the resulting system:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 my-2 ml-4">
      <li>a. Random guessing of input variables: Additionally fix  <span class="math">t (k_1 + k_2)</span>  input variables, yielding a system of  <span class="math">k_2</span>  equations of degree min <span class="math">\\{d^{R_F+R_P}, k_2 \\cdot (2^n 1)\\}</span>  in  <span class="math">k_2</span>  variables.</li>
      <li>b. Skipping the first external full round: If applicable, follow the approach described in App. A.1.1, yielding a system of  <span class="math">k_2</span>  equations of degree  <span class="math">\\min\\{d^{R_F-1+R_P}, k_2 \\cdot (2^n-1)\\}</span>  in  <span class="math">k_2</span>  variables.</li>
      <li>c. Skipping several internal partial rounds: Follow the approach described in App. A.1.2, effectively introducing an additional t constraints and  <span class="math">(k_1 + k_2)</span>  variables to map into an affine subspace that can skip  <span class="math">\\ell = t (k_1 + k_2)</span>  partial rounds. This leads to a system of t equations of degree  <span class="math">\\min\\{d^{R_f+s}, (t-k_1)\\cdot(2^n-1)\\}</span>  in  <span class="math">t-k_1</span>  variables to map into the subspace, and  <span class="math">k_2</span>  equations of degree  <span class="math">\\min\\{d^{R_f+R_P-s-\\ell}, (k_1+k_2)\\cdot(2^n-1)\\}</span>  in  <span class="math">k_1+k_2</span>  variables to fulfill the output constraints, where  <span class="math">R_f = \\frac{R_F}{2}</span>  denotes the number of initial/final full rounds, and s indicates the positioning of the affine subspace within the partial rounds.</li>

    <p class="text-gray-300"><strong>Ideal Degree.</strong> When applying a consistent approach to consume degrees of freedom, the resulting systems exhibit the same ideal degree, as they describe the same underlying variety. The conjectured ideal degrees are given in Tables 6 and 7, and summarized in Table 2. Note that while those conjectures have originally been made for Poseidon2, we performed practical experiments over a binary extension field to confirm that they also apply to Poseidon(2)B; see App. A.3. As stated in Section 5.3.2, Eq. (8), the relation</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">All practical experiments are conducted on a machine with an Intel Xeon E5-2630 v3 @  <span class="math">2.40\\,\\mathrm{GHz}</span>  (using 8 cores) and  <span class="math">378\\,\\mathrm{GB}</span>  RAM under Debian 11 using Magma V2.26-2.</p>

Each experiment was limited to 4 hours due to the large number of test cases.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-300">From the practical results, we observe that the ideal degree remains identical whether the system is modeled via the direct forward equations or at the round level; the difference arises solely from how the degrees of freedom are consumed, that is, by (a) random guessing of input variables, (b) skipping the first full round, or (c) skipping several partial rounds. Moreover, the B&eacute;zout bound often significantly overestimates the ideal degree, which in turn aligns well with our conjectured values given in Table 2.</p>
